	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding, bringing unprecedented opportunities and significant security risks. Among the most appealing attacks on IoT are botnets, typically utilized for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, identity theft, malware distribution, fraud, and spamming. Early detection and mitigation are crucial considering the nature of IoT devices and botnets. Many of these methods deploy machine learning, such as supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning. As IoT devices generate a massive amount of data of high dimensions, not all data contain valuable information. Feeding data without preprocessing might degrade the quality of the detection model. Thus, optimization methods are needed to determine the subsets of the most relevant features to the detection process. This study utilized the effectiveness of Equilibrium Optimization (EO), Battle Royale Optimization (BRO), and Adaptive Equilibrium Optimization (AEO) for feature selection in detecting IoT botnets using the N-BaIoT dataset. The performance of the selected features is evaluated using three classifiers: K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) considering metrics such as number of features, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and time required for feature selection. Our findings indicate the competitive performance of EO and AEO in terms of runtime, number of features selected, and accuracy, compared to recent works on the same dataset.}

Organizations implement Information Security Policies (ISPs) that outline the expected security-related behavior and compliance standards for employees. Ensuring and enhancing ISP compliance and reducing violations is crucial for organizations to maintain their security posture. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to synthesize the existing research on ISP compliance and violations to identify the underlying factors behind employee policy violations and delve into the factors that promote compliance with ISPs. In order to provide a theoretical foundation for understanding these behaviors, this SLR identifies the prominent theories used to explain ISP compliance and violation. A comprehensive search is conducted across different academic databases, applying defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select the relevant studies between 2012 and 2023. To understand intentional violations, we categorize and analyze studies on ISP violations based on Moral Disengagement, Neutralization and Deterrence, Stress, and Monitoring mechanisms. For ISP compliance, we categorize and analyze studies based on individual-level decision-making and organizational-level factors. We identified forty-seven factors that influence compliance behavior and forty-one factors that determine non-compliance behavior. Fourteen common factors were identified from prior literature, which were determinants of both compliance and violation behaviors, with opposite directions of influence. By considering both compliance and noncompliance simultaneously, organizations can develop more effective strategies for enhancing compliance and mitigating noncompliance.}

Two primary obstacles are faced by current intrusion detection systems: substantial computational demands and stringent data privacy regulations, complicating both efficient deployment and the safeguarding of data privacy. Consequently, there is a pressing need for intrusion detection solutions that are both efficient and considerate of privacy concerns. This paper introduces FED-IoV, an innovative intrusion detection method tailored for the IoV, leveraging a federated learning architecture. FED-IoV aims to collaboratively perform detection tasks across distributed edge devices, thereby minimizing data privacy risks. Vehicular communication traffic data is transformed into images, and a bespoke, efficient model, MobileNet-Tiny, is employed for feature extraction, rendering FED-IoV capable of achieving high detection accuracy whilst being viable for deployment on devices with limited resources. Through evaluation against the authoritative datasets CAN-Intrusion and CICIDS2017, exceptional accuracy rates of 98.51 % and 97.74 %, respectively, were demonstrated by FED-IoV within a federated learning context, and excellent detection capabilities on imbalanced datasets were also shown. Moreover, a prediction latency of under 10 milliseconds per sample was maintained on devices with limited computational power, such as the Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, showcasing significantly better accuracy and real-time performance relative to existing approaches. The successful deployment of FED-IoV ushers in a novel, privacy-preserving, and efficient intrusion detection solution for IoV security.}

	abstract = {In the digitally connected world cybersecurity is paramount, phishing where attackers pose as trusted entities to steal sensitive data, looms large. The proliferation of phishing attacks on the internet poses a substantial threat to individuals and organizations, compromising sensitive information and causing financial and reputational damage. This study's goal is to establish an automated system for the early detection and prevention of phishing websites, thereby enhancing online security and protecting users from cyber threats. This research initially employs One Hot Encoding (OHE) mechanism-based pre-processing mechanism that converts every URL string into a numerical vector with a particular dimension. This study utilizes two feature selection techniques which are transfer learning-based feature extraction using DarkNet19 and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to select the value of the most important feature. The robust security mechanisms are presented to prevent phishing attacks and safeguard personal information on websites. List-based deep learning-based systems to prevent and detect phishing URLs more efficiently. The study proposes a transformer-based Deep Belief Network (TB-DBN), a veritable pre-trained deep transformer network model for phishing behaviour detection. A cross-validation technique with grid search hyper-parameter tuning based on the Intelligence Binary Bat Algorithm (IBBA) was designed using the proposed hybrid model. Predictions were made to classify the phishing URLs using a probabilistic estimation guided boosting classifier model and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1- score. The risk level associated with the URL will be assessed based on various factors, such as the source's reputation, content analysis results, and behavioural anomalies. The computational complexity of DL model training is influenced by various factors, such as the model's complexity, the training data's size, and the optimization algorithm exploited, for training. The outcome demonstrates that tweaking variables increases the effectiveness of Python-based deep learning systems. The findings of the proposed method excel, achieving an accuracy of 99.4 %, precision of 99.2 %, recall of 99.3 %, and an F1-score of 99.2 %. This innovative automatic phishing website detection and prevention model, based on a Transformer-based Deep Belief Network, offers advanced accuracy and adaptability, strengthening cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive user information and mitigate the substantial threat of phishing attacks in the digitally connected world.}

	abstract = {Vulnerabilities and Trojans in hardware design may cause sensitive data to be leaked and tampered. Information flow tracking technology can effectively verify the confidentiality and integrity of hardware design. Currently, this technology mainly analyzes the reachability of information flow and lacks fine-grained analysis of information flow paths. It is difficult to find structural defects in information flow paths and malicious sensitive information processes in hardware design. To solve above problem, we propose Path-aware Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (PDIFT) technology, which performs taint tracking and path tracking while sensitive information is propagated. It analyzes the propagation of sensitive information in hardware design with fine-grained taint label propagation logic and inserts path label propagation logic only on basic blocks divided by branch nodes, which greatly simplifies the path tracing overhead compared to the full node sequence tracing on the path. Experiments have shown that compared to CellIFT, PDIFT has a 12.1% increase in static analysis time and a 0.1% increase in dynamic validation time. The average instrumentation area cost of each basic block has increased by 16.4\num\n2\n. In terms of detection capability, PDIFT makes up for the limitation of false negatives in traditional taint tracking technology through joint analysis of path labels and taint labels, then detect problems such as insufficient iterations of encryption components and malicious processing of important assets, thereby improving the accuracy of hardware security verification.}

	abstract = {With the development of information technology, many devices are connected and automated by networks. Unmanned Areal Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are one of the most popular devices that can perform various tasks. However, the risk of cyberattacks on UAVs is increasing as UAV utilization grows. These cyberattacks can cause serious safety problems, such as crashes. Therefore, it is essential to detect these attacks and take countermeasures. As a countermeasure, intrusion detection system (IDS) is widely adopted. To implement IDS for UAVs, it should be lightweight and be able to detect unknown attacks as a requirement. We propose GAN-based UAV IDS Enhancement (GUIDE) to meet the requirements. The GUIDE employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) for integer-valued sequence data augmentation to enhance an IDS’s performance on known and unknown attacks. We used five GANs: SeqGAN, MaskGAN, RankGAN, StepGAN, and LeakGAN; we used four non-learning augmentation methods for the comparative experiment: oversampling, undersampling, noise addition, and random generation. The experimental results demonstrated that the synthetic data generated by GANs improved the detection of known attacks (up to 37 percentage points) and unknown attacks (up to 30 percentage points) while maintaining stable IDS performance. We also analyzed the synthetic data by employing Jensen–Shannon divergence, synthetic ranking agreement, and visualization; we confirmed that the synthetic data contained the characteristics of real data and could be used for training the IDS.}

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is widely used in automobiles to interconnect safety-critical electronic control units (ECUs). Unfortunately, CAN does not have inherent security mechanisms as originally designed, which has drawn significant attention from the research community. Currently, the mainstream CAN protection strategy is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, many statistics-based IDSs are unable to identify the identifier (ID) of the attacked message; they can only identify anomalies within a specific time window. Moreover, these systems are often tested solely on public datasets, lacking theoretical validation of their effectiveness. To address these shortcomings, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a dynamic graph. The graph is dynamically constructed based on the arrival of messages, and features are extracted concurrently. By utilizing the distribution of features extracted during the offline phase, our system achieves real-time detection of incoming messages and identifies the ID of the attacked message. Additionally, we introduce a method to theoretically validate the detection system through permutation and probabilistic statistical analysis. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that our proposed IDS can effectively detect a wide range of attacks with reduced detection time and memory usage.}

The capabilities of cybercriminals are expanding as they adopt new technologies like zero-day exploits or new business models such as hacker-as-a-service. While AI capabilities can improve cybersecurity measures, this same technology can also be utilized as an offensive cyber weapon to create sophisticated and intricate cyber-attacks. This paper describes an AI-powered mechanism for the automatic generation of attack techniques, ranging from initial attack vectors to impact-related actions. It presents a comprehensive analysis of simulated attacks by highlighting the attack tactics and techniques that are more likely to be generated using AI technology, specifically Large Language Model (LLM) technology. The work empirically demonstrates that LLM technology can be easily used by cybercriminals for attack execution. Moreover, the solution can complement Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platforms and frameworks that automate the security assessment in a controlled manner. BAS could be enhanced with AI-powered attack simulation by bringing forth new ways to automatically program multiple attack techniques, even multiple versions of the same attack technique. Therefore, AI-enhanced attack simulation can assist in ensuring digital systems are bulletproof and protected against a great variety of attack vectors and actions.}

To improve the malware detection performance and reduce its reliance on expert experience, deep learning technology has been widely used. However, as the complexity of deep learning models continues to increase, it rapidly increases the consumption of hardware resources. At the same time, anti-detection technology such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used to evade Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based detection methods. In this paper, we propose a new classification model based on an improved lightweight neural network that can effectively improve the execution efficiency and detection performance of malware detection methods against adversarial malware samples. First, our method uses local-information-entropy-based image generation technology to construct effective image feature vectors. Then, the performance of the lightweight neural network model ESPNetV2 is improved from four aspects. Finally, a new adversarial malware generation model called Mal-WGANGP is proposed. It can automatically generate a large number of adversarial samples to robust our model. In order to evaluate our method, we construct several experiments and compare the detection performance of our method with 19 other novel efficient neural network detection models. Experimental results show that our image enhancement method and detection model have the highest detection accuracy of adversarial samples.}

However, as highlighted by previous researches address randomization is not a silver bullet and can be circumvented by exploiting other types of information disclosed by the protocol such as counters or timing. In this work, we propose two novel attack to break address randomization in BLE exploiting side information in the form of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). More precisely, we demonstrate how RSSI measurements, extracted from received BLE advertising packets, can be used to link together the traces emitted by the same device or directly re-identify it despite address randomization. The proposed attacks leverage the distribution of RSSI to create a fingerprint of devices with an empirical evaluation on various scenarios demonstrating their effectiveness. For instance in the static context, in which devices remain at the same position, the proposed approach yields a re-identification accuracy of up to 97%, which can even be boosted to perfect accuracy by increasing the number of receivers controlled by the adversary. We also discuss the factors influencing the success of the attacks and evaluate two possible countermeasures whose effectiveness is limited, highlighting the difficulty in mitigating this threat.}

With its pervasive adoption, robust security measures become imperative. Integrating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) into cloud computing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) addresses these challenges. IDSs serve as attentive protectors, monitoring network traffic and responding to breaches promptly, enhancing security across industries reliant on cloud services. Similarly, IDS integration in WSNs ensures the security of mission-critical operations, despite resource constraints and dynamic topologies, facilitated by cloud computing. This research proposes a hybrid IDS approach, leveraging the NSL-KDD dataset and methodologies like Intrusion Support Scalar Impact Rate (ISSIR), Optimized Support Vector Machine (OSVM), Extended Long-Short-Term Memory (ELSTM), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), enhancing intrusion detection efficacy. ISSIR aids in feature selection, OSVM mitigates localization errors, ELSTM enables precise anomaly detection, and MLPNN provides robust defense mechanisms. Each method is integrated into a collaborative framework to address specific challenges in detecting intrusions with higher accuracy and reduced false positives. The interplay between these methodologies strengthens the overall intrusion detection framework, addressing the dynamic nature of cybersecurity threats. Results demonstrate the superior performance of MLPNN across various metrics, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately predicting outcomes compared to other models. The proposed MLPNN hybrid system achieves an accuracy of 99.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {With the increasing size and complexity of network, network traffic becomes more and more correlated with each other, and the traditional manner of presenting network traffic in a Euclidean structure is difficult to effectively capture the correlation information of network traffic. In contrast, graph structured data has gained much attention in recent years due to its ability to represent the correlation between different traffic flows; In addition, models and algorithms related to Graph Convolution Neural network (GCN) have been used for malicious traffic detection. However, existing GCN-based malicious traffic detection methods still suffer from incomplete description of the flow-level features of network traffic, imperfect traffic correlation establishment mechanism and failure to distinguish the importance of features during model training. Based on this, this study proposes a malicious traffic detection method called GCN-MHSA based on Graph Convolutional Neural network and Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism. Firstly, the flow-level features of network traffic are populated and more information close to the features are selected to describe the network traffic; And then, the link homogeneity is used to establish the correlations between network traffic; Moreover, multi-head self-attention mechanism is introduced in the GCN model to provide larger weight to important features; Finally, an improved GCN is used as a deep learning model to detect malicious traffic. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available network traffic datasets and a real network traffic dataset show that the proposed GCN-MHSA method performs better than five baselines in terms of detection effect and stability, with an improvement of about 2.4% in accuracy, recall and F1-measure as well as an improvement of about 2.1% in precision.}

	abstract = {The domain name system (DNS) serves as a fundamental component of the Internet infrastructure, but it is also exploited by attackers in various cyber-crimes, underscoring the significance of malicious domain detection (MDD). Recent advances show that graph-based models exhibit potential for inferring malicious domains and demonstrate superior performance. However, acquiring large-scale and high-quality graph datasets for MDD proves challenging for individual security institutes. Hence, a promising research direction involves employing vertical federated graph learning scheme to unite diverse security institutes and enhance local datasets resulting in more robust and powerful detection models. Nonetheless, directly applying vertical federated graph neural networks for MDD confronts challenges posed by noisy labels and noisy edges among security institutes, which ultimately diminish detection performance. This paper introduces a novel vertical federated learning framework, called MDD-FedGNN, that applies contrastive learning with two different encoders to deal with noisy labels and employs a new loss function based on the information bottleneck theory to handle noisy edges. Comparative experiments are conducted on a publicly available DNS dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of MDD-FedGNN in addressing the challenges of noisy labels and edges in vertical federated graph learning. The results demonstrate that MDD-FedGNN outperforms baseline methods, confirming the feasibility of training more powerful malicious domain detection models through data sharing and vertical federated learning among different security agencies.}
