	abstract = {Today, we are living in the realm of Internet of Things (IoT) where simple objects are embedded with the capabilities to understand and operate in its surroundings for offering distinct services to the users. These objects are shipped with their user interfaces that facilitate user to perform administrative activities on the devices using a web browser linked to the device's server. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is the most prevalent web application's vulnerability, exploited by an attacker to compromise the embedded devices. This research work is focused towards the development of an approach to defend against XSS attack to safeguard embedded devices deployed in intelligent IoT system. It performs identification through comparing injected strings with the blacklisted attack vectors and mitigates its harmful effects by implementing filtering method in an optimized fashion. It is a fog-enabled approach that operates locally to identify the compromised device within the IoT network. We demonstrate attack exploitation on two smart devices including digital IP Camera and wireless router and then tested the performance of our proposed approach on them. The experimental results highlight the efficacy of the approach as it attains an accuracy of 0.9 and above, on both the tested platforms.}

	abstract = {Web development technology has experienced significant progress. The creation of JavaScript has highly enriched the interactive ability of the client. However, the attacker uses the dynamic characteristics of the JavaScript language to embed malicious code into web pages to achieve the purpose of smuggling, redirection, and so on. Traditional methods based on static feature detection are therefore difficult to detect malicious code after confusion, and the method based on dynamic analysis is inefficient. To meet these challenges, this paper proposes a static detection model JStrong based on graph neural network. The model first generates an abstract syntax tree from the JavaScript source code, and then adds data flow and control flow information into the program dependency graph. In addition, we embed the nodes and edges of the graph into the feature vector and fully learn the features of the whole graph through the graph neural network. We take advantage of a real-world dataset collected from the top website and GitHub to evaluate JStrong and compare it to the state-of-the-art method. Experimental results show that JStrong achieves near-perfect classification performance and is superior to the state-of-the-art method.}

	abstract = {Controller area network (CAN) bus which provides efficient, reliable and robust communication between electronic control units (ECUs) is the most frequently used protocol for in-vehicle networks. However, the lack of security mechanisms in the CAN protocol makes it vulnerable to inside and outside cyber-attacks. Therefore, an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a widely used method to detect malicious activities, is preferred to improve the security of the CAN buses. In spite of the fact that various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are employed to increase the performance of IDSs, obtaining high classification performance is still a challenge for them. First, a lot of irrelevant and redundant features in the datasets result in long computational times with low detection performances. Second, different classification performances are acquired based on classifiers and a combination of the features. Third, many of the models suffer from unknown and different types of attacks. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection framework is proposed in this paper based on feature selection and classifier. Initially, we propose a meta-heuristic algorithm called modified genetic algorithm (MGA) m-feature selection for dimension reduction by selecting optimal feature subset based on k-fold cross validation. Then, we utilize five different linear and nonlinear classifiers: support vector classifier (SVC), logistic regression classifier (LRC), decision tree classifier (DTC), k-nearest neighbors classifier (KNC), and linear discriminant analysis classifier (LDAC) as candidate classifiers to develop an efficient IDS. Finally, we select the best classifier from the candidates and build an IDS. The experimental results reveal that the proposed MGA-DTC presents a better performance in terms of several metrics based on not only the HCRL-car hacking dataset but also UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017 datasets.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of active intrusion detection over network traffic streams. Existing works create clusters for known classes and manually label instances outside the clusters for detecting novel attack classes and concept drift, yet several challenges are present. First, these methods assume that different classes of network traffic distribute far from each other in feature space, while similar attack classes could violate this assumption. It makes the true novel classes and concept drift undetectable, therefore a degraded performance. Second, prior works depending on heavily calculating and retraining cannot achieve efficient incremental updates over the infinite and high-speed streams of network traffic. Last, related methods rarely leverage the domain knowledge in intrusion detection. To address these issues, we propose DFAID, a Density-aware and Feature-deviated Active Intrusion Detection framework over network traffic streams. We first design the mask density score and the feature deviation score to maximize the effectiveness of labeled instances, effectively detecting novel attack classes and the concept drift when similar classes exist. Then, DFAID leverages robust incremental clustering structures to group instances in local regions, relieving the burden on the speed and reducing effects of noisy instances. Last, we further present DFAID-DK by incorporating the Domain Knowledge of temporal correlations between network attacks to correct the wrong predictions. Extensive experiments on two well-known benchmarks, CIC-IDS2017 and ISCX-2012, demonstrate that DFAID and its variation DFAID-DK both achieve significant improvement compared with related methods in terms of f1-score (21.7%, 22.7%) on average, and its running speed is an order of magnitude faster.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to benign examples. Increasing the attack success rate usually requires a larger noise magnitude, which leads to noticeable noise. To this end, we propose a Transformed Gradient method (TG), which achieves a higher attack success rate with lower perturbations against the target model, i.e. an ensemble of black-box defense models. It consists of three steps: original gradient accumulation, gradient amplification, and gradient truncation. Besides, we introduce the Fr\ne\n´\nchet Inception Distance (FID) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) respectively to evaluate fidelity and perceived distance from the original example, which is more comprehensive than only using\nL\n∞\nnorm as evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we propose optimizing coefficients of the source-model ensemble to improve adversarial attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the perturbations of adversarial examples generated by our proposed method are less than the state-of-the-art baselines, namely MI, DI, TI, RF-DE based on vanilla iterative FGSM and their combinations. Compared with the baseline method, the average black-box attack success rate and total score are improved by 6.6% and 13.8, respectively.

	abstract = {As an effective method to protect the daily access to sensitive data against malicious attacks, the audit mechanism has been widely deployed in various practical fields. In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the leakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system usually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in the audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender. However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the attacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper, we introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential audit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally control the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an optimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively maximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the security management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle different access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient manner.}

Step & Turn addresses the fundamental limitations of the conventional physical access control schemes, i.e., users having a specific knowledge or possessing a particular device or token, to satisfy both usability and security requirements. We design and develop a prototype of Step & Turn by exploiting two natural human behaviors: single footstep and hand-movement to authenticate the users. To evaluate Step & Turn, we design multi-class verification models using three different classifiers. The system achieves a True Acceptance Rate of 97.25% at False Acceptance Rate of 0.01% on a dataset of 1,600 samples collected from 40 participants. We also assess its usability using the System Usability Scale. The solution obtained a score of\n≈\n76.72 providing evidence that users have a positive perspective towards the use of Step & Turn.}

	abstract = {Alert correlation is a set of techniques that process alerts raised by intrusion detection systems to eliminate redundant alerts, reduce the number of false positives, and reconstruct attack scenarios. Since Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) exhibit both a physical and a cyber domain, they present unique challenges for alert correlation. The presence of heterogeneous domains each with its specific threats has led to the development of multi-domain detection techniques. Indeed, some detection approaches rely solely on observations at the level of the cyber domain, while other approaches will monitor the physical process. Although these two approaches are complementary, the nature of the information carried by the detection alerts differs. In this article, we develop an alert correlation framework tailored explicitly for ICSs. We combine physical domain intrusion detection alerts with more classical cyber domain intrusion detection alerts. We develop a correlation approach that maps physical domain alerts into the cyber domain using alert enrichment. We also propose a specific alert selection for correlation that adapts to the state of the physical process by dynamically adjusting the size of the selected alert window. We test our approach on a realistic experimental setup with and we publicly release all datasets used to derive our results. Our cross-domain correlation methodology achieves better correlation metrics compared to classical temporal-based correlation approaches in terms of false correlation rate, missing correlation rate and alert reduction.}

Then, drawing on the synthesized CSFs and blending them with IT capability theory, we present an overarching cybersecurity CSF framework building upon 79 cybersecurity elements grouped into 11 CSFs under five dimensions of cybersecurity capability: organizational, infrastructural, strategic, process, and external. In addition, the descriptive analysis of the search results reveals the importance of the various factors and capabilities, the trend of the cybersecurity capability dimensions, the frequency and types of research methods, and the contextual impact of the factors. This research makes an important contribution to the literature on cybersecurity management. The CSF framework serves as the foundation for future researchers interested in measuring organizational cybersecurity success. In addition, practitioners can employ the synthesized CSFs and associated elements to guide their cybersecurity management.}

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can exploit, disrupt, change, prevent or damage cloud services. Accurate and timely detection and prevention of these attacks are very important in terms of ensuring information security. During the COVID-19 period, the increase in the use of information technologies and especially the internet has made cyber attacks a real concern. Deep learning (DL) has become widely used for the purpose of detecting and preventing cyber attacks to provide information security. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based system (LSTM-CLOUD) which was designed for the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks in a public cloud network environment was proposed. The design of the system is based on a signature-based attack detection approach. The LSTM-CLOUD has two modules defined in the study: detection and defense. The function of the first module of the system was determined as detecting the occurrence of DDoS attacks with the LSTM DL model developed in this study with an accuracy rate of 99.83% on the CICDDoS2019 data set. The function of the second module was determined as activating the defense mechanism to protect the cloud systems when attacks are detected. The comparison results showed that our LSTM model had a performance as good as those in the previous studies conducted with different DL algorithms on the same and different datasets. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the LSTM model developed in this study in detecting the occurrence of attacks.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNN) models have been widely applied in many tasks. However, recent researches have shown that DNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A number of backdoor attacks on DNN models have been proposed, but almost all the existing backdoor attacks are digital backdoor attacks. However, when launching backdoor attacks in the real physical world, the attack performance will be severely degraded due to a variety of physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a robust physical backdoor attack method, named physical transformations for backdoors (PTB), to implement the backdoor attacks against DNN models in real physical world. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a robust physical backdoor attack with real physical triggers working under complex physical conditions. We use real physical objects as the triggers, and perform a series of physical transformations on the injected backdoor instances during model training, so as to simulate various transformations that a backdoor instance may experience in real physical world, thus ensures its physical robustness. Experimental results on face recognition model demonstrate that, compared with normal backdoor attacks without PTB, the proposed attack method can significantly improve the attack performance in real physical world. Under various complex physical conditions, by injecting only a very small ratio (0.5%) of backdoor instances, the attack success rate of physical backdoor attack with the PTB method is 78% (Square), 82% (Triangle), 79% (Glasses) on YouTube Aligned Face dataset, and 78% (Square), 86% (Triangle), 85% (Glasses) on VGG Face dataset, respectively, while the attack success rate of backdoor attacks without PTB is only 5% (Square), 11% (Triangle), 9% (Glasses) on YouTube Aligned Face dataset and 21% (Square), 20% (Triangle), 13% (Glasses) on VGG Face dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method will not affect the normal performance of the DNN model. In addition, experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed robust physical backdoor attack can evade the detection of three backdoor defense methods.}

However, the existing hierarchical histogram publication schemes have high sensitivity without considering the inherent redundancy of real-life histograms. In addition, the existing histogram compression schemes compress the whole histogram with high sensitivity. To address these issues, we present a histogram publication scheme, which combines histogram compression and hierarchical histogram to increase the accuracy of range queries. In particular, we propose a compression method base on coarse division and dynamic budget allocation to get an efficient compressed histogram, which can decrease the sensitivity of compression method and increase the allocated privacy budget for each division in the same privacy level. The accuracy of released histogram by our proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes. The comparison of simulation results among two latest schemes, a classic hierarchical tree scheme and our scheme show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Currently, microservices are trending as the most popular software application design architecture. Software organisations are also being targeted by more cyber-attacks every day and newer security measures are in high demand. One available measure is the application of anomaly detection, which is defined as the discovery of irregular or unusual activity that occurs to a greater or lesser degree than normal occurrences in a data series. In this paper, we continue existing work where various real-world cyber-attacks are executed against a running microservices application, and the application traffic is logged and returned in the form of distributed traces. A Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network is used to model the set of distributed traces and learn the spatial and temporal dependencies of the application traffic. Subsequently, the model is used to make predictions for ongoing microservice activity and threshold-based anomaly detection is applied to detect irregular microservice activity indicating the presence of seeded cyber security attacks, or anomalies. The cyber-attacks used to evaluate this approach include a brute force attack, a batch registration of bot accounts and a distributed denial of service attack.}

	abstract = {Sensors in the smartphone play a vital role in various user-friendly mobile services. The mobile application requires user permission to access the permission imposed sensors and not for other sensors. The sensors in the smartphone are vulnerable to various attacks. The attackers can exploit these sensors to trigger malware, extract the sensitive information of users and other nearby devices, and expose users’ confidential information. We propose SBTDDL, a novel context-aware framework for detecting sensor-based threats on Android smartphones using deep learning. In our work, (a) we identify the sensor-based threats by using the state (on and off) of the sensors in the smartphone for different user activities, (b) binary classification is performed in the sequence prediction model to classify the benign and malicious activities on the device, (c) SBTDDL performs better in detecting the sensor-based threats compared to the state-of-art existing methods by attaining the accuracy of 99% in identifying benign and malicious activities, (d) SBTDDL also detects the malicious activity occurring like benign activity, and the performance is not affected when the total number of benign and malicious activities increases.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNS) have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. But the adversarial perturbations are generated for specific input samples, and the perturbations of one sample cannot be applied to other samples. In this paper, we propose a method to search for the backdoor of the natural language processing (NLP) model under the black-box condition, and we find that the universal attack triggers exist in the adversarial samples. The method includes two steps. The first step is to extract aggressive words in the adversarial sample to form the adversarial knowledge base under the black-box condition. The second step is to generate universal attack triggers by minimizing the target prediction results of a batch of samples. When we add the generated trigger to any benign input, the prediction accuracy of the DNNS model can be reduced to close to zero. The experimental results show that our method can achieve a high attack success rate with a short trigger (e.g., more than 90% using only a trigger of length 3 when attacking BiLSTM on SST-2). In addition, experiments show that our method has higher transferability. Finally, for the backdoor vulnerabilities in the NLP models, we did two defense experiments: abnormal word detection and word frequency analysis, which improve the NLP model’s ability of resisting backdoor attacks.}

	abstract = {Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a certificate-based technology that helps in authenticating systems identities. HTTPS/TLS relies mainly on PKI to minimize fraud over the Internet. Nowadays, websites utilize CDNs to improve user experience, performance, and resilience against cyber attacks. However, combining HTTPS/TLS with CDNs has raised new security challenges. In any PKI system, keeping private keys private is of utmost importance. However, it has become the norm for CDN-powered websites to violate that fundamental assumption. Several solutions have been proposed to make HTTPS CDN-friendly. However, protection of private keys from the very instance of generation; and how they can be made secure against exposure by malicious (CDN) administrators and malware remain unexplored. We utilize trusted execution environments to protect private keys by never exposing them to human operators or untrusted software. We design Blindfold to protect private keys in HTTPS/TLS infrastructures, including CAs, website on-premise servers, and CDNs. We implemented a prototype to assess Blindfold’s performance and performed several experiments on both the micro and macro levels. We found that Blindfold slightly outperforms SoftHSM in key generation by 1% while lagging by 0.01% for certificate issuance operations.}

However, the majority of research on information security skills has been conducted in homogenous groups of people. The purpose of this study was to describe self-assessed information security skills of the population of Finland and factors associated with the skills. A population survey covering inhabitants aged 20 and upwards was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021. The cross-sectional dataset was weighted (n = 6023) to ensure it represented the population. Descriptive statistics were used to establish an initial understanding. Then a regression analysis was conducted to identify the variables that were associated with information security skills. The results demonstrate that 78% of the respondents assessed their information security skills as good. There was a strong positive association between Internet skills and information security skills. Other factors that demonstrated a statistically significant association were age, level of education, financial situation, e-service use, information security concerns, functional health deficits, and major depression. Even though the majority of people were confident in their information security skills in the online environment, there was evidence of a skills gap that affected people in all age groups, more often senior citizens. The findings of this study increase our understanding of information security skills at the population level. The results can be used to identify groups who are not confident in their information security skills and for designing safer e-services and education or guidelines on information security.}

	abstract = {In the current cloud computing era, outsourcing overloaded computations to cloud servers has become an increasingly popular computing paradigm. Meanwhile, face recognition (FR), as a typical and extensively deployed biometric authentication technique in the real world, always involves time-consuming large-scale matrix operations or complex optimization problems. Therefore, it is a naturally actual demand to study the cloud/edge server-assisted FR algorithm. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the FR data and the incredibility of the cloud/edge server make this intriguing computing paradigm suffer from many security challenges. In this paper, we focus on the popular\nSRC\n-based FR and, for the first time, present a high-efficiency and secure outsourcing design for this algorithm. The key technique ingredient that emerged in our design is a new norm-preserving matrix transformation which is utilized to outsource the heavy\nℓ\n1\n-minimization problem in\nSRC\n-based FR. This novel technique makes our design well protect the critical privacy information in\nSRC\n-based FR and discern the dishonest server with an optimal probability of 1. Simultaneously, compared with existing linear programming outsourcing algorithms, our design is tailored for\nSRC\n-based FR and enables the client to gain considerable computational savings without significantly increasing the cloud/edge server’s computational load. Also, we corroborate our theoretical claims by conducting extensive experiments on the publicly available database.}

In the Windows operating system (OS), Application Programming Interface (API) calls are an attractive and distinguishable feature for malware analysis and detection as they can properly reflect the actions of portable executable (PE) files. In this paper, we propose MalSPM, an intelligent malware detection system based on sequential pattern mining (SPM) for the analysis and classification of malware behavior during executions. A dataset that contains sequences of API calls made by different malware on Windows OS is abstracted into a suitable format. SPM algorithms are first used on the corpus to find frequent API calls and their patterns. Moreover, sequential rules between API calls patterns as well as maximal and closed frequent API calls patterns are discovered. Obtained frequent patterns are then used for the classification of different malware. Seven classifiers are used and their performance is compared by using various metrics. Moreover, the performance of MalSPM is compared with existing state-of-the-art malware detection approaches and obtained results show that MalSPM outperforms these approaches.}

	abstract = {Software security is a complex topic, and for development projects it can be challenging to assess what security is necessary and cost-effective. Agile Software Development (ASD) values self-management. Thus, teams and their Product Owners are expected to also manage software security prioritisation. In this paper we build on the notion that security experts who want to influence the priority given to security in ASD need to do this through interactions and support for teams rather than prescribing certain activities or priorities. But to do this effectively, there is a need to understand what hinders and supports teams in prioritising security. Based on a longitudinal case study, this article offers insight into the strategy used by one security professional in an SME to influence the priority of security in software development projects in the company. The main result is a model of influences on security prioritisation that can assist in understanding what supports or hinders the prioritisation of security in ASD, thus providing recommendations for security professionals. Two alternative strategies are outlined for software security in ASD – prescribed and emerging – where we hypothesise that an emerging approach can be more relevant for SMEs doing ASD, and that this can impact how such companies should consider software security maturity.}

	abstract = {WebAssembly is a new binary instruction format that allows targeted compiled code written in high-level languages to be executed with near-native speed by the browser’s JavaScript engine. However, given that WebAssembly binaries can be compiled from unsafe languages like C/C++, classical code vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or format strings can be transferred over from the original programs down to the cross-compiled binaries. As a result, this possibility of incorporating vulnerabilities in WebAssembly modules has widened the attack surface of modern web applications. This paper presents Wasmati, a static analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in WebAssembly binaries. It is based on the generation of a code property graph (CPG), a program representation previously adopted for detecting vulnerabilities in various languages but hitherto unapplied to WebAssembly. We formalize the definition of CPG for WebAssembly, introduce techniques to generate CPG for complex WebAssembly, and present four different query specification languages for finding vulnerabilities by traversing a program’s CPG. We implemented ten queries capturing different vulnerability types and extensively tested Wasmati on four heterogeneous datasets. We show that Wasmati can scale the generation of CPGs for large real-world applications and can efficiently find vulnerabilities for all our query types. We have also tested our tool on WebAssembly binaries collected in the wild and identified several potential vulnerabilities, some of which we have manually confirmed to exist unless the enclosing application properly sanitizes the interaction with such affected binaries.}

Novel generations of RSs have been developed based on the latest AI and machine learning (ML) technologies such as big data RSs, ML-based RSs, explainable RSs, fusion-based RSs, etc. However, the characteristics of modern RSs raise new security and privacy issues because of the sensitivity of users’ data and its vulnerability to being illegally accessed. Moreover, there is a lack of thorough reviews that explain the current privacy and security challenges in RSs and where the actual research is heading. To overcome these issues, this paper sheds light on the existing security and privacy concerns in modern RSs. It provides a comprehensive survey of recent research efforts on security and privacy preservation in RSs. Typically, the security and privacy aspects in advanced RSs and the latest contributions are first discussed based on a well-defined taxonomy. Next, the applications of secure and privacy-preserving RSs are studied. Moving forward, a critical analysis is conducted to (i) highlight the merits and drawbacks of existing frameworks and (ii) draw the essential findings. Lastly, future directions that attract significant research and development attention are explained.}

IT security is an overarching task for managers and specialists that currently receives little attention in digitalization projects. Therefore, the strategic potential of IT security mostly remains untapped due to a lack of appropriate decision-making and communication tools that support project managers to address IT security consciously. This work tackles this issue by introducing a method to strategically consider IT security in digitalization projects using a design science approach. As a result, three strategic variants of IT security in digitalization projects and their underlying drivers were identified. By consolidating this knowledge into an applicable artifact, this work helps explain existing action patterns in organizations.

Researchers use machine learning techniques to design effective intrusion detection systems. In this study, we proposed an intrusion detection system that includes preprocessing procedures and a deep learning model to detect DDoS attacks. For this purpose, various models based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been evaluated in terms of detection performance and real-time performance. We tested the suggested model using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which is frequently used in the literature. We applied preprocess techniques such as feature elimination, random subset selection, feature selection, duplication removal, and normalization to the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. As a result, better recognition performance was obtained for the training and testing evaluations. According to the test results, 99.99% for binary and 99.30% for multiclass accuracy using the CNN-based inception like model gave the best results among the proposed models. Also, the inference time of the proposed model for various sizes of test data looks promising compared to baseline models with a smaller number of trainable parameters. The proposed IDS system, together with the preprocessing methods, provides better results when compared to state-of-the-art studies.}

As one of the most important statistical models, topic model is widely used in various applications. However, whether adversarial examples exhibit good transferability across topic models has never been explored. In this paper, we propose an effective adversarial example generator TopicAttack to disturb the inference of a target victim topic model and an ensemble algorithm TopicAttack+ to further increase transferability. TopicAttack exploits the words of high importance and constructs adversarial examples via synonym transformation. TopicAttack+ searches the optimal model ensemble given a set of prescribed substitutes, then generate adversarial examples of stronger transferability. Numerically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the benchmark datasets AP, NIPS and 20News. In particular, given eight benchmark substitute models, TopicAttack disturbs them all effectively by achieving high Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; and TopicAttack+ significantly improves the average transferability performance on NIPS from 1.308 to 1.695.}

	abstract = {With its irreversibility, low computational cost, and high storage efficiency, biometric hashing is widely used in privacy-preserving biometric recognition systems, yet its security has been recently challenged due to the emergence of relation-based attacks (RA). To address this issue, we model and analyse the RA, and discover that maximizing the conditional min-entropy of the signs of inter-class distance differences in the original space and hash space can minimize the leakage of the distance relation on the original biometric. Consequently, we develop a Secure Biometric Hashing scheme against Relation-Based Attacks (SBH-RA). SBH-RA maximizes the conditional min-entropy by using the cosine function as a distance mapping function. Meanwhile, it learns hash codes by a classification loss and quantization loss to ensure the accuracy of recognition. Our study demonstrates that SBH-RA not only offers higher security but also yields comparable or even superior recognition performance over existing biometric hashing methods experimentally and theoretically. Given 1024 bits hash codes from SBH-RA, it brings a decrease of 21% in Equal Error Rate on face dataset LFW compared with widely used Biohashing. Besides, even under white-box attacks, the probability of a successful attack is smaller than\n1.69\n×\n2\n−\n346\n.}
