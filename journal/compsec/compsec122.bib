	abstract = {The vast body of research in the Android malware detection domain has demonstrated that machine learning can provide high performance for mobile malware detection. However, the learning models have been usually evaluated with data sets encompassing short time frames, generating doubts about the feasibility of these models in operational settings that deal with the ever-evolving malware threat landscape. Although a limited number of studies have developed concept drift resilient models for handling data drift, they have never considered the impact of different timestamps on the detection solutions. Timestamps are critical to locating the data samples within the historical timeline. Different timestamping approaches may locate samples differently, which, in turn, can significantly impact the performance of the model and, consequently, the adaptive capabilities of the system to concept drift. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking that compares the detection performance of six distinct timestamping approaches for static and dynamic feature sets. Our experiments have demonstrated that timestamp selection is an important decision that has a significant impact on concept drift modeling and the long-term performance of the model regardless of the feature type used for model construction.}

	abstract = {Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are widely considered a useful data source for dynamic malware analysis to understand the behavioral characteristics of malware. However, the accuracy of API-based malware analysis is limited for two reasons. (1) Existing solutions often only consider the API names while ignoring the API arguments, or cannot fully exploit the semantic information from different types of arguments. (2) The relationship between API calls is important to describe the software behavior but is difficult to capture. To overcome the above limitations, we propose DMalNet, a novel malware analysis framework for accurate malware detection and classification. Specifically, we first present a hybrid feature encoder to extract semantic features from API names and arguments. Then, we derive an API call graph from the API call sequence to convert the relationship between API calls into the structural information of the graph. Finally, we design a graph neural network to implement the malware detection and type classification. To evaluate our approach, we use datasets of over 20k benign and 18k malicious samples belonging to 8 malware types. DMalNet achieves 98.43% and 91.42% accuracy on malware detection and malware type classification, respectively. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of API feature engineering and the graph learning model. Further experiments show that DMalNet can effectively detect malware.}

	abstract = {With the emergence of new technologies and the generalized use of social media, corporations have an invested economic interest in employing web-tracking techniques, but there is also the issue of protecting users’ privacy. In this field of research, only few articles introduce methods to evaluate website compliance in the use of current web-tracking techniques. Moreover, evaluating the level of compliance requires, in the majority of cases, manually implementing an extensive data analysis. In this paper, we present four new algorithms (CIA, CDA, BDA, and SCA) and a novel measure (WLoC) to evaluate user tracking compliance in websites and the level of confidence in the use of information-gathering technologies, by employing the recently published Website Evidence Collector (WEC) software from the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). The paper also showcases a case study of the top 500 websites most visited by Alexa in Spain to evaluate the performance of the presented algorithms and metrics. Results reveal a novel procedure for obtaining categorized websites’ compliance and confidence levels of a set of websites under the current European legislation, thus updating and enhancing some of the previous research work.}

While storing as well as facilitating these data for business or individual requirements, data disclosure, sensitive data leakage, and privacy breaches are important concerns to both service providers and service consumers. Many privacy-preserving data publishing models came into existence to protect data security and privacy from disclosure. Background knowledge has been an important data source to the adversary and has become a potential threat to many privacy-preserving data publishing models. Background knowledge allows the adversary to reveal sensitive information of an individual from the published data. In this paper, we formalize background knowledge by defining different knowledge sets. We present a privacy model against the given background knowledge. We analyze the conventional privacy-preserving data publishing models such as\nk\n-anonymity,\nl\n-diversity, and\nt\n-closeness against the background knowledge attacks and show that all these privacy models fail to preserve privacy against the comprehensive background knowledge adversarial model, which we formalized in this work. Comprehensive background knowledge attacks in privacy-preserving data publishing models are practical in many real-world applications, and we believe that the privacy model presented in this work advances the research findings in the area.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of threat that has grabbed the attention of researchers, particularly in the industrial security field. APTs are cyber intrusions carried out by skilled and well-resourced adversaries who target specific information in high-profile organizations and governments, frequently as part of a multi-phase long-term operation. One of the phases of the APT process is the command-and-control (C&C) phase, also known as beaconing. Beaconing is an important part of an APT lifecycle, where the adversaries establish channels with the compromised hosts in the targeted system, allowing them to launch additional attacks. Detecting and predicting this stage is therefore a practical way to guard against APTs. This paper discusses the techniques and methods used to detect APTs and also specifically to identify beaconing, either during the APT lifecycle or not. In it, we determine various artificial intelligence algorithms used for detecting, analyzing and comparing characteristics of datasets and data sources used to implement these detection techniques. Moreover, we present the strengths and challenges of various APT/beaconing detection methods. Finally, this study outlines many cybersecurity vendor projects that have been created to identify APT or beaconing operations, categorized according to the detection approach utilized.}

However, many works have demonstrated that neural network-based object detection is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we study adversarial attacks on object detectors in the real world and propose a new adversarial attack called Misleading Attention and Classification Attack (MACA), which can generate adversarial patches to mislead the object detectors. Specifically, we propose a new scheme to generate adversarial patches to fool the object detector. Our scheme restricts the noise of the adversarial patches and aims to ensure that the generated adversarial patches are visually similar to natural images. The attack simulates the complex external physical environment and the 3D transformations of non-rigid objects to increase the robustness of adversarial patches. We attack the up-to-date object detectors (e.g., Yolo-V5), and we prove that our technique has strong transferability among different detectors. Extensive experiments show that it is feasible to transfer the digital adversarial patches to the real world while maintaining the transferability of adversarial patches among different models and the success rate of adversarial attacks.}

In reality, however, organizations struggle to fully implement EA frameworks because the requirements for implementing an EA and the benefits of commercial frameworks are unclear, and the overhead of maintaining EA artifacts is unacceptable, especially for smaller organizations. In this paper, we describe a novel approach called CAESAR8 (Continuous Agile Enterprise Security Architecture Review in 8 domains) that supports dynamic and holistic reviews of information security risks in IT projects. CAESAR8’s nonlinear design supports continuous reassessment of information security risks, based on a checklist that assesses the maturity of security considerations in eight domains that often cause information security failures. CAESAR8 assessments can be completed by multiple stakeholders independently, thus ensuring consideration of their tacit knowledge while preventing groupthink. Our evaluation with experienced industry professionals showed that CAESAR8 successfully addresses real-world problems in information security risk management, with significant benefits particularly for smaller organizations.}

As a response to the increasingly distributed nature of attacks, many organizations have demonstrated willingness to exchange information concerning threats, incidents, and mitigation strategies with security detection tools and techniques. Various security detection techniques such as signature recognition, anomaly detection, etc fail to completely detect complicated attacks. The current situation can be dealt with as a significant tool that helps auditors and administrators to manage and identify distributed threats. In this paper, a novel social spider communicating behavior-based swarm intelligent open-source Orchestrated Continuous Vulnerability Assessment (OCVA) scanning tool is proposed. The proposed OCVA tool addresses the requirement of orchestration of continuous vulnerability assessment of all automated cybersecurity detection processes. It scans, monitors, visualizes, analyzes, mitigates, and remediates the vulnerabilities of the network, assets, and web applications. It helps the developers and security auditors overcome challenges by providing the desired visualizations and analytics of the vulnerable assets. Two case studies are conducted on the basis of the algorithmic comparative analysis with BRICK, Fuzzing, ACO, PSO and GA based vulnerability scanners along with the tool based comparative evaluation with W3af, ZAP, Wapiti, and Arachni in terms of vulnerability detection rate, accuracy, false positive rate, true positive rate and consistency. The results indicate that the proposed OCVA tool outperforms in terms of accuracy, vulnerability remediation rate, and consistency in both.}

Malware visualization approaches and deep learning techniques have proven effective in classifying sophisticated malware from benchmark datasets. A major problem with traditional deep learning classifier is the need to re-train the classifier when a new malware family emerges. In this paper, we propose few-shot classification techniques which allows us to classify malware based on a few instances and without the need for re-training the classifier for novel malware families. We also propose a novel malware visualization technique that can represent a malware binary as a 3-channel image. We experiment with two distinct few-shot learning architectures namely CSNN (Convolutional Siamese Neural Network) and Shallow-FS (Shallow Few-Shot). CSNN is more suitable when scarce data is available for training, otherwise Shallow-FS can be used to achieve better performance. Our architectures outperforms state of the art few-shot learning approaches and achieves high accuracy in traditional malware classification. Our experiments show our models’ ability to classify recent and novel malware families from just a few instances with high accuracy.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can fool deep models by adding subtle perturbations. Although existing attacks have achieved promising results, it still leaves a long way to go for generating transferable adversarial examples under the black-box setting. To this end, this paper proposes to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, and applies dual-stage feature-level perturbations to an existing model to implicitly create a set of diverse models. Then these models are fused by the longitudinal ensemble during the iterations. The proposed method is termed Dual-Stage Network Erosion (DSNE). We conduct comprehensive experiments both on non-residual and residual networks, and obtain more transferable adversarial examples with the computational cost similar to the state-of-the-art method. In particular, for the residual networks, the transferability of the adversarial examples can be significantly improved by biasing the residual block information to the skip connections. Our work provides new insights into the architectural vulnerability of neural networks and presents new challenges to the robustness of neural networks.}

Instrumentation information plays a significant role in sophisticated greybox fuzzer such as American Fuzzing Lop to directionally improve coverage and distill seeds. While open-source programs leverage wrapped assemblers to glean instrumentation information, closed-source programs can utilize the emulation-based instrumentation for coverage-guided fuzzing. The pervasiveness of the closed source puts a strong demand for emulation instrumentation. However, the required access to peripherals brings great difficulty in fuzzing on the emulator, especially for those various IoT devices. This paper presents AflIot, the first generic on-device fuzzing framework for Linux-based IoT binary programs. By leveraging offset-free binary-level instrumentation, binary programs can avoid unnecessarily rewriting, inherit compatibility of peripherals, and be executed directly on IoT devices by AflIot. We evaluate AflIot  on multiple benchmarks with real-world IoT programs. AflIot  identified 437 unique crashes in 13 binary programs, including 95 newly confirmed unique crashes. Those crashes demonstrate that AflIot  is efficient and effective in detecting potential software bugs in binary programs on Linux-based IoT devices.}

As part of the security analysis, we provide a detailed overview of the O-RAN architecture; present an ontology for evaluating the security of a system that is currently at an early development stage; identify O-RAN’s high-risk areas; enumerate O-RAN’s threat actors; and model potential threats to O-RAN. The significance of this work is in providing an updated attack surface to cellular network operators. Based on the attack surface, cellular network operators can carefully deploy the appropriate countermeasures to improve O-RAN’s security.}

	abstract = {Since personalization was introduced to security nudges, several approaches using the correlations between the General Decision-Making Styles (GDMS) and nudge effects have been proposed. However, the GDMS-based schemes do not apply to real systems well since it is challenging, if not impossible, to obtain the GDMS without psychological scales. Instead, we propose a practical scheme that leverages users’ system-use behaviors to personalize security nudges. To verify the effectiveness of the developed scheme, we analyze the data collected through two between-subjects lab experiments (\nN\n1\n= 312,\nN\n2\n= 696). By comparing the efficacy of the behavior-based and the GDMS-based approaches, we find that the behaviors outperform the GDMS in accurately predicting nudge effects, and more importantly, the behavior-based personalization scheme is comparably effective and more robust in improving nudge effects. This confirms that the behavior-based framework can be a practical and promising solution when implementing personalized nudge schemes to improve security behaviors.}

	abstract = {With the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape, the need for a continuous training for new cybersecurity skill sets is a requirement. Such continuous training programs can be delivered on platforms like cyber ranges. Cyber ranges support training by providing a simulated or emulated representation of a computer network infrastructure, besides additional training and testing services. Cyber attack and defense skills can be gained by attacking and defending a simulated or an emulated infrastructure. However, to provide a realistic training in such infrastructures, there is a need for necessary friction in the environment. Human teams, playing both attackers’ and defenders’ roles, provide this friction. Involving human teams in large-scale cybersecurity exercises is relatively inefficient and not feasible for standardizing training because different teams apply different tactics. Currently, the proposed solutions for cyber range training platforms focus on automating the deployment of the cybersecurity exercise infrastructure but not on the execution part. This leaves a room for improving exercise execution by adding realism and efficiency. This research presents an agent-based system that emulates cyber attack and defense actions during cybersecurity exercise execution; this helps provide realistic and efficient cybersecurity training. To specify agents’ behavior and decision making, a new formal model, called the execution plan (EP), was developed and utilized in this work.}

	abstract = {Cyber insurance presents a compelling value proposition for organizations wanting to reduce risk exposure and recover losses from incidents. However, the adoption rate of cyber insurance outside first-world countries has been relatively low. In this paper we focus on the interesting case of Malaysia – a nation with a low rate of cyber insurance adoption despite its ranking among the top ten countries with the highest level of commitment to cybersecurity. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate the key barriers and enablers to cyber insurance adoption in Malaysia. Following a hybrid approach of deductive and inductive reasoning, we reviewed the literature to identify barriers and enablers to the adoption of cyber insurance. Subsequently, we conducted eight semi-structured interviews with experts from seven Malaysian organizations. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of interviews, we developed a ranked list of twelve barriers and seven enablers to the adoption of cyber insurance. Our study makes two key contributions. First, it contributes to cyber insurance literature by providing the most comprehensive explanation to date for the low rate of cyber insurance adoption in developing countries. Second, our ranked lists provide prioritized guidance to cyber insurance stakeholders (e.g. government, regulatory authorities, insurance providers, and insurance policyholders) on the specific barriers to overcome and enablers to leverage in order to improve the adoption of cyber insurance in Malaysia.}

	abstract = {Code instrumentation is widely used in software analysis. The coverage-guided fuzzers collect path information by instrumenting additional code into the executable to guide the mutator. Existing instrumentation tools try to instrument all basic blocks to achieve high code coverage. This causes additional run-time overhead to the target and slows down the fuzzing. Also, too many paths may lead to a hash collision, or distract the attention of the fuzzer to less important code. To pay more attention to the instrumented code and place the instrumentation points into the functional areas of interest or security-related basic blocks, this paper presents MinSIB (Minimized static instrumentation for fuzzing binaries), a static binary instrumentation toolkit for Windows binaries. It instruments additional code into the executable by inline mode to reduce the additional overhead caused by instrumentation. Meanwhile, three optimization approaches are adopted to minimize the number of instrumentation points. Based on this, MinSIB reduces the number of instrumentation points by 90% on average, and the run-time overhead is 79% less than that of full instrumentation. Also, MinSIB improves the efficiency of fuzzing by reproducing known vulnerabilities 4 to 24 times faster than the existing tools, and 14 unknown bugs are found from 6 real-world programs. The results indicate that MinSIB outperforms the state-of-the-art static binary instrumentation tool (PE-AFL) and dynamic instrumentation tool (DynamoRIO) for Windows PE files.}

In recent applications, it is a challenging task to maintain the trust between various linked devices for the growth and creation of IoT systems. Therefore, this paper presents a separation architecture based on the Quality of Services by managing the trust between the IoT devices. The proposed model is novel based on the selection of the attribute set against the separated class. The training and classification are done by using the ontology architecture. The data architecture is processed by a k-means algorithm for the generation of the class labels into three different groups. The groups have been labeled using a Fuzzy logic inference engine and a Genetic Algorithm has been used for optimization. The performance measure has been evaluated using multiple multiclass classifiers for accuracy, True Positive Rate, (TPR), and False Positive Rate (FPR).The simulation results elucidate that accuracy of the proposed technique is improved by 10.7%, FPR by 6%, and TPR by 11% in comparison to state of art techniques.}

	abstract = {Due to the high dependency of traditional intrusion detection method on a fully-labeled large dataset, existing works can hardly be applied in real-world scenarios, especially facing zero-day attacks. In this paper we present a novel intrusion detection framework called “FS-IDS”, including flow data encoding method, feature fusion mechanism and architecture of intrusion detection system based on few-shot learning. We utilize task generator to split the dataset into separate tasks and train model in an episodic way, hoping model to learn general knowledge rather than those specific to a single class. The extraction module and distance metric module are responsible for learning and determining whether the traffic data are benign or not. We conduct three sets of experiments on “FS-IDS”, i.e., comparison study, ablation study and multiclass study. Comparison study firstly determines that the best measure metric for discrimination is Euclidean distance. Based on the optimal implementation, “FS-IDS” achieves comparable performance with existing works by using much fewer malicious samples. Ablation study sets two base models to explore how proposed encoding method and feature fusion mechanism improve detection capacity. Both the image representation and feature fusion achieve more than 2% improvement in accuracy and recall. Finally, to test whether “FS-IDS” can perform well under real-world scenario or not, we design network traffic containing various attacks to simulate complex malicious network environment. Experimental results show that “FS-IDS” maintains more than 90% detection accuracy and recall under the worst circumstances, which composes of various seen or unseen attacks with only a few malicious samples available.}

Because of the importance of DCs, security to protect a DC from external threats and attacks is an issue to be addressed. However, the conflicted nature of the evaluation criteria (such as infrastructure, energy, natural, business, political, and legal risks) makes it difficult to assess the countries’ profiles. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic evaluation methodology using two different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches, namely spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution). While SF-AHP is preferred to prioritize the main and sub-criteria under imprecise decision making environment, EDAS is used to rank the countries’ DC profiles embedding the obtained criteria weights. The results of the methods have been compared with the ranking results presented in the report called as Data Centre Security Index (DCSI) is published by Technology Research Project Corporate (TRPC). Consequently, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand rank in the top three due to their high electrification rates and secure internet servers.}

	abstract = {Recently, neural networks (NNs) have been proposed for the detection of cyber attacks targeting industrial control systems (ICSs). Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system operation, to cope with the evolution of the monitored signals over time. However, by exploiting this mechanism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector to allow cyber attacks to stay undetected at test time. Previous work explored the ability to generate adversarial samples that fool anomaly detection models in ICSs but without compromising their training process. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online detectors based on neural networks. We propose two distinct attack algorithms, namely, interpolation- and back-gradient-based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness. The evaluation is conducted on diverse data sources: synthetic data, real-world ICS testbed data, and a simulation of the Tennessee Eastman process. This first practical evaluation of poisoning attacks using a simulation tool highlights the challenges of poisoning dynamically controlled systems. The generality of the proposed methods under different NN parameters and architectures is studied. Lastly, we propose and analyze some potential mitigation strategies.}

Although methods have been proposed to resolve the privacy and fairness issues separately, simultaneous protection methods are merely studied. In this study, for facial attributes classifications, we propose one unified framework with GAN models to generate synthetic images for privacy protections and contrastive learning based loss designs to enforce fairness protections simultaneously. Meanwhile, unlike other privacy or fairness protection methods, the proposed methods can maintain high data and model utilities. We evaluate our approaches with the high image resolution dataset CelebA-HD, and the results show our methods meet both privacy and fairness requirements.}

As contradictory demands (e.g., tensions in digital organizations) intensify, organizations increasingly find it difficult to implement digital security governance (DSG) as part of their regular organizational change activities. Based on data from forty-two interviews with Dutch CISOs and CIOs of large organizations that are active in various sectors, we identify three key paradoxical tensions that affect DSG implementation. We found that in a digital context, paradoxical tensions are pressurized and become out of balance. Disbalance among tensions exposes friction that hinders the implementation of DSG mechanisms. Finally, we present a conceptual model that sets direction for ambidextrous digital security.

With the absence of a driver, such mini-busses process the sensors’ inputs and exchanged data with other vehicles and intelligent transport systems to achieve a real time assimilation of its surroundings. Consequently, the technologies supporting the driverless functionalities ushered new cybersecurity risks and data privacy breaches. Unfortunately, several studies mostly focus on individual Connected-Automated Vehicles (CAV), though intrinsic underpinnings of the ACS’s threat vectors remain unexplored. In the present paper, we considerably extend that investigation by proposing a comprehensive state of the art with farsighted analyses addressing security threats and data privacy concerns from both technical and legal perspectives to thwart potential attacks. Moreover, as existing approaches have not provided yet a clear road map about ACS’s security standards, the present work sheds light on recent and up to date standards and standardisation bodies dealing with cybersecurity and privacy issues in the automated driving ecosystem. This paper presents an analysis debating the trade-off between maximising the ACS benefits and minimising the associated security vulnerabilities and attacks through an overview of technical and legal mitigation strategies.}

	abstract = {Given the ever-increasing number of malware variants, detecting malware families is crucial. However, the operand semantics of assembly instructions are strongly related to the operating environment and are difficult to extract. This leads to the lack of instruction semantics and the difficulty in correctly classifying malware variants. At the same time, previous research does not mine the internal structural features of the instructions and the contextual relationships between them. This makes it difficult to efficiently identify virus variants. With this as motivation, this article presents a malware family classification method called EII-MBS (enhanced instruction-level behavior semantics learning). By abstracting the types of operands, the semantics of the operands are separated from the constraints of the operating environment. After this, the structure, relationship, and context information of the instructions are fully mined and these three aspects of instruction behavior semantics are embedded into a vector representation for the subsequent building of malware feature images. Furthermore, our method creates channel attention for capturing important features. In addition to the widely used Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset, we take the lead in conducting experiments on the recently made available BODMAS dataset. The average accuracy rates of EII-MBS are 99.40% and 99.26% on the two datasets, respectively. Further experiments on different proportions of training datasets and testing datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art malware family classification performance.}

	abstract = {The increase in the number of connected devices to the Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) development accompanied a massive increase in the number and types of attacks. Most IoT devices have security vulnerabilities due to their limited computing and storage capabilities and specific protocols. Thus, there is essential to build Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can detect these threats that affect smart applications. Researchers examined different data mining techniques, statistical analysis techniques, and machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building an anomaly-based intrusion detection system based on using a non-linear statistical analysis technique called recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Our approach uses RQA to identify abnormal behavior in an individual feature extracted from a series of packets rather than inspecting the packet's payload. The proposed procedure implies finding the minimum number of features, applying the RQA technique to each effective feature separately, and applying different ML algorithms to classify the RQA measurements resulting from each effective feature. The system's performance was evaluated based on the accuracy and F-score using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Results show our proposed approach's effectiveness in discovering hidden characteristics in the underlying series of an individual feature that leads to identifying different attacks. Besides, the proposed approach outperforms most previous works using one feature.}

	abstract = {As applications of machine learning become increasingly widespread, the need to ensure model accuracy and fairness while protecting the privacy of user data becomes more pronounced. On this note, this paper introduces a federated learning training model, which allow clients to simultaneously learn their model and update the associated parameters on a centralized server. In our approach, we seek to achieve an acceptable trade-off between privacy, accuracy, and model fairness by using differential privacy (DP), which also helps to minimize privacy risks by protecting the presence of a specific sample in the training data. Machine learning models can, however, exhibit unintended behaviors, such as unfairness, which result in groups with certain sensitive characteristics (e.g., gender) receiving different patterns of outcomes. Hence, we discuss the fairness and privacy effect of local DP and global DP when applied to federated learning by designing a fair and privacy quantification mechanism. In doing so, we can achieve an acceptable trade-off between accuracy, privacy, and model fairness. We quantify the level of fairness based on the constraints of three definitions of fairness, including demographic parity, equal odds, and equality of opportunity. Finally, findings from our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets with class imbalance demonstrate the positive effect of local and global DP on fairness. Our study also shows that privacy can come at the cost of fairness, as stricter privacy can intensify discrimination. Hence, we posit that careful parameter selection can potentially help achieve a more effective trade-off between utility, bias, and privacy.}

	abstract = {The intrusion detection system (IDS) is the first and the most significant shield in Internet security. Nevertheless, with regard to confronting unknown attacks, such as zero-day attacks, it is difficult for IDS to detect and respond. To address this issue, we have designed a brand-new IDS framework to detect vague attacks and learn new types of attack more effectively based on the collaborative neural network (CoNN-IDS). The framework consists of an unknown attack detection (UAD) module and a malicious behavior parsing (MBP) module, where the autoencoder and the deep neural network serve as the UAD module and the MBP module, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregation strategy based on the DBSCAN algorithm and group decision system is employed to retrain the IDS for long term use. In particular, an agile training mechanism is introduced to enhance the efficiency of our model by retraining low-impact neuron. The experiments have been simulated with two individual datasets to reveal that the new method has a higher accuracy in unknown attack detection and shorter time spent on the retraining phase, which collectively evidence its advancement compared with the general IDS system.}

	abstract = {Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a ‘Never Trust, Always Verify’ concept to improve cybersecurity by eliminating trust and validating network requests continuously. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is here to replace Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and provide solitary access to applications and data. The growth of ZTA has spiked over the years, but organizations are reluctant to invest in the security approach. Previous research studies cover ways to implement or migrate to ZTA, its significance, and challenges but provide limited information on available tools, prices, and the success rate of ZTA. Organizations lack information on the quantitative evaluations of ZTA benefits and drawbacks. An in-depth evaluation of ZTA to help security researchers better understand the costs and benefits of employing this new technology as a defence against cyber attacks is provided in this work. Results show that the implementation of ZTA causes a reduction of $684K on average in risk impact over a span of four years for small to medium sized organizations and enterprise-level organizations.}

	abstract = {The globalisation and outsourcing of the IC supply chain have led to a more complex production cycle. Using threat models to understand the attacks can help engineers build stronger countermeasures and evaluate against different options to create better protection from attacks. Gamification is an alternative to teaching engineers threats using threat models and trying to keep up to date with new threats. Playing a serious game based on the IC hardware supply chain allows players to take control of self-learning and build knowledge through experiences in the gameplay. This paper propose CIST: A serious game for hardware supply chain, designed for hardware security and uses a threat model called CIST, designed to overcome the different requirements for hardware threats and gaps in current generic security threat models. The CIST game covers hardware-related risks through the complete IC life cycle from design, manufacturing, using the IC within a system and finally, recycling the ICs.}
