	abstract = {The wide adoption of encrypted traffic brings challenges to network management. Previous studies propose different approaches to tackle this problem. However, most of them still struggle to strike a balance in three dimensions, interpretability, robustness and efficiency. As countermeasures, we propose using a hierarchical feature approach to enhance the comprehensiveness behavior description of network behavior to achieve the balance of the three points. Instead of aggregating under-layer features, we have employed the collector mechanism to directly generate the hierarchical features. This approach can overcome the issue of inaccurate feature generation caused by multiple concurrent session flows. To measure the generalization ability persuasively, six datasets are reorganized to simulate the scenario with unknown applications. Besides, different statistical models are applied with state-of-the-art features to conduct experiments. Experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve the F1 score above 98% on the reorganized sets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical approach.}

To bridge the research gap, we identified 28 common personal information types requested by e-commerce services and investigated Chinese consumers based on an online questionnaire about their information sensitivity to disclosing these personal information types to e-commerce platforms and their concerns for information privacy when accessing e-commerce services. Rooted in information sensitivity literature and multidimensional development theory, we further explored the impacts of consumer individual factors and e-commerce situational factors on information sensitivity, as well as the impact of information sensitivity on e-commerce privacy concerns. Results suggest that personal information types related to personal identity and digital payments are considered the most sensitive in e-commerce services, and consumers have a consensus on which personal information types are more sensitive. Results suggest that both individual factors, such as privacy experience, and situational factors, such as website social presence and perceived privacy control, affect information sensitivity perceptions. Perceived information sensitivity of medium-sensitive and high-sensitive personal information types affect e-commerce privacy concerns, and information sensitivity can mediate the impacts of individual factors and situational factors on e-commerce privacy concerns. Our research helps deepen the understanding of information sensitivity and information privacy concerns and provides practical insights for privacy policymakers and e-commerce service managers.}

In this paper, we identify five significant unresolved challenges neglected by the specialized research that prevent the qualification of Android malware detection as a solved problem. From methodological flaws to invalid postulates and data set limitations, these challenges, which are thoroughly described throughout the paper, hamper effective, long-term machine learning based Android malware detection.

A large healthcare organization contacted the authors to share that they continued to struggle with the efficacy of their traditional training program and to ask whether we could design a better program. Using an action research methodology, we designed a new training program using self-regulation theory. We tested this new training with an experiment using a sample of 307 medical and administrative staff. The results of chi-square tests comparing the click rate of phishing emails before and after the training showed that the new SETA program was more effective than the existing SETA program (overall medical staff χ2 = 4.87, p < 0.05; overall administrative staff χ2 = 16.04, p < 0.05). The results also showed differences between medical and office staff regarding the effectiveness of training. The research shows the effectiveness of self-regulatory theory in SETA training and how this approach leads to significant improvement vs traditional methods of training.

	abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a pivotal technique widely utilized in the realms of machine learning and data analysis. It aims to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while minimizing the loss of information. In recent years, there have been endeavors to utilize homomorphic encryption in privacy-preserving PCA algorithms for secure cloud computing. These approaches commonly employ a PCA routine known as PowerMethod, which takes the covariance matrix as input and generates an approximate eigenvector corresponding to the primary component of the dataset. However, their performance is constrained by the absence of an efficient homomorphic covariance matrix computation circuit and an accurate homomorphic vector normalization strategy in the PowerMethod algorithm. In this study, we propose a novel approach to privacy-preserving PCA that addresses these limitations, resulting in superior efficiency, accuracy, and scalability compared to previous approaches.}

	abstract = {As a service for the public, the issue of location leakage in spatial crowdsourcing has attracted extensive attention from researchers and institutions in recent years. Facing this challenge, several encryption-based schemes have been proposed to protect participants' location information from untrusted cloud servers. However, these schemes mainly target insider threats but ignore the collusion problem between dishonest users and cloud servers. In this paper, we define the problem of Brute-Force Attack under collusion between dishonest users and cloud servers and find that there is no solution that can both guarantee efficient task assignment and address this attack. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual cloud server privacy-preserving scheme. First, utilizing the GeoHash encoding algorithm, we design a grid-based index tree structure and a task assignment method called Locate-then-Find to achieve faster-than-linear assignment efficiency. Considering that traditional system models fail to address the problem of Brute-Force Attack while ensuring efficiency, we then design a dual cloud server system model, and propose a multi-user Two-Step Location Encryption scheme to protect participants' locations. In our model, both high efficiency and high security are promised. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model and resistant to the Brute-Force Attack. In the experimental analysis, we first evaluate the resistance of existing grid-based schemes against the Brute-Force Attack, and subsequently demonstrate the performance of our scheme on a real-world dataset. The final comparison experiments show that our scheme exhibits superior performance under the same security conditions.}

	abstract = {In the contemporary digital landscape, the escalating threat landscape of cyber attacks, particularly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, has become a paramount concern for network security. This research introduces an innovative approach to DDoS detection leveraging a deep neural network (DNN) architecture rooted in deep learning (DL) principles. The proposed model exhibits a scalable and adaptable framework, enabling meticulous analysis of network traffic data to discern intricate patterns indicative of DDoS attacks. To validate the efficacy of our methodology, rigorous evaluations were conducted using authentic real-world traffic data. The results unequivocally establish the superiority of our DNN-based approach over traditional DDoS detection techniques. This research holds significant promise for bolstering network security, particularly within the dynamic landscape of software-defined network (SDN) environments. The study's findings contribute to the continual refinement and eventual deployment of advanced measures in fortifying digital infrastructure against the evolving threat landscape. Performance metrics, including detection accuracy and loss rates, further emphasize the effectiveness of our approach across different datasets. With detection accuracy rates of 99.98%, 100%, and 99.99% for the InSDN, CICIDS2018, and Kaggle DDoS datasets, respectively, coupled with low loss rates, our DNN-based model demonstrates robust capabilities in mitigating contemporary DDoS threats. This study not only presents a novel DDoS detection approach within SDN infrastructures but also offers insights into practical implications and challenges associated with deploying DNNs in real-world SDN environments. Network security professionals can benefit from the nuanced perspectives provided, contributing to the ongoing discourse on fortifying digital networks against evolving cyber threats.}

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense is a profound research problem. In recent years, adversaries tend to complicate their attack strategies by crafting vast DDoS variants. On the one hand, this trend exacerbates both extremes of classification granularity (i.e., binary and attack level) in existing machine learning methods. On the other hand, massive attack categories make the filter rule table bulky, as well as cause problems of slow reaction presented in the recent state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation system. Therefore, we propose the concept of a DDoS family to reconcile/cope with these issues. The specific technical roadmap includes traffic pattern characterization, attack fingerprint production, and cross-executed family partition by community detection. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposal in terms of portraying similarities, guiding model classification/unknown attack detection, optimizing defense strategies, and speeding filtering reactions. For instance, our results show that using only one rule can defend 15 types of attacks due to their homogeneous behavioral representation. Particularly, we find the interesting observation that counting the backward packet is more efficient and robust against some attacks (e.g., Tor's Hammer Attack), which is very different from previous solutions.}

	abstract = {With the increasing importance of internal information security, detecting insider threats has become a critical issue to safeguard organizations' information systems. However, most of the previous studies either overlook temporal relationships or have difficulty attaining accurate performance. One of the primary factors contributing to this challenge is their approach, which lacks a holistic perspective. To our knowledge, none of these studies has considered the integration of statistical and sequential information in addressing this issue. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for insider threat detection based on statistical and sequential analysis to address this challenge. Leveraging the strengths of both statistical analysis and sequential analysis, we deploy an efficient implementation for analyzing and modeling user data based on convolutional attention and a transformer encoder, referred to as CATE. First, user behavior logs are consolidated from diverse sources and preprocessed into a suitable format for subsequent analysis. Then, two parallel analysis modules analyze user data in two different dimensions. The analysis modules are entirely constructed using a neural network for its high adaptability and efficient integration of information from distinct dimensions. Specifically, a subnetwork structure based on convolutional attention is designed to effectively learn statistical information, while a separate subnetwork structure based on transformers is tailored for learning sequential information. Finally, we perform a series of solid experiments utilizing the publicly available CERT dataset to evaluate our framework's effectiveness and robustness in detecting insider threats and identifying malicious scenarios.}

There is little knowledge about the role of efficiency (i.e., task completion time) in the perception of 2FA. This paper aims to understand how objective and subjective efficiency influence the usability and security perception of two token-based authentication methods. We conducted a user study with 337 smartphone users aged 26–81. Participants worked with two token-based authentication methods: a near-field communication (NFC) token and a payment card with a card reader. Path analysis showed that task completion time is predicted by age, gender, and the length of smartphone and e-banking use. Participants who were satisfied with application aesthetics were also satisfied with the time it took them to complete the tasks. For the NFC token, men were more satisfied with their task completion time. In the case of the card reader, participants who were more satisfied with their efficiency were also more satisfied with the method and perceived it as more secure. Our results indicate that satisfaction with the time spent on the authentication task is more important for a positive perception of the authentication methods than the objective completion time. Despite the potential time consumption of the 2FA methods, users might be satisfied with the methods in terms of usability and security, especially for highly valued accounts.}

IDN homograph takes advantage of some characters in different native languages in internationalized domain names that look similar to legitimate ones. Although researchers have proposed several enlightening detection methods, most of them focused on detecting typosquatting domain names. The ones focused on IDN homograph attack detection either need to enhance the generalization ability or improve detection performance caused by data imbalance. In this paper, we devised a Generative Adversarial Network with a Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem. We transform domain names into images and calculate their similarity by Siamese neural networks. Our work can identify whether a domain name is IDN homograph or not effectively. We use the dataset generated based on Unicode tables, publicly available homograph tools, and the Internet traffic captured from the China Education Research Network backbone (CERNET) to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and reduces the false positive rate in detecting homograph domain names. In addition, it can also accurately identify typosquatting in phishing pages.}

	abstract = {Ransomware attacks have evolved with criminals using double extortion schemes, where they signal data exfiltration to inflate ransom demands. This development is further complicated by information asymmetry, where victims are compelled to respond to ambiguous and often deceptive signals from attackers. This study explores the complex interactions between criminals and victims during ransomware attacks, especially focusing on how data exfiltration is communicated. We use a signaling game to understand the strategies both parties use when dealing with uncertain information. We identify five distinct equilibria, each characterized by the criminals' varied approaches to signaling data exfiltration, influenced by the strategic parameters inherent in each attack scenario. Calibrating the game parameters with real-world like values, we identify the most probable equilibrium, offering insights into anticipated ransom amounts and corresponding payoffs for both victims and criminals. Our findings suggest criminals are likely to claim data exfiltration, true or not, highlighting a strategic advantage for intensifying attack efforts. The study underscores the need for victims' caution towards criminals' claims and highlights the unintended consequences of policies making false claims costlier for criminals.}
