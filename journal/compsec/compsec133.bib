	abstract = {Deterrence theory is one of the most commonly used theories to study information security policy non-compliance behavior. However, the results of studies in the information security field are ambiguous. To further address this heterogeneity, various influencing factors have been considered in the context of deterrence theory. However, a current challenge with these findings is that recent studies that quantitatively assess the effectiveness of deterrence have relied predominantly on methods that analyze the underlying data, starting from a regression-based approach. By applying quantile regression, we estimate the overall effect of deterrents, and uncover how their effect differs among employees with different inclinations toward ISP compliance behavior – a critical insight for determining security measures for specific employee groups. Based on longitudinal data gathered in the U.S., our findings show significantly different effects in the analyzed quantiles for both aspects of sanctions, namely certainty and severity.}

	abstract = {The widespread use of email communication for sharing personal, professional, and financial data has rendered it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Detecting untrustworthy emails with minimal errors is crucial to counter these threats. This research paper focuses on classifying spam and phishing emails, commonly employed to steal confidential information by impersonating legitimate sources. The scale of such attacks is alarmingly high, causing substantial financial losses across sectors like banking, healthcare, technology, and other businesses. This research aims to classify both spam and phishing emails, addressing the limitations of existing studies that only focus on one type and consider either the email body or content for feature selection. This research incorporates features from both the email body and content during model training. The authors propose a novel approach that ensures highly accurate classification while effectively handling the common issue of data imbalance in email phishing and spam classification. The approach utilizes a dual-layer architecture, with each layer containing a trained or pre-trained model that classifies data instances into their respective classes. Layer 1 classifies the phishing class, while Layer 2 classifies the spam class. Building upon the proven effectiveness of deep learning techniques for text classification and analysis, the proposed architecture employs models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Experimental evaluation demonstrates the approach’s remarkable accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, achieving 99.51%, 99.68%, 99.5%, and 99.52%, respectively. This signifies its high efficacy in detecting and classifying malicious emails with minimal errors, thus holding great promise in enhancing system security against cyber-attacks in email communication.}

Using survey data from Israeli firms about their cyber defenses, we overcome the endogeneity obstacle using an instrumental variable (IV) drawn from questions about a cybersecurity directive. The resulting regressions examine the causal relationship between security precautions potentially undertaken by enterprises and the likelihood of experiencing a cyber incident. Once suitably instrumented and controlling for characteristics that make some firms more attractive attack targets than others, we find robust evidence that increased adoption of security controls does in fact reduce the likelihood of being breached.}

	abstract = {The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) lies in the core of Industry 4.0, accelerating the convergence of formerly barricaded operational technology systems with modern information technology ones. Nevertheless, the increased connectivity in terms of both wired and wireless links and associated attack surfaces that comes along, requires higher security for safeguarding critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyberattacks. In this rapidly evolving ecosystem, security testbeds have emerged as a versatile, cost-effective solution for investigating potential attack vectors and devising appropriate countermeasures, without putting the real system at risk. The present work seeks to address a prominent literature gap, namely, the lack of a systematic review regarding the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS. We contribute an overarching, manifold review on this topic from 2016 onward, examining the various literature works from diverse angles, namely, the wireless technologies used, the implemented attacks, the employed security controls, and more. The analysis is done on a per-sector basis, including water and wastewater systems, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, energy, maritime, unmanned aircraft systems, and others. Finally yet importantly, we discuss key takeaways, open issues, and challenges. The key observations of our analysis, including almost 50 articles, can be wrapped up into two salient points: on the one hand, wireless technologies are increasingly penetrating into the CPS domain as an orthogonal, versatile solution to their wired counterparts, but on the other, they widen the window of opportunity for threat actors targeting wireless links. In this context, testbed thoroughness and security as a trade-off seem to be of major importance, alongside a modular, possibly sector-neutral reference architecture that overarches the peculiarities of CPS. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-fledged survey on the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS, and it is therefore anticipated to serve as a groundwork and touchstone for several stakeholders at different levels.}

	abstract = {Security issues are threatened in various types of networks, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment that requires early detection. IoT is the network of real-time devices like home automation systems and can be controlled by open-source android devices, which can be an open ground for attackers. Attackers can access the network credentials, initiate a different kind of security breach, and compromises network control. Therefore, timely detecting the increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks is the challenge to ensure the credibility of network protection. In this regard, we have developed a new malware detection framework, Deep Squeezed-Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DSBEL), comprised of novel Squeezed-Boosted Boundary-Region Split-Transform-Merge (SB-BR-STM) CNN and ensemble learning. The proposed STM block employs multi-path dilated convolutional, Boundary, and regional operations to capture the homogenous and heterogeneous global malicious patterns. Moreover, diverse feature maps are achieved using transfer learning and multi-path-based squeezing and boosting at initial and final levels to learn minute pattern variations. Finally, the boosted discriminative features are extracted from the developed deep SB-BR-STM CNN and provided to the ensemble classifiers (SVM, MLP, and AdabooSTM1) to improve the hybrid learning generalization. The performance analysis of the proposed DSBEL framework and SB-BR-STM CNN against the existing techniques have been evaluated by the IOT_Malware dataset on standard performance measures. Evaluation results show progressive performance as 98.50% accuracy, 97.12% F1-Score, 91.91% MCC, 95.97 % Recall, and 98.42 % Precision. The proposed malware analysis framework is robust and helpful for the timely detection of malicious activity and suggests future strategies.}

	abstract = {The application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for monitoring cyberattacks in Internet of Things (IoT) systems has gained significant attention in recent years. However, achieving optimal detection performance through DNN training has posed challenges due to computational intensity and vulnerability to adversarial samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization method that combines regularization and simulated micro-batching. This approach enables the training of DNNs in a robust, efficient, and resource-friendly manner for IoT security monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DNN model, including its performance in Federated Learning (FL) settings, exhibits improved attack detection and resistance to adversarial perturbations compared to benchmark baseline models and conventional Machine Learning (ML) methods typically employed in IoT security monitoring. Notably, the proposed method achieves significant reductions of 79.54% and 21.91% in memory and time usage, respectively, when compared to the benchmark baseline in simulated virtual worker environments. Moreover, in realistic testbed scenarios, the proposed method reduces memory footprint by 6.05% and execution time by 15.84%, while maintaining accuracy levels that are superior or comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method for enhancing the efficiency and robustness of DNN-based IoT security monitoring.}

We conducted a large-scale systematic investigation by assessing IoT firmware and follow-up survey with professionals involved in IoT-device manufacturing to understand the factors that prevent software security of IoT devices. Consequently, we discovered that many IoT devices continue to use old processor architecture and operating systems that are unable to efficiently use existing attack-mitigation features. Furthermore, we demonstrated that software patches are sometimes implicitly applied without changing the software version number (implicit patching); this may generate false positives in existing vulnerability assessments relying on software versions. On the basis of a follow-up survey, we determined technical and contractual constraints to IoT security emanating from the supply chain in the IoT device manufacturing industry. Based on the results, we discuss challenges associated with secure IoT manufacturing in the IoT-device supply chain.}

To address this concern, this paper proposes a new cybersecurity analysis framework that complies with the ISO/SAE 21434:2021 standard. The framework uses the Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privileges (STRIDE) threat model, the Attack Tree Analysis (ATA) approach, and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) as a key score exploitation matrix to rate identified potential threats. To evaluate, the framework was applied, to real-life scenarios, to examine the possible cyber threats in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). To assess, a tool was implemented to automate threat impact ratings, according to safety, operational, financial, privacy, and legislative metrics. It also automates attack feasibility ratings considering attack vectors, complexity, authentication, and risk level identification based on a five-by-five risk matrix. As a result, 199 potential threats were identified and addressed in, four targeted, ADAS-related use cases. For the Lane-Keeping safety-critical use case, as an example, five security requirements were elicited as countermeasures. These results show that ADAS in modern vehicles are vulnerable to cyberattacks.}

This framework consists of three distinct stages: Forensic Readiness, Acquisition, and Investigation. The aim of this study is to offer investigators a standardized methodology for conducting cryptocurrency investigations. To assess the validity of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments using three well-known cryptocurrency wallets. The results of these experiments indicate that the proposed framework holds significant potential as a general framework for cryptocurrency forensics.}

	abstract = {Embedded devices are increasingly present in our everyday life. They often process critical information, and hence, rely on cryptographic protocols to achieve security. However, embedded devices remain particularly vulnerable to attackers seeking to hijack their operation and extract sensitive information by exploiting side channels and code reuse. Code-Reuse Attack (CRAs) can steer the execution of a program to malicious outcomes, altering existing on-board code without direct access to the device memory. Moreover, Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) may reveal secret information to the attacker based on mere observation of the device. Thwarting CRAs and SCAs against embedded devices is especially challenging because embedded devices are usually resource constrained. Fine-grained code diversification can hinder CRAs by introducing uncertainty to the binary code; while software mechanisms can thwart timing or power SCAs. The resilience to either attack may come at the price of the overall efficiency. Moreover, a unified approach that preserves these mitigations against both CRAs and SCAs is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel SecDivCon approach that tackles this challenge. SecDivCon is a combinatorial compiler-based approach that combines software diversification against CRAs with software mitigations against SCAs. SecDivCon restricts the performance overhead introduced by the generated code that thwarts the attacks and hence, offers a secure-by-design approach enabling control over the performance-security trade-off. Our experiments, using 16 benchmark programs, show that SCA-aware diversification is effective against CRAs, while preserving SCA mitigation properties at a low, controllable overhead. Given the combinatorial nature of our approach, SecDivCon is suitable for small, performance-critical functions that are sensitive to SCAs. SecDivCon may be used as a building block to whole-program code diversification or in a re-randomization scheme of cryptographic code.}

	abstract = {The use of cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques in Federated Learning (FL) inadvertently induces a security dilemma because tampered local model parameters are encrypted and thus prevented from auditing. This work firstly demonstrates the triviality of performing model corruption attacks against privacy-preserving FL. We consider the scenario where the model updates are quantized to reduce the communication overhead, whilst the adversary can simply provide local parameters out of a legitimate range to corrupt the model. We then propose MUD-PQFed, a protocol that can precisely detect malicious attacks and enforce fair penalties on malicious clients. By deleting the contributions from the detected malicious clients, the global model utility is preserved as compared to the baseline global model in the absence of the corruption attack. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA benchmark datasets validate the efficacy in terms of retaining the baseline accuracy and effectiveness in terms of detecting malicious clients in a fine-grained manner.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of attacks on On-line Social Networks (OSNs) has imposed particular attention by providers and users. This has an even higher importance for Social Reviewing Systems (SRSs), where users can be strongly conditioned by means of malevolent reviews and behavior of fake or camouflage accounts. There is a rich literature on the use of strong authentication means, encryption or privacy-preserving schemes for OSNs and SRSs, but these mechanisms only represent a first defense line. Advanced attacks may be able to bypass such a defense and to successfully threaten the system and harm its users. Therefore, it is needed to embed a second defence line to peculiar attack scenarios of SRSs that take advantage of user dynamics occurring within social networks. This survey focuses on the issue and solutions to detect malicious reviews and users so as to exclude them from social networks, protect legitimate and honest users and keep the credibility of the protected SRS as high as possible. Therefore, we provide an evaluation of the main detection solutions for the mentioned specific attacks against SRSs in according to different metrics on several standard datasets.}

	abstract = {Masculine tropes are ingrained in cyber-security discourse, as with other forms of security. Such language perpetuates concepts and paradigms that regulate the identities of those involved in cyber-security practice. Further, it may serve to exclude those for whom such identities are not desirable. Through a qualitative study of 18 commercial businesses, utilising data gained from semi-structured interviews of CISOs and senior organisational leaders as well as analysis of company documentation, this study provides empirical data that demonstrates the use of masculine language and concepts in cyber-security practice, which is discussed and deconstructed through a lens of identity work. In so doing, this paper identifies such language as being both regulatory and exclusionary. We introduce the term cyber masculinity to refer to the dominance of these masculine concepts and propose future research directions that can challenge this dominance and achieve a de-masculinization of the field.}

The use of code obfuscation techniques by malicious actors is gaining popularity, further complicating the process of detection. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight obfuscated-malware detector based on machine learning that is also explainable. The proposed method, based on extreme gradient boost, employs only five features extracted from memory dumps, achieving a detection accuracy of over 99%. These five features were selected using recursive feature elimination, based on feature importance. Through testing, we demonstrated that the system was capable of detecting malware instances in just 0.413 μs. The model was explained using Shapley additive explanations.}

	abstract = {Cybersecurity incidents do represent a serious danger for companies. In fact, the number of cyber crimes is exponentially growing in a scenario where the global COVID-19 pandemic determined several conditions that have negatively affected companies' cyber-security posture. The adoption of risk management processes can help reduce security threats and mitigate both financial and reputation losses. In computer systems, it is crucial to relate security risks to the system infrastructure. Bayesian attack graph models can help reach such a goal. The approach is very effective as it allows to define the attack paths an attacker would perform against a specific network infrastructure. In this way, it is possible to construct a truthful representation of a company's security risks that cannot be obtained with other approaches. Still, Bayesian risk management approaches are usually based on advanced threats. Namely, those threats relate to vulnerabilities that can only be exploited by a skilled attacker. Although several works enrich the expressiveness of the proposed Bayesian model, current proposals do not provide insights into how it is possible to estimate security control costs, asset values, and threat probabilities for other types of threats. Furthermore, they do not take insider threats into consideration. This work shows that a risk management framework based on Bayesian Attack Graphs can be adapted to include a variety of threats, including those related to the insiders. We first extend an interesting work based on Bayesian Decision Networks to cover a broader range of threats. Then, we formalize several concepts, such as security control coverage and risk strategy, and show that our model can easily integrate insider threats when specific properties are defined. Finally, in order to address insider threats, we enrich the model with security controls that differ from the standard ones, such as technical IT training sessions and employee satisfaction surveys.}

	abstract = {Adversarial distillation (AD) which combines adversarial training with knowledge distillation has become a powerful procedure to mitigate the effects of adversarial examples to deep neural networks, which aims at distilling a robust student network from a pre-trained robust teacher network. In AD, the teacher's reliability has been a crucial problem and recent work incorporates a self-distillation loss on the student into the AD framework, encouraging the student to partially trust the teacher and gradually trust itself more. However, the only key factor to control this trust level cannot be adaptive enough for different training samples, guiding the student to trust itself inappropriately and inspiring us to pursue a better way to obtain more reliable supervision. In this paper we revisit the performance variation of all training samples from the teacher to student, showing that previous work is not always adaptive with the distillation and can be further refined. Accordingly, a more effective and justified supervision, namely Curricular Adversarial Distillation (CAD), is proposed to help boost the self-distillation process. In CAD, the KL divergences between both the clean and adversarial outputs of teacher and the smoothed labels are calculated for the supervision to address the teacher's unreliability in the self-distillation. Besides, the smoothed labels follow a curriculum-style scheduler, getting smoothed to different degrees at different training stages and helping the teacher continuously be adaptive to the varying adversarial examples from student. Extensive experiments have shown the superiority of our strategy in distilling a robust student network against various attacks.}

	abstract = {Zero trust cybersecurity is beginning to replace traditional perimeter-based security strategies and is being adopted by organizations across a wide range of industries. However, the implementation of zero trust is a complex undertaking, different from traditional perimeter-based security, and requires a fresh approach in terms of its management. As such, a clear set of critical success factors (CSFs) will help organizations to better plan, assess, and manage their zero trust cybersecurity. In response, we investigated the CSFs for implementing zero trust cybersecurity by conducting a three-round Delphi study to obtain the consensus from a panel of 12 cybersecurity experts. We built a multi-dimensional CSFs framework that comprises eight dimensions, namely identity, endpoint, application and workload, data, network, infrastructure, visibility and analytics, and automation and orchestration. Based on the CSFs, we developed a maturity assessment framework enabling organizations to evaluate their zero trust maturity. This paper contributes to a theoretical understanding of how to deploy zero trust from multiple dimensions and offers a viable guidance framework for organizations from a practical perspective. This paper is useful for organizational stakeholders who are in the process of planning, reviewing, or implementing zero trust cybersecurity.}

	abstract = {Machine Learning techniques for network-based intrusion detection are widely adopted in the scientific literature. Besides being highly variable, network traffic behavior changes over time, demanding proposed schemes to be periodically updated to ensure their reliability. Unfortunately, their efficiency is significantly limited in production environments. This paper proposes a new Federated Learning model for reliable network-based intrusion detection with highly confident model updates over time. Our proposed scheme assesses the classification reliability in an unsupervised fashion and rejects potential misclassifications even when outdated. In addition, it significantly eases the model update cost by conducting it in a Federated Learning rationale. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we conduct an experimental campaign with a new dataset, MAWIFlow, with over 7 TB of real network traffic spanning a year. The achieved results of our proposed model are striking. It respectively improves the average false-positive and false-negative rates by up to 12% and 9.6% when no model updates are conducted. If done so, it can further improve the false-positive rate by up to 13% while rejecting only 3.6% of events and demanding only 0.3% of events for model updates. Further, the comparison against the traditional Federated Learning approach confirms our model's remarkable performance in several scenarios. Finally, the quality and viability of our solution do prove that our approach can be successfully adopted for improving the accuracy and efficiency of classification systems in real-world scenarios where outdated models are prevalent and pave the way for future research in the area.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables scattered clients to collaboratively train a shared global model. FL is suitable for privacy-preserving applications due to keeping the training data decentralized. However, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks which attempt to embed backdoor triggers into the global model during the training process, and later activate them to cause a desired misclassification. In this paper, to effectively defend against backdoor attacks in the FL system, we propose SCFL including three parts: first, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique is used to extract the significant features of model updates; second, the k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the significant features; finally, cosine similarity is used to measure the distance between two model updates and the optimal clients are selected to aggregate the global model after clipping. Unlike most robust algorithms, SCFL does not limit the number of attackers to be less than that of benign clients, nor does restrict the data distribution among all clients to be independent and identically distributed (IID). Moreover, SCFL does not require any auxiliary information outside of the learning process. We conduct extensive experiments including various types of backdoor attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCFL can effectively defend against these backdoor attacks and outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {To effectively detect network intrusions, Machine Learning (ML) based detection models usually integrate Feature Selection (FS) methods for data enhancements as the ensemble models to achieve better detection accuracy (ACC). Deep Neural Network (DNN) based detection models can detect large of attacks better than ML-based models and DNN based models usually integrate with Stack Auto Encoder (SAE) as for data enhancements. Some models adopt Random Sampling (RS) as Data Balancing (DB) method to enhance the training data and improve ACC. Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) is a dedicated dataset for WiFi networks and labels three different attack types: impersonation, injection, and flooding. However, the multi-class detection models cannot detect different types of wireless attacks simultaneously with the customized detection configurations for each type of attacks. Thus, we propose Ensemble Binary Detection Model (EBDM) to convert the multi-class detection as binary detection models. Each Binary Model (BM) provides dedicated binary detection for each target class instead of several classes. EBDM collects the best detection results from BMs to achieve better ACC than the classical multi-class detection model. To improve ACC, EBDM proposes new data enhancement mechanisms for FS, DB, and SAE, with the individual detection configurations for the target class in each BM. We propose Ensemble FS (EFS) consisting of three feature scoring methods, Classification And Regression Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Tree, and two feature selection methods, Support Vector Machine and Logical Regression, to provide six selected feature sets and choose the best feature set based on ACC in each BM. EBDM proposes Ensemble DB consisting of Tomek Link, SMOTE, and RS to enhance typical DB adopting RS and provide customized sampling size by the target class size in each BM. EBDM provides four Encoder Modes for SAE to determine the best feature extraction configuration for each BM. EBDM integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation block with DNN to enhance DNN performance. Based on the improved BMs with the customized configurations, EBDM selects the best p-value from BMs. The experiment results show that EBDM can detect three different types of wireless attacks in AWID more accurately than the related works in AWID based on the classical multi-class detection model}

	abstract = {Nowadays, new-generation threats often use multiple means or perform several steps to intrude into networks and ultimately reach their objective. These new threats have multi-staged, and we can understand their intrusion pattern from the kill-chain defensive model. This paper focuses on fusing heterogeneous threat intelligence collected from security information and event management systems to reconstruct multi-step attack scenarios and discover critical attack paths. However, the need for an agreed-upon vocabulary to represent the heterogeneous threat intelligence makes it difficult to model the attack scenarios accurately and efficiently. Therefore, we devise a heterogeneous threat intelligence fusing approach for real-time reconstruction of the attack scenarios. Firstly, we use structured threat information expression (STIX) to format heterogeneous threat intelligence (TI). We analyze the causal relationship of each heterogeneous threat intelligence and piece them together. Then, we model the multi-stage attack scenario reconstruction as a community discovery problem. We mine the attack scenarios with semantic correlation weight and a community detection algorithm. We finally use the open-source benchmark datasets (DARPA 2000, CICIDS 2017) and the real Internet traffic captured from the China Education Research Network backbone (CERNET) to evaluate our work. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposal can accurately reconstruct multi-step attack scenarios and discover covert C&C channels.}

In IoT security, these retention issues are significant and require a robust solution for secure deletion. Secure deletion methods can be categorized into off-chip and on-chip schemes. Off-chip secure deletion schemes, based on block-level erasure operations, are unable to perform real-time trim operations. Consequently, they are vulnerable to hacking threats. On the other hand, on-chip secure deletion schemes enable real-time trim operations by performing deletion on a page-by-page basis. However, the on-chip scheme introduces a challenge of program disturbance for neighboring page data. The proposed on-chip deletion scheme tackles this problem by utilizing ECC code modulation through a partial program operation. This approach significantly reduces the program disturbance issue associated with neighboring page data. Moreover, the proposed code modulation secure deletion scheme allows for real-time verification of the deletion of original data.}
