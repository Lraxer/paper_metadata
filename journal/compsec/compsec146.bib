	abstract = {Android malware is a major cyber threat to the popular Android platform which may influence millions of end users. To battle against Android malware, a large number of machine learning-based approaches have been developed, and have achieved promising results. However, the vast majority of the existing work relies on a large number of labeled samples which are unfortunately not available for the newly reported Android malware families. This poses a critical challenge to classify such few-shot Android malware families. In this paper, we propose FAMCF, a novel few-shot learning-based classification pipeline to solve the problem. Faced with insufficient labeled samples from few-shot malware families, we learn how to extract features by training on another base dataset which is of a much larger scale but has disjoint label space with the few-shot families. We consider three types of features based on static analysis, namely permissions, API calls, and opcodes. We train a classifier for each type of features, utilizing a metric-based few-shot learning approach, and get an ensemble decision. Specifically, for each classifier, given a query sample to be classified, we propose to compare it to the prototypes of all the families, which are generated in a query-dependent way. We compared the classification performance of FAMCF to that of the existing solutions of multiple categories, including those traditional machine learning-based approaches, few-shot Android malware classification approaches, and also state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods from other fields. We also analyzed robustness of FAMCF against multiple popular obfuscation techniques. The extensive experiments on the popular Drebin and CICInvesAndMal2019 datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of FAMCF in classifying few-shot Android malware families, e.g., we achieve at least 4.86% improvement on classification accuracy for Drebin and successfully kept the decrease in accuracy within 1% under the seven common types of obfuscation techniques.}

	abstract = {Due to their open architecture, collaborative filtering recommender systems are susceptible to recommendation attacks, in which attackers inject fake rating data into the system to affect the accuracy of recommendation results. To detect these attacks, numerous detection methods have been designed and proven effective. However, in recent years, deep learning-based recommendation attack models such as GSA-GAN have shown higher concealment, posing new challenges to existing detection methods. Motivated by the need for improved detection, in this paper we propose a new approach called CNN-BAG, which integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) and Bagging (BAG) techniques. CNN-BAG can enhance the detection performance by simultaneously leveraging the deep learning capabilities of CNN and the ensemble learning strengths of Bagging. Firstly, we construct a deep neural network based on CNN as the base learner to automatically extract and learn features of recommendation attacks. Secondly, we use the Bagging algorithm to perform bootstrap sampling on the training data to generate multiple diverse training subsets. The above constructed base learners are then trained on these generated training subsets to produce multiple base classifiers for classifying recommendation attacks. Finally, we combine the base classifiers’ outputs using a majority voting method to obtain the final detection results. To assess the performance of CNN-BAG in detecting recommendation attacks, we compared it against several well-established detection methods on the Movielens-10M and Amazon datasets. Our experiments revealed that CNN-BAG is adept at identifying various attack types, including the deep learning-based recommendation attack models.}

	abstract = {The digital landscape faces an escalating wave of sophisticated malware threats to organizations and individuals, and it is increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The dominance of Windows operating systems across corporate and individual computing environments renders Windows a prime target for cyber threats. As malware increasingly employs advanced code obfuscation and packing techniques to evade static detection, dynamic analysis through API calls has become more helpful in identifying malicious behavior. The deep learning techniques emerge as a promising strategy, significantly advancing the field of malware detection in response to the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we introduce a cutting-edge malware detection framework that utilizes the Longformer model, specifically designed to handle extensive text sequences. Our novel approach transforms API call sequences into detailed natural language descriptions with the help of API descriptions and arguments, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of software behaviors. This transformation allows the Longformer model to identify malicious patterns, offering enhanced detection accuracy efficiently. Comparative analyses with state-of-the-art techniques and conventional deep learning models reveal that our proposed method showcases significant performance improvements in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.992, highlighting its efficacy in accurately identifying and classifying malicious behavior.}

Organizations are often unaware of data breaches for weeks, months, or even years. Sufficient for adversaries to compromise and ex-filtrate business or mission-critical data. Recent research suggests using honeytokens for early detection of data breaches in organizations. Existing honeytoken generation methods rely on regular expressions, rule mining, constraint satisfaction, or representation learning, which are complex and limited to a few attributes. We created a framework for generating and deploying honeytokens in relational databases that actively monitor sensitive records and quickly detect data breaches and their misuse. To generate the honeytoken we have used the hierarchical machine learning algorithm which uses a recursive technique to model the parent–child relationships of multi-table databases. The proposed method enables the organization to take remedial action to reduce the impact of data breaches and complement existing database security solutions.}

	abstract = {The increasing dependence on satellite technology for critical applications, such as telecommunications, Earth observation, and navigation, underscores the need for robust security measures to safeguard these assets from potential cyber threats. Moreover, as many satellite systems rely on the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol for efficient data exchange among onboard subsystems, they become prime targets for cyberattacks. While contributions present various options for detecting attacks in the CAN bus, no one proposes an architecture suitable for satellite systems. To address this concern, this paper presents a novel approach to develop an adaptive distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for satellites, which integrates machine and deep learning techniques for the classification of CAN frames. This system is specifically designed to overcome the inherent power and computational challenges of satellite operations by executing time-based anomaly detection on board, and content-based detection at the ground segment. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, experiments are conducted using representative Datasets. The obtained results demonstrate that the distributed IDS presented in this research offers a promising solution to improve the security of satellite systems by achieving high detection rates ranging from 91.12% to 99.86% (F1-score).}

This widespread adoption of IoT has opened a large threat landscape to computer networks, leaving security gaps in IoT-enabled networks. These resource-constrained devices lack sufficient security mechanisms and become the weakest link in our in computer networks and jeopardize systems and data. To address this issue, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed as one of many tools to mitigate IoT related intrusions. While IDS have proven to be a crucial tools for threat detection, their dependence on labeled data and their high computational costs have become obstacles to real life adoption. In this work, we present IoT-PRIDS, a new framework equipped with a host-based anomaly-based intrusion detection system that leverages “packet representations” to understand the typical behavior of devices, focusing on their communications, services, and packet header values. It is a lightweight non-ML model that relies solely on benign network traffic for intrusion detection and offers a practical way for securing IoT environments. Our results show that this model can detect the majority of abnormal flows while keeping false alarms at a minimum and is promising to be used in real-world applications.}

	abstract = {The exponential increase of Android malware creates a severe threat, motivating the development of machine learning and especially deep learning-based classifiers to detect and mitigate malicious applications. However, these classifiers are susceptible to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data to deceive the classifier and compromise performance. This paper investigates the vulnerability of deep learning-based Android malware classifiers against two adversarial attacks: Data Poisoning with Noise Injection (DP-NI) and Gradient-based Data Poisoning (GDP). In these attacks, we explore the utilization of differential privacy techniques by attackers aiming to compromise the effectiveness of deep learning based Android malware classifiers. We propose and evaluate a novel defense mechanism, Differential Privacy-Based Noise Clipping (DP-NC), designed to enhance the robustness of Android malware classifiers against these adversarial attacks. By leveraging deep neural networks and adversarial training techniques, DP-NC demonstrates remarkable efficacy in mitigating the impact of both DP-NI and GDP attacks. Through extensive experimentation on three diverse Android datasets (Drebin, Contagio, and Genome), we evaluate the performance of DP-NC against proposed adversarial attacks. Our results show that DP-NC significantly reduces the false-positive rate and improves classification accuracy across all datasets and attack scenarios. For instance, our findings on the Drebin dataset reveal a significant decrease in accuracy to 51% and 30% after applying DP-NI and GDP techniques, respectively. However, upon applying the DP-NC defense mechanism, the accuracy in both cases improved to approximately 70%. Furthermore, employing DP-NC defense against DP-NI and GDP attacks leads to a notable reduction in false positive rates by 45.46% and 7.67%, respectively. Similar results have been obtained in two other datasets, Contagio and Genome. These results underscore the effectiveness of DP-NC in enhancing the robustness of deep learning-based Android malware classifiers against adversarial attacks.}

Due to the fixed scheduling structures, typical virtualization obfuscation schemes can be compromised by automated analysis tools. To enhance the protection strength of virtualization obfuscation, additional protection techniques of the virtualization structure have been proposed. However, previously proposed solutions incur significant performance overhead or require a strong assumption in software-protection techniques. We present COVER, a novel virtualization obfuscation technique in conjunction with the flash controller. COVER enhances the obfuscation and protects the secret parameters of the virtualization structure with a flash controller-based secure module. We implement a prototype of COVER and describe a prototype implementation of a flash controller-based secure module on a Solid State Drive (SSD). We demonstrate COVER’s efficacy against various code analysis methods, and evaluate COVER’s performance using a set of real-world applications. The evaluation results demonstrate that COVER effectively protects the secret parameters of the virtualization structure and increases the effort involved in deobfuscation. Compared with two commercial obfuscators, COVER provides additional protection strength without incurring significantly more overhead in terms of runtime and code size.}

	abstract = {Truth discovery technology is widely used in the field of data collection in crowdsourcing; however, with the deepening of people’s privacy awareness, ordinary truth discovery can no longer meet the current user demand for privacy protection, and solving the privacy problem is one of the critical challenges of truth discovery. A number of works have been proposed as the truth discovery mechanism of differential privacy. However, the privacy budget allocation in the known differential privacy truth discovery mechanisms does not consider the data precision differences of multi-source datasets and the anomalous results of small-value data after aggregation. We propose a precision division based on a differential privacy two-layer truth discovery framework to ensure privacy security while considering data precision and can also ensure high-accuracy truth discovery. The main challenges of this paper are how to obtain highly accurate truth values in sparse data scenarios without exposing the original values to the cloud server when performing error correction of aggregated anomalies after noise addition, as well as to improve the precision of truth value estimation of perturbed streaming data based on the refinement of the privacy protection level based on the accuracy of the data. Specifically, we first formulate a data-sampling algorithm to get the data precision of different users and to sieve out the anomalous data and duplicate data to obtain the quality of user-uploaded data. Then, we formulate a new privacy budget allocation mechanism, which synthesizes the sampling situation during data preprocessing and fully considers the data precision to quantify user privacy and turn it into specific values. We provide a quadratic truth discovery mechanism based on a predictive interpolation algorithm when dealing with small-value data, ensuring the reliability of small data aggregation results. We demonstrate that our framework achieves differential privacy for user-supplied data while we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to prove the effectiveness of our system framework.}

Among various KD methods, feature-based KD, which leverages the feature representations from intermediate layers of the teacher model to supervise the training of the student model, has shown superior performance and enjoyed wide application. However, users often overlook potential backdoor threats when using knowledge distillation (KD) to extract knowledge. To address the issue, this paper mainly contributes to three aspects: (1) we try the first step of exploring the security risks in feature-based KD, where implanted backdoors in teacher models can survive and transfer to student models. (2) We propose a backdoor attack method targeting feature distillation, achieved by encoding backdoor knowledge into specific neuron activation layers. Specifically, we optimize triggers to induce consistent feature map values in the teacher model and transfer the backdoor knowledge to student models through these features. We also design an adaptive defense method against this attack. (3) Extensive experiments on four common datasets and six sets of different teacher and student models validate that our attack outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, with an average attack success rate of (\n∼\n×\n1\n.\n5\n). Additionally, we discuss effective defense methods against such backdoor attacks.}

	abstract = {Cyber attacks against power grids, interrupting utility service and causing blackouts are on the rise, and increasingly motivate researchers to investigate this topic. Thereby, models of real-world power grids are an indispensable prerequisite, but operators do not make them available, allegedly for reasons of protection. This security-by-obscurity strategy appears futile as grid artifacts (lines, plants, substations) are large and cannot be easily hidden. It seems promising to infer real-world model data from publicly available data, and indeed, multiple models were generated through Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Questions on the models’ quality remain, however, open but are of utter importance for research building on these models, especially as the results might have considerable impact on society and national security. This paper approaches this particular point and investigates whether OSINT leads to data on real-world power grids of sufficient quality; by the example of the European country of Austria, we investigate whether all parameters that are relevant for power flow analysis, a standard approach in power engineering, can be inferred from publicly available data (OpenStreetMap, national statistics, etc.), and validate this data against ground truths, including governmental land use plans, Google Street View and the power sector’s information material. Our validation shows that the inferred data meets reality well — among others, the extra-high voltage level is 100% (lines) rsp. 98% (substations) complete. Beyond, the inferred data is up-to-date as the construction of lines or substations is always documented in OSM, in 76% of the cases even before finalization of the construction works. An analysis of 24 other European countries revealed that electric systems, substations, and power plants are documented in OSM to a similar extent as in Austria, motivating the application of our approach also to these countries. The contribution of our OSINT-based approach is twofold: First, it facilitates the development of models of real-world power grids, fostering research and discussion that is independent of the power grid operators, in the security domain and beyond. Second, our method represents an attack itself, challenging the energy sector’s security-by-obscurity approach.}

	abstract = {Malicious webshells are the most common attack scripts used by attackers in web penetration. Attackers typically obfuscate strings of PHP-based malicious webshells and encrypt communication traffic to bypass security devices. In this case, the opcode sequences of the PHP-based malicious webshells become excessively long and contain many irrelevant features, which affect the efficacy of the detection method. This study proposes a new PHP-based malicious webshell detection method. The proposed method introduces three simplification strategies for the three main types of nodes in the abstract syntax trees of PHP scripts to reduce the length and noise of opcode sequences of PHP-based malicious webshells. An explicit duration recurrent network (EDRN), a recurrent neural network based on an extended hidden semi-Markov model, is used to detect malicious webshells. Word2vec is adopted to convert the opcode sequences of the PHP scripts into vectors that serve as the input for the EDRN. Experiments were conducted using public datasets collected from GitHub. The experimental results indicated that EDRN outperformed popular recurrent neural networks. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art approaches and mainstream tools, achieving an accuracy of 0.993, an F1 score of 0.990, and a recall rate of 0.991. When only 20% of the datasets were used for training, the proposed method achieved accuracy, recall, and F1 scores of 0.985, 0.983, and 0.980, respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches.}

	abstract = {Data is ubiquitous, powerful and valuable today. With vast instalments of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) infrastructure, data is in abundance albeit sitting in organizational silos. Data Marketplaces have emerged to allow monetization of data by trading it with interested buyers. While centralized marketplaces are common, they are controlled by few and are non-transparent. Decentralized data marketplaces allow the democratization of rates, trading terms and fine control to participants. However, in such a marketplace, ensuring privacy and security is crucial. Existing data exchange schemes depend on a trusted third party for key management during authentication and rely on a ‘one-time-off’ approach to authorization. This paper proposes a user-empowered, privacy-aware, authentication and usage-controlled access protocol for IIoT data marketplace. The proposed protocol leverages the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and is based on the standards of Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC). DIDs empower buyers and give them complete control over their identities. The buyers authenticate and prove claims to access data securely using VC. The proposed protocol also implements a dynamic user-revocation policy. Usage-controlled based access provides secure ongoing authorization during data exchange. A detailed performance and security analysis is provided to show its feasibility.}

	abstract = {Manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) is an emerging network system which interconnects manned aerial vehicles (MAVs) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance mission effectiveness and reduce workloads. Like other wireless systems, MUM-T is prone to attacks from the open communication channel. Therefore, an authentication scheme is required to establish secure and trusted communication between the MAV and the UAV. However, existing schemes fail to provide adequate security features and necessary efficiency, mostly due to their incomprehensive threat modeling and improper use of authentication techniques. Moreover, traditional centralized architecture of the authentication server leads to the single point of failure (SPOF) problem, which jeopardizes the robustness and scalability of MUM-T. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant authentication scheme for MUM-T that will solve these problems. To enhance its security, we construct a new threat model consisting of adversary's capabilities, security features, and security challenges to ensure the security of a scheme under combination attacks. To preserve the highest possible efficiency, we propose the design principle of using lightweight primitives for authentication and applying public key operations in key establishment. To address the SPOF problem, we employ a distributed fault-tolerant mechanism to share registration information within authentication servers and defend against faulty nodes. As is demonstrated by the security proof and performance comparison, our scheme succeeds in improving security and reducing overall costs, which provides a better solution than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in cybersecurity for monitoring network traffic and identifying potential attacks. Existing IDS research largely focuses on known attack detection, leaving a significant gap in research regarding unknown attack detection, where achieving a balance between false alarm rate (identifying normal traffic as attack traffic) and recall rate of unknown attack detection remains challenging. To address these gaps, we propose a novel IDS based on Sigmoid Kernel Transformation and Encoder-Decoder architecture, namely SKT-IDS, where SKT stands for Sigmoid Kernel Transformation. We start with pre-training an attention-based encoder for coarse-grained intrusion detection. Then, we use this encoder to build an encoder–decoder model specifically for 0-day attack detection, training it solely on known traffic using the cosine similarity loss function. To enhance detection, we introduce a Sigmoid Kernel Transformation for feature engineering, improving the discriminative ability between normal traffic and 0-day attacks. Finally, we conducted a series of ablation and comparative experiments on the NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method. With a false alarm rate of 1%, we achieved recall rates for unknown attack detection of 65% and 69% on the two datasets, respectively, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.}

	abstract = {ICT infrastructures are getting increasingly complex, and defending them against cyber attacks is cumbersome. As cyber threats continue to increase and expert resources are limited, organizations must find more efficient ways to evaluate their resilience and take proactive measures. Threat modeling is an excellent method of assessing the resilience of ICT systems, for example, by building Attack Graphs that illustrate an adversary’s attack vectors. Previously, the Meta Attack Language (MAL) was proposed, which serves as a framework to develop Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and generate Attack Graphs for modeled infrastructures. coreLang is a MAL-based threat modeling language that utilizes Attack Graphs to enable attack simulations and security assessments. In this work, we present the first release version of coreLang in which MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques are mapped onto to serve as a validation and identify strengths and weaknesses to benefit the development cycle. Our validation showed that coreLang does cover 46% of all the techniques included in the matrix, while if we additionally exclude the tactics that are intrinsically not covered by coreLang and MAL, the coverage percentage increases to 64%.}

	abstract = {Websites frequently use text-based captcha images to distinguish whether the user is a person or not. Previous research mainly focuses on different training strategies and neglects the characteristics of the text-based captcha images themselves, resulting in low accuracy. For text-based captcha images characterized by rotation, distortion, and non-character elements, we propose an end-to-end attack using a Transformer-based method with triplet deep attention. Firstly, the features of text-based captchas are extracted using ResNet45 with triplet deep attention module and Transformer encoder. The TDA module is capable of learning rotational and distortion features of characters. Subsequently, based on self-attention mechanism, design query, key, and value, and adopt the query enhancement module to enhance the query. The query enhancement module can strengthen character localization and reduce attention drift towards non-character elements. Finally, the feature maps are transformed into probabilities of character for the final text recognition. Experiments are conducted on captcha datasets based on Roman characters from 9 popular websites, achieving average word accuracy of 91.14%. To evaluate the performance of our method on data with small samples, experiments are conducted different scales of training data. Additionally, we use the method on Chinese text-based captcha tasks and achieve average word accuracy of 99.60%. The effectiveness of the method is also explored under conditions of lack of illumination and scene text recognition, where background interference is present.}

Although existing methods achieve remarkable success in vulnerability detection, they have several disadvantages as follows: (1) The irrelevant information is removed from source codes, which have a high noise ratio, thereby utilizing deep learning methods and devising experiments featuring high accuracy. However, deep learning-based detection methods necessitate large-scale datasets. This results in computational hardship with respect to vulnerability detection in small-scale software systems. (2) The majority of the studies perform feature selection by processing vulnerability commits. Despite tremendous endeavors, there are few works detecting vulnerability with source codes. To solve these two problems, in this study, a novel labeling and vulnerability detection algorithm is proposed. The algorithm first exploits source codes with the help of a keyword vulnerability matrix. After that, an ultimate encoded matrix is generated by word2vec, thereby combining the labeling vector with the source code matrix to reveal a trainable dataset for a generalized linear model (GLM). Different from preceding studies, our method performs vulnerability detection without requiring vulnerability commits but using source codes. In addition to this, similar studies generally aim to bring sophisticated solutions for just one type of programming language. Conversely, our study develops vulnerability keywords for three programming languages including C#, Java, and C++, and creates the related labeling vectors by regarding the keyword matrix. The proposed method outperformed the baseline approaches for most of the experimental datasets with over 90% of the area under the curve (AUC). Further, there is a 7.7% margin between our method and the alternatives on average for Recall, Precision, and F1-score with respect to five types of vulnerabilities.}

Consequently, malware remains a significant threat, posing a challenge in developing a low-resource consumption malware detection method that can adjust to updates in the Android API versions. We propose a novel method called MDADroid, which detects malware based on self-built Functionality-API mapping. We start by building a set of permission-related APIs using open-source knowledge. Then, we construct a Functionality-App-API heterogeneous graph based on collected data and establish a Functionality-API mapping from it. Finally, MDADroid transforms app features from the API level to the functionality level for malware detection, ensuring model resilience to API changes. We also design an API similarity calculation method that updates the Functionality-API mapping at a low cost. We evaluate MDADroid on multiple datasets, and the results show that MDADroid achieves an accuracy of 95.22%, 96.23%, 98.77%, and 99.56% on the AndroZoo, CICAndMal 2017, CICMalDroid 2020, and Drebin datasets, respectively, with training and testing times of 2 s, 0.6188 s, 1.34 s, and 1.02 s.

	abstract = {Person detection is one of the most popular object detection applications, and has been widely used in safety-critical systems such as autonomous driving. However, recent studies have revealed that person detectors are vulnerable to physically adversarial patch attacks and may suffer detection failure. Data-side defense is an effective approach to address this issue, owing to its low computational cost and ease of deployment. However, existing data-side defenses have limited effectiveness in resisting adaptive patch attacks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new data-side defense, called Universal Defense Filter (UDFilter). UDFilter covers the input images with an equal-size defense filter to weaken the negative impact of adversarial patches. The defense filter is generated using a self-adaptive learning algorithm that facilitates iterative competition between adversarial patch and defense filter, thus bolstering UDFilter’s ability to defense adaptive attacks. Furthermore, to maintain the clean performance, we propose a plug-and-play Joint Detection Strategy (JDS) during the model testing phase. Extensive experiments have shown that UDFilter can significantly enhance robustness of person detection against adversarial patch attacks. Moreover, UDFilter does not result in a discernible reduction in the model’s clean performance.}

Many organizations have implemented two-factor authentication to enhance security. However, attackers can still steal users' usernames and passwords from two-factor authentication through video attack or shoulder surfing and applied the credential stuffing attack, as most people use the same passwords on different applications. Cue-based authentication provides high protection against shoulder surfing attacks, but it remains vulnerable to video attacks. To mitigate the threats of video attacks, we propose cue-based two-factor authentication (i.e., Cue-2FA), which is distinct from other methods by separating cue display from response input (refer to Chapter 1). We conducted two user studies to compare the usability and security between Cue-2FA and a standard Time-based-One-Time-Password two-factor authentication (i.e., TOTP-2FA). The evaluate results revealed Cue-2FA provides both higher usability and stronger resistance to the shoulder surfing attack. However, when both the cue and response are recorded, Cue-2FA is not more resistant to the video attack than TOTP-2FA. To address this issue, we introduced misleading operations to Cue-2FA when inputting a response, which significantly improves the resistance to the video attack.}

Currently, assessing the compliance of the actual process implemented by an organization with such frameworks is a complex task. The assessment is mainly manually performed and requires much effort in the analysis and evaluation. In this paper, we first propose a taxonomy of compliance deviations to classify and prioritize the impacts of non-compliant causes. We combine trace alignment techniques with a new proposed cost model for the analysis of process deviations rather than process traces to prioritize interventions. We put these contributions into use in a system that automatically assesses the IM process compliance with a reference process model (e.g., the one described in the chosen security framework). It supports the auditor with increased awareness of process issues to make more focused decisions and improve the process’s effectiveness. We propose a benchmark validation for the model, and we show the system’s capability through a usage scenario based on a publicly available dataset of a real IM log. The source code of all components, including the code used for benchmarking, is publicly available as open source on GitHub.}

	abstract = {Although sport has become an important topic in management research, academics have not fully examined the area of cybersecurity and its strategic relevance in sports management, in particular in and for sports events. In the present study, we examined the relationship between sports and cybersecurity and conducted an integrative literature review that categorizes the research that has been published to date, based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. The findings show that the role of cybersecurity in and for sports events is a heavily under-researched area that provides an abundance of scientific opportunities. It is also one that deserves further attention, because cyber-attacks on sports events and associated organisations are increasing. Our integrative literature review offers a more structured understanding of this field of investigation and led to the development of a comprehensive research agenda at the intersection between sports management and information security. As one of the first studies to use a literature review that specifically focuses on cybersecurity in and for sports events, we advance the state-of-the-art scholarship in this critical space, and we take the first step to disseminate best practices in cybersecurity and sports management.}

	abstract = {Effective anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is critical to ensuring the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and systems. However, building a high precision and low false positive rate anomaly detection model for the complex and volatile IoT environment is a challenging task. This is often due to issues such as a lack of anomaly labeling, high data volatility, and the complexity of device mechanisms. Traditional machine learning algorithms and sequence models frequently fail to account for feature correlation and temporal dependency in anomaly detection. Although deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have progressed, there is still room for improvement in precision, recall, and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection model called Meta-MWDG to address these issues. The model is based on a multi-scale discrete wavelet decomposition and a dual graph attention network, which can effectively extract feature correlation and temporal dependency in multivariate time series data. Additionally, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is introduced to improve the model’s generalization performance, enabling it to perform well on new tasks even with a few samples. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is combined with a multi-head self-attention network to output both prediction and reconstruction results in a joint optimization strategy, improving the precision of anomaly detection. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that Meta-MWDG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection.}
