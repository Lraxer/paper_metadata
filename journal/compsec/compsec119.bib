	abstract = {In recent years, user identity verification techniques based on mobile touch interaction are becoming more reliable and prominent. These techniques can be integrated in many types of mobile applications and help preventing illegitimate access to information and storage done by impostors. Such techniques usually rely on binary classification algorithms building models for each user in the system, that require other users data in order to build ones model and in case the other users’ data does not exists, a model cannot be built.In addition using a method that generates a model for each user in the system pose a significant challenge when scaling up to real-world systems. The main drawback with having a great number of models resides in the fact that it is difficult to debug, analyze, update, and fine-tune each individual model. Thus, we introduce a method for generating a unified global model that can verify the identity of every user in the system. Our most fundamental challenge is to preserve the unique behavior of each user in one unified model. Having a global model that was built prematurely also has privacy preserving characteristics, when compared to methods that require other users data. The core idea of our method is a novel behavioral embedding layer that captures and embeds each user’s unique behavior and enables it to be used within global settings. We compared our method to several state-of-the-art techniques in experiments with over 9,000 users on 85 different devices. Our method achieves 0.918 AUC and\n15.6\n%\nEER in efficient global settings, bypassing the second-best method by a large margin of 0.119 on AUC and 11.7% on EER.}

	abstract = {The clutter of files can crash a PC and create psychological stress for individuals and cyber-security risks for enterprises. Therefore, managing digital data has become a significant issue for individuals and organizations. Although there are several articles and some research on individuals’ digital hoarding and cluttering habits, there are limited numbers of studies that associate these behaviors with people’s business lives. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been found that measures and correlates individuals’ digital clutter behaviors and businesses’ digital clutter levels. This study defines digital hoarding as the acquisition of and failure to discard digital clutter and explores it as an issue. This study’s main objective is to raise awareness about digital clutter and reveal the importance and potential risks of this concept for firms and employees. The research also aims to introduce a scale related to digital clutter into the literature and present a structure for measuring the digital clutter levels of individuals and enterprises and reveal the relationship among the factors. The digital clutter status of both individuals and enterprises was derived from 600 responses. This research reveals that those at the lower level of the organizational hierarchy, people with a high level of education, young people, and those with multiple social media accounts are more prone to digital hoarding behavior. The enterprise-related analyzes reveal that 6 to 10-year-old businesses and small businesses were more vulnerable to digital clutter. The study reveals that as firms transform digitally, they also transform their employees, and even if this is not enough to make the 50 and above age group superior, it still allows them to exceed expectations. This finding strengthens the estimation that the data management policies of elder firms may be interiorized by individuals, increase their awareness and prevent digital hoarding.}

Consequently, the protection of a nation’s cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. This signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber sovereignty. This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs’ curricula learning outcomes were generated from the GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: Development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals’ cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their program’s curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces.}

	abstract = {Privacy protection and traitor tracing have always been two separate research subjects. Meanwhile, digital fingerprinting, which tracks illegally distributed digital media by creating a unique code for each user, has long been regarded as one of the effective means of tracking down illegal users. However, most of the existing fingerprinting schemes focus on how to design a more robust or general fingerprint code to target illegal users more effectively, without paying attention to privacy protection itself. Our paper proposes a novel idea to simultaneously perform privacy protection and traitor tracing on massive aggregated data. And further, a detailed Secure Noise FingerPrinting based on Differential Privacy (SNFP-DP) scheme is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the idea by integrating differential privacy and digital fingerprinting. The SNFP-DP scheme builds the well-designed noise for each specific computing node into the numerically aggregated data set, realizing fingerprint inserting and noise disturbance in one step. The privacy of Noised Aggregated FingerPrint Data (NAFPD) generated by our SNFP-DP scheme can be protected by adding appropriate noise, while the source of illegal dissemination can be determined by identifying the fingerprint in the NAFPD. In addition, we instantiate the SNFP-DP scheme on real-world data by specifying the values of all key parameters. The experimental results show that the NAFPD meets the requirements of data privacy protection and statistical analysis accuracy. And it also has the robustness and security characteristics as the digital fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a thorough performance analysis through mathematical formula derivation and security attack simulation.}

	abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of cybersecurity education, awareness raising, and training (CEAT) on the vitality of internet use and services at the national level. CEAT encompasses one of five dimensions of a larger cybersecurity capacity building model (CMM) that was developed by the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre. The paper describes this dimension of capacity building within the CMM, and its indicators of education, awareness, and training in cybersecurity capacity. The paper then presents a cross-national analysis of the outcomes of CEAT on internet use based on comparative data from 80 nations. Controlling for contextual variables, such as the wealth of the nations and scale of internet use, the analysis shows a positive and statistically significant impact of CEAT on the vitality of internet use and services, as well as a distribution of CEAT scores that indicates key issues for low-income and developing nations. A qualitative analysis of responses from these nations is used to identify key reasons for their levels of maturity in this area. While recognising key limitations of these findings, it offers suggestions for policy and practice to meet the need for effective programs for education, awareness raising, and training. In addition, the research suggests the need for more detailed indicators of CEAT initiatives in more nations and over time to assess the validity of the findings and the recommendations for policy and practice in this area of capacity building offered in this paper.}

	abstract = {Switched telephone networks are a key and ubiquitous infrastructure. Recent technological advances have integrated modern and inexpensive systems into these networks in order to use the Internet to place calls via Voice over IP (VoIP). The evolution of this technology has also led to an increase in the number and sophistication of the techniques used by criminals to commit fraud. Specifically, with the emergence of VoIP, attackers can now adapt tools commonly used by cybercriminals, such as botnets, to make their attacks more complex and insidious. For example, through bots they can dial multiple numbers automatically, enabling them to target a greater number of victims, and do so more quickly. While recent studies have shed light on how certain parts of this ecosystem work, it is still unclear how attacks on VoIP systems contribute to this type of fraud. This paper presents a novel VoIP honeypot that captures voice interactions, in addition to employing low-level telemetry. With the study of how attackers obtain access to our honeypot and the actions they perform, we present an overview of the most prevalent types of fraud used in this ecosystem, including unique insights into the origin of the attacks and the destination of calls made through our architecture. Finally, we analyze in depth the actions taken to study the different types of telephony fraud.}

We propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach that takes data (containing normal behaviors and known attacks) and apply clustering to determine the space of unavailable patterns that need to be generated for evolving normal behaviors as well as unknown network attacks. We have extended the JointGAN model with a new min-max game making JointGAN as a distribution aware data synthesis approach. It generates the identified sample space by computing joint distribution over two distinct latent spaces (clusters) produced by semi-supervised learning approach. After that, the generated sample space is used to train the model. MARK uses labeled data as a base for generating unavailable data to improve the model training performance. The key novelty is that our approach detects the emerging network attacks with no labeled data. We evaluate this idea and show our approach can train a model that outperforms existing methods with no labeled data.}

This research confirms that victims often weigh the costs and benefits of interventions before making final decisions, and that their decisions are based on a range of reasons. As ransomware attacks become more prevalent globally, the findings should be highly relevant to those developing guidance and policies to prevent or minimise ransom payments.}

Single feature-based malicious code detection methods have achieved good detection results, but when faced with some similar malicious code families, the detection effect is often poor. To address this concern, we propose a feature fusion-based malicious code detection with dual attention mechanism and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). The dual attention mechanism module gives different focuses on the channel and space of feature maps to extract local texture features of malicious code grayscale images. At the same time, the BiLSTM module extracts global texture structure features of malicious code grayscale images, and fuse local texture features with global texture features, which can not only reflect the detailed characteristics of malicious code, but also retain the overall structural characteristics. Finally, we use the focal loss function to reduce the impact of data imbalance. The experimental results show that our feature fusion approach has a better detection effect compared with the single feature approach, especially in the detection of similar malicious code families.}

	abstract = {With the flourishment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the quality of services on online social networks (OSNs) has improved tremendously. Through the introduction of AI into OSNs, providers enhance the users experience. However, the risk of data misuse has also been magnified. And there has been a trend towards users’ mistrust when it comes to sharing their true intention on OSN platforms, primarily because of privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose an effective intention-concealing visitation framework named Aviv, which acts as a credible and private third-party where it generates artificial intention-concealed browsing (AICB trajectories) for users to conceal their true intentions. The browsing trajectory is a sequence composed of blogs, bloggers, news, or a mixture containing visitable content. Specifically, Aviv first extracts accessible graphs composed of visitable contents from applied OSN platforms. Then an elaborate and personalized divert scoring process is conducted to measure optional decoy visits’ effectiveness. Finally, using the divert scoring values, elaborate and personalized decoy visits are picked out, Aviv composes AICB trajectories with true intentions and picked decoy visits. Aviv is implemented as a credible private third-party and tested on a real OSN, the performance evaluation results show that Aviv is effective and efficient.}
