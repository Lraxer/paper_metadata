	abstract = {IoT Device fingerprinting of network traffic is valuable for many management and security solutions as it provides insights into the devices active on a network. Unfortunately, existing techniques focus on the public (de facto) standard protocol and suffer from low efficiency and high data packet dependence at flow-level granularity. Hence, accurately identifying the types of proprietary-protocol-oriented IoT devices is still a challenge that cannot be ignored. As a solution, we propose DeepFinger, a full-automated, byte-level payload fingerprint generation approach to fill this gap. DeepFinger aims to eliminate the manual intervention required to extract available payload-driven fingerprints, in the absence of priori protocol specification information. The key sight of DeepFinger is that it utilizes deep clustering to automatically cluster similar payloads and infer key-blocks as fingerprints. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that DeepFinger achieves the average TPR with\n98.81\n%\n, the average FTF with\n98.74\n%\n, and the average FPR with\n0.07\n%\non the dataset containing multiple proprietary protocols. In addition, on three datasets containing public protocols such as MQTT, Modbus, HTTP, and XMPP, DeepFinger also achieved excellent performance by virtue of its extensibility. These results suggest that DeepFinger can be a promising tool for automatizing the payload fingerprint extraction process, based on proprietary protocol assumption.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability management strategy, from both organizational and public policy perspectives, hinges on an understanding of the supply of undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is small enough, then a reasonable investment strategy would be to focus on finding and removing the remaining undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is and will continue to be large, then a better investment strategy would be to focus on quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems. This paper examines a paradigm, namely that the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is manageably small, through the lens of mathematical concepts from the theory of computing. From this perspective, we find little support for the paradigm of limited undiscovered vulnerabilities. We then briefly support the notion that these theory-based conclusions are relevant to practical computers in use today. We find no reason to believe undiscovered vulnerabilities are not essentially unlimited in practice and we examine the possible economic impacts should this be the case. Based on our analysis, we recommend vulnerability management strategy adopts an approach favoring quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems, while continuing good software engineering practices to reduce (but never eliminate) vulnerabilities in information systems.}

	abstract = {Internet of Everything (IoE) is playing key role to enable smart energy management in buildings. A huge amount of load data are accumulated continuously to control the energy systems inside buildings. Big data analysis and prediction play increasingly vital roles in making the building energy systems smarter. Meanwhile, the big data forecasting technique represents the key element for an efficient energy control mechanism in buildings. However, the load forecast models require a huge amount of consumption data with enough variety to achieve high accuracy. Moreover, the collected IoE data are privacy-sensitive. That is, the fine-grained load data collected at the level of buildings may reveal information about the occupant’s behaviors. In this paper, by using Federating Learning (FL) as a decentralized machine learning technique, buildings occupants’ information can efficiently participate in the decision-making without revealing privacy through a cloud/Edge computing framework. In the FL approach, the big data are widely distributed between buildings, where a shared learning model is trained locally on each of the buildings. Nonetheless, the FL approach does not provide provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, FL requires participating buildings to regularly exchange huge updates resulting in huge bandwidth consumption. The paper presents a new privacy-preserving bandwidth-efficient FL that relies on Differential Privacy to theoretically provide privacy. Furthermore, to ensure the fast convergence of the FL model, a POWER-SELECTION protocol is introduced to select between buildings to participate in the FL round. By numerical analysis, the proposed FL approach is demonstrated to improve the accuracy of load forecast while compromising provable privacy.}

This paper presents a static detection approach that employs music information retrieval techniques. Detection based on a single, or a few, acoustic features suffer from reduction in classification accuracy, due to the use of limited ‘views’. In this paper, we propose a multi-audio feature-fusion approach, which merges audio features of heterogeneous views in order to detect Android malware. Sixty-three standard audio signal processing features and thirty-nine biologically inspired audio features were extracted, after converting the Android application package files into waveform audio files. The biologically inspired features were derived from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC), and Bark Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (BFCC). Experimental results show that the proposed audio-based malware detection features are effective and need to be further studied. Using the traditional eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm on the CICMaldroid 2020 dataset, the proposed approach achieved accuracy, recall, f1-score, and AUC scores of 98.96%, 99.65%, 99.30% and 98.14% respectively. An average-precision (AP) score of 100% was also achieved.}

Until now, the information available when a new vulnerability is published is manually assessed by experts using a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector and score. This assessment is time consuming and requires expertise. Various works already try to predict CVSS vectors or scores using machine learning based on the textual descriptions of the vulnerability to enable faster assessment. However, for this purpose, previous works only use the texts available in databases such as National Vulnerability Database. With this work, the publicly available web pages referenced in the National Vulnerability Database are analyzed and made available as sources of texts through web scraping. A Deep Learning based method for predicting the CVSS vector is implemented and evaluated. The present work provides a classification of the National Vulnerability Database’s reference texts based on the suitability and crawlability of their texts. While we identified the overall influence of the additional texts is negligible, we outperformed the state-of-the-art with our Deep Learning prediction models.}

	abstract = {Micro and small businesses are increasingly reliant on digital and online technology. They have, though, very limited resources and expertise to devote to cyber security. There is, thus, a pressing economic and social challenge of how to improve cyber security in small businesses. We look at the potential role of IT companies as a conduit through which to cascade information on best practice, focusing on the United Kingdom. We first present an analysis of the UK’s Cyber Security Breaches Survey (2018–2021) distinguishing different channels through which micro and small businesses access information on cyber security. We find that the main channel, by far, is through IT companies. Very few businesses directly access information from the government or law enforcement. To further explore the role of IT companies we conducted a series of focus groups and interviews with experts in IT and cyber security for small businesses in the UK. One theme to emerge is that IT companies, while they can be part of the solution, can also be part of the problem and so a number of interventions are needed if IT companies are to effectively disseminate best practice. These include advice and guidance for micro and small businesses on how to distinguish ‘good’ IT companies, as well as appropriate support for IT companies, who themselves are typically micro and small businesses that lack expertise on cyber security.}

	abstract = {During the localization process in wireless networks, risks such as Sybil attacks and nodes’ location privacy leakage can exist due to the open and shared nature of wireless networks. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate location for sensor nodes while preserving the privacy of observer nodes who assist in sensor node localization while in the presence of Sybil attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure and private localization algorithm, PrSLoc, based on Differential Privacy and Approximate Point-In-Triangulation (APIT, a range-free positioning algorithm). Specifically, APIT is applied for sensor nodes’ localization based on the received signal strength (RSS) from observer nodes as APIT doesn’t require special hardware or additional devices to estimate node positions. Besides, Differential Privacy technique is utilized to protect the privacy of observer nodes’ location information (i.e., nodes’ identity, location, and transmission power). Additionally, we mitigate Sybil attacks using a novel lightweight Sybil detection approach introduced in this paper that is based on the twice difference of the perceived RSS. Simulation results demonstrate that PrSLoc can efficiently eliminate Sybil nodes while preserving the observers’ privacy during wireless localization processes. Furthermore, the computation overhead and storage cost of the proposed PrSLoc are competitive compared with existing work.

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising computing paradigm that utilizes human intelligence to achieve complex tasks, but it encounters several security and trust issues. Blockchain is a potential technology that can resolve most of these issues, however, it is difficult to find an appropriate consensus protocol applicable to crowdsourcing systems. Therefore, this work presents a Trust and Transactions Chain (TTC) consensus protocol built upon blockchain technology. It selects a trusted leader and validators considering a trust model which depends on deposit ratio, block generation and validation rate, and waiting rate. The TTC protocol addresses the main challenge of ensuring correctness related to critical systems of crowdsourcing which has extreme significance as their failure can result in disastrous consequences. This work is primarily focused on fraud-resilience avoiding double-spending attack. It also deals with sybil and eclipse attacks. Model checking is exploited because it is effective and automatic to conduct formal verification. The TTC protocol is formally modeled utilizing Communicating Sequential Programs, and the fraud-resilience property is specified using Linear Temporal Logic. The verification of the model is done using Process Analysis Toolkit that takes the formal model and specified properties as input to inspect the properties’ satisfaction or violation. The results of the formal verification are analyzed with respect to the verification time and the number of visited states.}

We find that enacting mandatory data sharing sometimes creates situations in which at most one of the two insurers invests in data quality, whereas both insurers would invest when information sharing is not mandatory. This raises concerns about the merits of making data sharing mandatory.}

Current survey papers on indoor positioning methods mainly focus on positioning accuracy, whereas discussion on security and privacy considerations is limited. While there are survey papers on the security/privacy of LBS, they mainly focus on the services rather than the positioning methods. On the other hand, various survey papers on Internet of Things security/privacy mostly address device and system security. To fill the gap and complement the aforementioned survey papers, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive survey on indoor positioning security and privacy, focusing on the positioning methods. In particular, we provide the following contributions. First, based on general search (using the systematic PRISMA approach) and specific search, we study related papers published in recent years with the aim of addressing three research questions. Second, to facilitate the survey and study, we categorise the positioning methods into non-collaborative methods (i.e., proximity-based, geometric and fingerprinting methods), collaborative methods (i.e., mobile proximity-based and mobile geometric methods) and others (combining multiple technologies/methods). Third, for each method, we give an overview of the method and discuss its security and privacy issues. Last but not least, we highlight some future research directions and work on indoor positioning security and privacy. In particular, there is a need to conduct more research on collaborative positioning methods, including their security and privacy issues.}

In this paper, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) based approach to check the satisfiability of all SoD constraints. It can be applied to different SoDs. Hence, it is feasible in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we present an ILP based violation solution that can correct all SoD violations with a minimum number of restrictions regarding users’ normal operations on target objects. All SoD violations can be solved in a once-and-done way while simultaneously guaranteeing the satisfaction of all SoD constraints.}

While boosting rich applications in browser, this technology is also very efficient to develop cryptojacking malware. This has triggered the development of several methods to detect cryptojacking malware. However, these defenses have not considered the possibility of attackers using evasion techniques. This paper explores how automatic binary diversification can support the evasion of WebAssembly cryptojacking detectors. We experiment with a dataset of 33 WebAssembly cryptojacking binaries and evaluate our evasion technique against two malware detectors: VirusTotal, a general-purpose detector, and MINOS, a WebAssembly-specific detector. Our results demonstrate that our technique can automatically generate variants of WebAssembly cryptojacking that evade the detectors in 90% of cases for VirusTotal and 100% for MINOS. Our results emphasize the importance of meta-antiviruses and diverse detection techniques and provide new insights into which WebAssembly code transformations are best suited for malware evasion. We also show that the variants introduce limited performance overhead, making binary diversification an effective technique for evasion.}

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to train the machines to perform various complicated tasks that begin to modify and improve with experiences. It has become widely used for automated decisions. In particular, the applications which have a profound impact on society that rely on Deep Learning (DL) for autonomous decisions, such as Patient Health Record (PHR), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), etc. Such impacts have a vital concern about the potential vulnerabilities introduced by DL. Traditional attackers have powerful motives that can alter and modify DL algorithms to subvert the outcomes. In poisoning attacks, an attacker can consciously change training dataset, which is used to operate the outcomes of decision-based model. While in privacy and evasion attacks, an adversary can also misclassify new datasets to infer private information. Therefore, in this paper, we have provided a review of security and privacy issues of DL algorithms and analyzed their applications and challenges based on state-of-the-art literature. We have classified attacks, devised a taxonomy, and comprehensive analysis of defense techniques for the most common attacks such as poisoning, evasion, model extraction, and model inversion. We have also presented various privacy preserving techniques to ensure the privacy of dataset. We have proposed a secure cryptographic framework for dataset based on hash functions and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) scheme. Finally, we have provided recent research challenges and future studies concerning security and privacy issues. We believed that the highlighted limitations and weaknesses provide possible research questions and open matters for designing efficient future DL algorithms.}

	abstract = {There is a growing trend of cyberattacks against Internet of Things (IoT) devices; moreover, the sophistication and motivation of those attacks is increasing. The vast scale of IoT, diverse hardware and software, and being typically placed in uncontrolled environments make traditional IT security mechanisms such as signature-based intrusion detection and prevention systems challenging to integrate. They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules. Machine learning methods have shown faster response to emerging threats; however, model training architectures like cloud or edge computing face multiple drawbacks in IoT settings, including network overhead and data isolation arising from the large scale and heterogeneity that characterizes these networks.}

However, malicious traffic labeling approaches can easily lead to incorrect labeling, which can have a harmful impact on models. To this end, various methods for learning with noise labels have been proposed. They exclude suspected wrong samples from model updates to ensure accuracy. However, this also removes hard samples, resulting in poor model decision boundaries and the loss of ability to classify hard samples.

	abstract = {Responsibilizing governments provide advice about how to manage a variety of risks. If citizens do not heed the advice and things go wrong, they are expected to accept the adverse consequences without complaint. However, in some cases, citizens are unable or unwilling to embrace these government-assigned responsibilities and to act on the advice, for a variety of valid reasons. It may be appropriate for governments to provide more direct support: in essence, deresponsibilizing citizens who struggle to embrace the responsibility. In this paper, we explore whether US citizens would be willing to accept more help from their government in the cyber realm. Using two studies, we find that perceptions related to the government's competence and benevolence are necessary pre-requisites for a willingness to be deresponsibilized, and also that many respondents did not have confidence that either of these were sufficient. This deficiency might well render governments’ well-intended deresponsibilization endeavours futile. We conclude by proposing deresponsibilization strategies that acknowledge and accommodate this.}

While ICC is a powerful feature, it also presents a serious attack surface. This paper addresses the issue of generating exploits for a subset of Android ICC vulnerabilities (i.e., IDOS, XAS, and FI) using static analysis, Deep Reinforcement Learning-based dynamic analysis, and software instrumentation. Our approach, called RONIN, outperforms state-of-the-art and baseline tools in terms of the number of exploited vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Social engineering cyber-attacks such as phishing emails pose a serious threat to the safety of many organizations. Given that the effectiveness of these attacks heavily relies on poor human decision making, an improved understanding of the individual characteristics that increase cybersecurity vulnerability could inform more targeted training. The current study aimed to identify whether several factors, including phishing email detection ability, confidence in one's phishing identification decisions, general attitudes towards one's level of responsibility and efficacy, and employee satisfaction and loyalty to the organization, may predict behavior in a naturalistic phishing simulation in an employment setting. We followed up employees of a large organization who had been recently targeted by a phishing simulation and asked them to complete a survey that included a phishing detection task. The employees’ behavior in the phishing simulation was ranked according to its safety: reporting the suspicious email, neither reporting nor clicking on the embedded link, and clicking on the link. We found that fewer years of employment at the organization and lower employee satisfaction and loyalty predicted increasingly unsafe behavior in the simulation. This suggests that newer and unsatisfied employees are most vulnerable to phishing attempts and might benefit most from targeted cybersecurity training.}

	abstract = {Botnets often use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to generate lots of Algorithmically Generated Domains (AGDs), which seem real, to hide their attacks. So, knowing the DGAs is very helpful for the precise and fast detection of AGDs, which is essential for network security. However, the detection of AGDs still needs further improvement due to existing problems. First, various DGAs change at any time, bringing the need for models to fit quickly in the pattern of new DGAs. Second, the mechanisms of different DGAs are divergent. Therefore, it requires a strong ability of models to learn the DGAs well. Third, most AGDs are blind to people, so models trained on available data are difficulty having generalized detection ability. To solve these problems, the paper proposes CL-GAN: A GAN-based Continual Learning Model for Generating and Detecting AGDs. CL-GAN is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and includes three parts: a Generator to learn the DGAs, a Discriminator to detect the AGDs and a Teacher to provide existing learned knowledge. Further, CL-GAN also constructs prompt noises to enhance the ability to generate AGDs of the Generator. The paper conducts experiments on the domains from 360DGA and Alexa Top 1M. Compared with existing models, the results show the generality and effectiveness of CL-GAN and its life-long ability to detect AGDs.}
