	abstract = {Cloud computing  has become a prevalent platform for  data storage  and evaluation, but its open access through the internet makes stored data vulnerable to a range of security threats. The existing security mechanisms, though effective, often fall short in addressing advanced and evolving intrusion techniques. This motivates the need for a more robust, efficient, and intelligent  access control  system that can not only detect intrusions but also prevent unauthorized access in real-time. This study proposes an Optimized Dual  Access Control mechanism  for secure cloud-based  data storage  and distribution using Global-Context Residual  Recurrent Neural Network  (DAC-GCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS). This novel approach aims to enhance both data protection and access management in cloud environments. The proposed methodology contains three distinct phases: (i) registration phase, (ii)  intrusion detection  phase, (iii)  intrusion prevention  phase. During the registration phase, user credentials are created for secure data uploads. The data undergoes pre-processing in the  intrusion detection  phase, where redundant and noisy information is filtered out using Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture Filtering (PMBMF). This ensures  data normalization  and sanitization, preparing it for the classification process. The core of this process involves the use of the Global-Context Residual  Recurrent Neural Network  (GCRRNN), which automatically classifies users as legitimate or unauthorized. To further enhance  classification accuracy , the GCRRNN is optimized using the Fractional-Order Fish Migration Optimization Algorithm (FOFMOA). The  intrusion prevention  phase involves verifying user identity through  login credentials , ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access. The effectiveness of the proposed DAC-GCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS model is validated using the Enron Email Database, and its performance is measured through key metrics like sensitivity, precision, F-score, specificity, error rate, accuracy, and ROC curve analysis. The proposed method attains 23.98 %, 21 %, 29 % higher accuracy, 27.94 %, 21.09 %, 30 % higher precision, 10.87 %, 17.98 %, 22 % lower error rate compared with the existing techniques.}

Not only is it concerned with the protection of digital assets and resources from illegitimate use, but it is also essential to people’s privacy, for example for shielding their personal data, and even to their safety, for example for safeguarding the functioning of devices that may potentially harm humans. This article investigates the extent to which cybersecurity is properly ensured of IoT devices (also commonly termed  smart devices ) which are modern, that is, trendy at present, then also inexpensive, hence useful to evaluate a price-cybersecurity ratio, and, finally, commonly used. While it is clear that innumerable such devices exist, the findings reported below focus on the case of the Tapo ecosystem by TP-Link, which features cheap Amazon best sellers at present. Our findings suggest that effective Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing sessions can be carried out on such devices by following the PETIoT kill chain. Findings also demonstrate that as many as six devices of the TAPO ecosystem suffer four previously unknown (so called  zero-day ) vulnerabilities, which we filed as four CVEs on MITRE’s public database. Following Responsible Disclosure with TP-Link, vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed only after the vendor released appropriate fixes. All vulnerabilities were found using freeware, requiring over 600 lines of exploitation code.}

	abstract = {Today’s interconnected IT and OT infrastructure faces an array of cyber threats from diverse actors with varying motivations and capabilities. The increasing complexity of exposed systems, coupled with adversaries’ sophisticated technical arsenals, poses significant challenges for organizations seeking to defend against these attacks. Understanding the relationship between specific attack techniques and effective technical, organizational and human-centric mitigation measures remains elusive, as does grasping the underlying principles of information security and how they may be applied to cyber defense. In response to these challenges, we propose a gamified metamodel that combines well-established frameworks, including MITRE ATT&CK, D3FEND, CAPEC, and the NIST SP 800-53 security standard. The programmatic implementation of the model, “PenQuest”, combines elements of game theory with cybersecurity concepts to enhance risk assessment and training for IT practitioners and security engineers. In PenQuest, participants engage in a digital battle —  attackers attempt  to compromise an abstracted IT infrastructure, while defenders work to prevent or mitigate the threat. Bot opponents and the technical foundation for  reinforcement learning  enable future automated strategy inference. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of the metamodel, the game’s components and features built to translate cybersecurity principles into strategy game rules, and the technical implementation of a mature, ready-to-use education and risk exploration solution. Future work will focus on further improving the attack likelihood and detection chance algorithms for seamless risk assessment.}

	abstract = {Estimating frequency distributions in multidimensional  categorical data  is fundamental for many real-world applications, but such data often contains sensitive personal information, necessitating robust privacy protection. The emerging shuffled  differential privacy  (SDP) model provides a promising solution, yet existing methods are either limited to single-dimensional data or suffer from poor accuracy in multidimensional scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Multiple Hash Mechanism (MHM), which uses an innovative hash-based local  perturbation technique  for efficient dimensionality reduction to improve the result accuracy under the SDP framework. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the shuffling benefits of MHM outputs, showing significant accuracy improvements. For cases requiring personalized privacy levels, we propose the Overlapping Group Mechanism, which further enhances the shuffling benefits and boosts overall accuracy. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Voice assistants  are becoming increasingly popular. While users may benefit from the convenience of voice interactions, the use of voice assistants raises privacy issues. To address them, existing voice assistants propose some privacy settings. However, we are lacking knowledge about (1) which privacy settings are important to users, (2) what are their preferences about their application, and (3) what are their requirements beyond existing privacy settings. Gaining such knowledge is important to understand why users may not use these settings and to identify which settings should be introduced to allow users to better protect their privacy. To this end, we have conducted a quantitative online study with 1,103 German smart speaker owners. Detailed insights are provided into how beliefs about data handling practices, usage of existing privacy settings, affinity for technology interaction, and privacy attitudes vary depending on the brand of smart speakers used by participants. These findings reveal discrepancies in user trust and preferences across different manufacturers. Additionally, statistical evaluations, including effect size calculations, are introduced, alongside expanded results with detailed explanations to enhance the contextual understanding of the findings. The study provides recommendations for manufacturers and policymakers to improve transparency, usability, and education on privacy settings.  Practical guidelines  for privacy-preserving features are included, advancing understanding of user needs and aiding in the design of better solutions. In addition to partly replicating findings obtained with different samples, the results show that the currently available privacy settings do not fully cover user requirements and indicate a general desire for more transparency and control over the  collected data . Our results hence serve as basis for designing future privacy-preserving solutions.}

	abstract = {Driven by the demand for ubiquitous connectivity, the increasing interaction between in-vehicle and external devices makes it easier for attack vectors and vulnerabilities to penetrate vehicles. As a typical cyber–physical system, the communications among  actuators  and sensors are mostly completed through in-vehicle networks, which does not concern cybersecurity threats of its original design. To effectively prevent potential security risks, deploying an  intrusion detection system  is a feasible and practical solution to detect and identify abnormalities in network traffic. But for development, it must balance embedded device resources with model complexity. This study proposes an  anomaly detection  method based on spectral residuals and depth-separable  convolutional neural networks  for in-vehicle networks. Specifically, the spectral residual operation is used to  remove redundancies  in the signal input to highlight the abnormal points, while the lightweight convolutional block is designed to tackle the challenge of sophisticated decisions. First, we design an image builder to transform  signal sequence  data into matrix-like structures for easy change of the  intrusion detection  problem to an  image classification  problem. Then, we construct the lightweight  convolutional network , optimized for vehicular signals, to achieve high detection performance without the unnecessary complexity of the MobileNet model architecture. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm successfully detects various attacks, while having no unacceptable resource consumption and compute pipeline congestion. More importantly, compared with other advanced  anomaly detection  models on an in-vehicle network dataset, the results illustrate its superiority in detecting unknown attacks.}

Our research suggests a multi-criteria approach in analyzing possible factors that influence an awareness of information  security vulnerabilities . Drawing from prior cybersecurity and  vulnerability assessment  research, this empirical field study develops a research model to analyze possible determinants influencing information security vulnerability awareness. Three constructs were considered to explore their association to information security vulnerability awareness:  vulnerability assessment , assessment of IS security controls, and knowledge of an organization's cyber threatscape. The data analyzed was obtained via a survey questionnaire instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to validate the proposed research model. Results of this analysis indicate that these three constructs and their related indicator constructs are significantly correlated with an awareness of information security vulnerability. These results provide useful insights for organizations regarding their awareness of information security vulnerability in an increasingly evolving global cyber threatscape.}

To address this issue, a new labeled dataset, namely the TestCloudIDS dataset, is proposed, which contains fifteen variants of  DDoS attacks  in the cloud environment. In contrast to other datasets lacking realism and coverage of the latest attack strategies, it closely resembles the real world because of its careful construction. It integrates a wide range of attack situations, utilizing both conventional and current vectors, focusing on incorporating state-of-the-art techniques such as Raven Storm. In addition, we propose “SparkShield”, a technique for  intrusion detection  using  Apache Spark  within a  big data environment . The effectiveness of “SparkShield” is evaluated through in-depth research using a variety of datasets and simulated attack scenarios. Three existing datasets are used to measure performance: UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and the proposed TestCloudIDS dataset.

	abstract = {With the fierce game between attack and defense technology,  network security  threats become increasingly covert.  Dependency graphs  generated from system audit logs are currently critical tools for attack investigating. However, these graphs typically encounter the dependency explosion (edges usually exceeding 100k), making it challenging for security experts to directly analyze the attack behaviors. To reduce analysts’ workload and retain all attack activities in the dependency graph, recent research has proposed community partitioning algorithms on dependency graph. However, they fail to handle the entity involving multiple system tasks, and leave a mixture of entities associated with both attack-related tasks and normal system tasks in the graph, making the analysis of attack investigation difficult. In this paper, we propose  FineGCP , a novel fine-grained dependency  graph partitioning  method to address the issue of entity involving different tasks. The key idea is to distinguish entities involved in different system tasks, and assign entities performing the same task to the same community. To this end, we first introduce an execution partitioning technique that divides entities in the graph into fine-grained execution units based on their tasks. Second, considering system tasks are usually completed through the collaboration of multiple entities, we developed a  graph partitioning  technique for performing node embedding and community partitioning on the entities in the fine-grained dependency graphs through leveraging distinct  topological structures  formed by different tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of  FineGCP  using two public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that  FineGCP  aggregates attack nodes into an average of 1.34 communities, with 97% of the nodes in these communities being attack-related nodes, effectively aiding in attack investigations.}

Logs play a critical role in this vast volume of data as digital records capture notable events within systems or processes. Large-scale systems generate an overwhelming number of logs, making manual examination by analysts infeasible during critical events or attacks. While hashes, whether cryptographic or fuzzy, are widely used in digital forensics because they serve as the foundation for software integrity and validation, authentication and identification, similarity analysis, and fragment detection, this study investigates and extends the use of approximate matching (AM) algorithms in semi-structured data, such as logs. Existing AM algorithms such as  ssdeep ,  sdhash ,  TLSH , and  LZJD  struggle particularly with semi-structured data due to the size of the input data being comparatively small, with syntactical and structural information comprising a significant amount of the data. We present a novel approximate matching algorithm for application across a range of semi-structured data types, which requires no knowledge of the underlying data structure. The algorithm produces digests that serve as input to a machine learning classifier, classifying the behaviour of the underlying logs the hashes represent. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset of IoT network traffic show that the proposed framework can correctly discern malicious logs from benign records with a 95% accuracy, with an F1 score of 0.98. The behaviour of the records deemed malicious was then correctly identified with a 99% accuracy when evaluated using a test data set, producing an average F1 score of 0.99. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach provides a faster and lightweight framework to perform classification with high accuracy on a list of logs, producing those indicative of an attack for review.}

Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide unique and unclonable keys, but many PUFs struggle with key randomness and are vulnerable to attacks like Machine Learning-related Modeling (MLMo) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. This work introduces a Crossover  Ring Oscillator  (CRO) PUF for robust cryptographic key generation. The proposed CRO offers the optimal key selection technique to choose the most resilient keys, demonstrating significant resistance against MLMo and DPA attacks. We evaluate CRO PUF’s keys’ resistance against MLMo attacks using six widely used classifier techniques:  Decision Tree  (DT),  Random Forest  (RF),  Support Vector Machine  (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and  Logistic Regression  (LR). The results indicate that the optimal-selected keys can withstand MLMo attacks, achieving extreme resilience, and also show robustness against DPA attacks. The hardware overhead of the CRO PUF is lower than that of other lightweight PUFs, while maintaining resilience against both MLMo and DPA attacks, highlighting its efficiency and lightweight nature.}

The Named Data Networking (NDN) proposes a solution to cache data everywhere along the  routing path  toward data consumers, so we do not need to manually place the data copies. However, its multi-copy cache strategy  wastes storage  space and does not consider remote backup to defense physical hazards. It tends to place backup copies closer to each others, so some copies does not have chance to be accessed and physical hazards can destroy all copies in close geographic location. To address the issue, this paper proposes a Advanced Remote Backup Data System (ARBDS ), which brings erasure coding technology and remote backup concept to distributed storage. The erasure coding can achieve the same reliability at a smaller  storage cost  with less  data redundancy , while remote backup concept protects data from physical hazards. With the consideration on reliability and transmission performance, we design an algorithm named erasure code backup algorithm (ECBA) to find the backup nodes with the 57% shorter average length of routing paths to the consumer compared to existing solutions, provide the 92% higher available bandwidth and keep backup copies far from each other to prevent physical hazards.}

	abstract = {Industrial Controls Systems (ICS) represent a relevant target for attackers. In order to prevent such critical security threats, ICS security assessment activities should be conducted. Conventional vulnerability assessment and penetration testing within ICSs are not practicable due to safety risks and cost constraints. To overcome these challenges, security researchers have developed cybersecurity testbeds. However, these testbeds commonly rely on closed components, cannot be extended, and are very expensive. This research investigates how a modular, open-source framework can enhance the development of robust cybersecurity testbeds and facilitate the implementation of digital twins for securing Industrial Control Systems. We present SCASS, a fully customizable testbed designed to replicate complex SCADA and ICS environments with high fidelity. SCASS addresses the need for accessible, scalable platforms by supporting both physical and virtual components while enabling the evaluation of heterogeneous attack scenarios and security methodologies. By combining advanced attack scenarios with an objective comparative analysis against existing testbeds, SCASS demonstrates its ability to fill critical gaps in the ICS security landscape, fostering collaboration and advancing security assessment methodologies.}

	abstract = {The maritime industry is highly concerned about cybersecurity due to the growing utilisation of digital technologies for navigation and other operations on-board ships. The connectivity of the systems creates vulnerabilities that make crucial ship functions prone to cyber-attacks, such as manipulating  Global Positioning System  (GPS) signals through spoofing. These threats provide substantial risks, particularly while navigating congested waterways. Identifying spoofing attacks requires consistent alertness and sophisticated monitoring from navigation professionals already dealing with demanding workloads. This research comprehensively analyses human reliability, specifically in detecting GPS spoofing on  Electronic Chart  Displays and  Information Systems  (ECDIS) in congested waterways. In order to accomplish this, the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART), as a robust tool, is expanded using the Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach. The HEART provides a comprehensive tool for calculating human error probability, whereas the ER incorporates raters' assessments in decision-making. The research findings indicate that human reliability for detecting GPS spoofing on ECDIS in congested waterways is found to be 6.74E-01. In addition to having practical implications for marine cybersecurity, the suggested technique demonstrates how a thorough understanding of human errors can be obtained. This allows for systematic quantification of the probabilities of human errors associated with identifying spoofing to enhance operational reliability.}

A structured overview of the field is provided through systematic taxonomy for classification of these methods. The survey also considers legal frameworks and institutional policies that often go unnoticed regarding spear phishing prevention by incorporating perspectives from penal jurisprudence and criminology to bridge technical and legal approaches. Other critical challenges that have been identified include changing nature of spear phishing tactics; detection evasion; integration of  artificial intelligence  (AI) into cyber security defenses among others. Henceforth it offers insights into these challenges while proposing  open research  questions aimed at guiding future research initiatives coupled with encouraging collaborations between academia industry policy makers.

	abstract = {In the dynamic landscape of  network security , where cyberattacks continuously evolve, robust and adaptive detection mechanisms are essential, particularly for safeguarding  Internet of Things  (IoT) networks. This paper introduces an advanced  anomaly detection  model that utilizes  Artificial Intelligence  (AI) to identify network anomalies based on traffic features, explaining the most influential factors behind each  detected anomaly . The model integrates domain knowledge stored in a knowledge graph to verify whether the detected anomaly constitutes a legitimate attack. Upon validation, the model identifies which core cybersecurity principles—Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA)—are violated by mapping influential feature values. This is followed by an alignment with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to provide insights into potential attack tactics, techniques, and intelligence-driven countermeasures. By leveraging explainable AI (XAI) and incorporating expert domain knowledge, our approach bridges the gap between complex AI predictions and human-understandable decision-making, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and result  interpretability . This transparency facilitates faster responses and real-time decision-making while improving adaptability to new, unseen cyber threats. Our evaluation on network traffic datasets demonstrates that the model not only excels in detecting and explaining anomalies but also achieves an overall detection accuracy of 0.97 with the integration of domain knowledge for attack legitimacy. Furthermore, it provides 100% accuracy for threat intelligence based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ensuring that security measures are verifiable, actionable, and ultimately strengthen IoT environment defenses by delivering real-time threat intelligence and responses, thus minimizing human response time.}

	abstract = {In light of the growing significance of data privacy in  cloud computing , searchable encryption has emerged as a prominent area of research in recent years. Given that the majority of achievements are only concentrated on keyword-based search, there is a clear need to explore secure semantic extension to enhance the utilization of information. Nevertheless, majority of secure semantic schemes mainly focus on the direct combination of traditional searchable encryption and semantic extension techniques, which results in the high computation and  communication overheads  for multi-keyword queries. Besides, to enhance the flexibility and extensibility of secure  semantic search , some researchers have already proposed  encryption methods  for structured data. However, the effectiveness and practicality of these methods above are often limited by their rigid structure description and redundant index building. To handle these problems, we present a secure sublinear  semantic search  scheme based on the  knowledge graph , which can achieve sublinear  knowledge graph  (KG) search and smart sentence queries concurrently. The knowledge graph encryption index is constructed with the same structure as the inverted index, thereby enabling sublinear efficiency. Furthermore, the system also offers functions for both node and edge semantic extension in the knowledge graph. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is adaptively secure and present a series of experiments to analyze its performance. The experimental results show that our scheme exhibits significant advantages in all computation, communication and expression situations.}

We can solve these difficulties by combining  artificial intelligence  (AL) and  machine learning  (ML) methods. The specifics of the existing security mechanisms and the supply quality define how effective ML-based security systems will be in strengthening such measures. Developing a security system to identify unusual activity and classify threats in the growing complexity and regularity of attacks is essential. This article provides a successful method to identify and classify cyber anomalies. We use a novel method in combination with Stochastic Gradient Boosted Distributed  Decision Trees  (SGB-DDT) with Honeybees Mating Optimisation (HBMO). To improve the detection accuracy, we use SGD-DDT, a  distributed learning  technique that is both highly scalable and effective by combining the collective wisdom of several decision trees. The  SGB  approach's adaptability and error-learning properties make the model less vulnerable to dynamic cyberattacks. The complications of classifying cyberattacks into different types have prompted this research to propose an enhanced HBMO method. The HBMO method aims to improve model performance while reducing processing overhead, which takes inspiration from honeybee mating behaviour. This proposed method, SGB-DDT, can accurately identify several categories of cyberattacks using the enhanced HBMO method. We assess the proposed method using a large and varied dataset of cyberattack incidents from NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, encompassing common and uncommon attack types. The experiment results show that the SGB-DDT with higher HBMO outperforms traditional  ML techniques .}

However, the intensive data exchange underlying their proliferation has raised concerns about interdependent privacy (IDP). This paper investigates the IDP issues of third-party apps that were previously not studied comprehensively. Specifically, first, we analyze the permission structure of multiple app platforms, identifying permissions that have the potential to cause interdependent privacy issues by enabling a user to share someone else’s  personal data  with an app. Second, we collect datasets and characterize the extent to which existing apps request these permissions, revealing the relationship between characteristics such as the respective app platform, the app’s type, and the number of interdependent privacy-related permissions it requests. Third, we analyze why IDP is neglected by both data protection regulations and app platforms and then devise the principles that should be followed when designing a mitigation solution. Finally, based on these principles and satisfying clearly defined objectives, we propose IDPFilter, a platform-agnostic API that enables application providers to minimize collateral information collection by filtering out  data collected  from their users, but implicating others as data subjects. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype, IDPTextFilter, that implements the filtering logic on textual data, and provide its initial performance evaluation concerning privacy, accuracy, and efficiency.}

This paper focuses on enhancing the security of CAN, which currently lack adequate defense mechanisms. We propose integrating Machine Learning-based  Intrusion Detection Systems  (ML-based IDS) into the network to address this vulnerability. However,  ML systems  are susceptible to  adversarial attacks , leading to  misclassification  of data. We introduce three defense combination methods to mitigate this risk: adversarial training,  ensemble learning , and distance-based optimization. Additionally, we employ a  simulated annealing algorithm  in distance-based optimization to optimize the distance moved in  feature space , aiming to minimize intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance. Our results show that the ZOO attack is the most potent adversarial attack, significantly impacting model performance. In terms of model, the basic models achieve an F1 score of 0.99, with  CNN  being the most robust against  adversarial attacks . Under known adversarial attacks, the average F1 score decreases to 0.56. Adversarial training with triplet loss does not perform well, achieving only 0.64, while our defense method attains the highest F1 score of 0.97. For unknown adversarial attacks, the F1 score drops to 0.24, with adversarial training with triplet loss scoring 0.47. Our defense method still achieves the highest score of 0.61. These results demonstrate our method’s excellent performance against known and unknown adversarial attacks.}

While prior research has primarily focused on technological advancements and regulatory enforcement, limited attention has been given to the psychological burden these measures place on employees and the role of organizational strategies in mitigating such challenges. This study bridges this gap by examining how IS role stress and strain, induced by stringent security policies, negatively influence compliance intentions and explores the moderating effects of collaborative communication as a potential solution. Drawing on the Person-Environment Fit model, the study conceptualizes IS role stress through dimensions of conflict and ambiguity and IS role strain through anxiety and fatigue. These constructs were empirically tested using  structural equation modeling  with survey data from 421 employees in organizations with established IS policies. Results reveal that IS role stress significantly increases strain and reduces compliance intentions, while collaborative communication moderates the strain's adverse effects on compliance. The findings emphasize the detrimental impact of poorly integrated security policies, which create stress and strain, ultimately undermining organizational security goals. However, fostering open, rational, and reciprocal communication mitigates these challenges, promoting a supportive environment for compliance. The findings offer actionable strategies for organizations, such as simplifying policy communication, aligning security tasks with work goals, and cultivating collaborative organizational institutions to balance employees’ vocational well-being with robust human-centric security frameworks.}

	abstract = {Adversarial attacks  pose a serious threat to cybersecurity systems, particularly  intrusion detection systems  (IDSs). The property of transferability exacerbates this threat, as attacks designed to fool one IDS model can often fool others in black-box settings. Despite significant efforts to mitigate this property, the impact of feature selection on attack transferability remains unknown. This study investigates adversarial transferability across various  machine learning  (ML) and  deep learning  (DL) models used in IDSs. Two transferability scenarios are investigated: inter-model and intra-model transferability. We trained multiple IDS models, including  support vector machine  (SVM),  random forest  (RF),  decision tree  (DT),  logistic regression  (LR), and  deep neural networks  (DNNs) with different architectures, on feature subsets from various techniques. These IDS models are then subjected to a black-box attack using the zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) method. With the IoT-23 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, we evaluated transferability across different IDS models and feature subsets. The results show significant variations in transferability, with certain feature subsets notably reducing the attack success rate (ASR). Specifically, we recorded a reduction in ASR ranging from 99.9% to 0% depending on the feature subset and the target IDS model. These findings highlight the impact of feature selection on disrupting attack transferability, and suggest that IDS models trained with appropriate feature subsets are more robust to adversarial transferability.}

	abstract = {As networks evolve, their attacks become ever more varied - which creates an increasing variety of features-rich information which models must incorporate during training. However, this data often includes redundant and irrelevant features that impede its effectiveness as an  intrusion detection system . Hybrid Autoencoder- Hybird ResNet-LSTM, an advanced hybrid residual network which combines an innovative hybrid  Autoencoder  with an enhanced LSTM-CNN architecture, was introduced here to enhance detection capabilities of models and identify pertinent feature subsets within datasets more quickly and efficiently. Initial feature selection within the dataset is performed using a modified self-encoder that incorporates  CNN  and GRU components, in order to reduce data dimensionality while pinpointing an optimal subset. This paper assesses a proposed  intrusion detection  model against three datasets commonly used for  intrusion detection  studies: UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and CICIDS-2018. Experimental findings demonstrate high accuracy rates of 95.7%, 94.9% and 96.7% in intrusion detection for NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS-2018 datasets respectively. A comparative analysis with methods proposed by other researchers illustrates how effective our method presented here can be at significantly enhancing intrusion detection accuracy.}

The rise of  IoT  has expanded the  cyber attack  surface, making traditional centralized  machine learning methods  insufficient due to concerns about data availability,  computational resources , transfer costs, and especially  privacy preservation . A semi-supervised  federated learning  model was developed to overcome these issues, combining the Shrink  Autoencoder  and  Centroid  one-class classifier (SAE-CEN). This approach enhances the performance of  intrusion detection  by effectively representing normal network data and accurately identifying anomalies in the decentralized strategy. Additionally, a mean square error-based aggregation algorithm (MSEAvg) was introduced to improve global model performance by prioritizing more accurate local models. The results obtained in our experimental setup, which uses various settings relying on the N-BaIoT dataset and  Dirichlet  distribution, demonstrate significant improvements in real-world heterogeneous  IoT  networks in detection accuracy from 93.98 ± 2.90 to 97.30 ± 0.49, reduced learning costs when requiring only 50% of gateways participating in the training process, and robustness in large-scale networks.}

Managing multiple queries requires amalgamating the privacy loss from each round to determine the overall loss. However, existing composition theorems are limited to specific mechanisms and do not account for query independence. This paper introduces α-Confidence Differential Privacy, a novel mechanism that calculates the minimum privacy loss based on database query events, overcoming mechanism-specific constraints. We formulate a composition theorem for α-Confidence Differential Privacy and develop dynamic privacy loss control through filter and odometer algorithms. Additionally, to address concurrent queries across different mechanisms, we establish an interactive composition theorem and implement corresponding interactive filters and odometers. The simulated experiments demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our approach in the realm of  differential privacy .}

To address these concerns, it is crucial to establish trust between application users and cloud services by exploring the gap of  cloud security  challenges and opportunities in the cybersecurity context. Due to the growing interest in this topic, a comprehensive and updated review of existing literature is much needed. This paper thoroughly examines the current landscape of cloud security, grounded in an extensive systematic literature review of 1,324 research papers, through the lens of a Design Science Research artifact typology rooted in the  Information Systems  domain. The paper makes significant technological contributions to the field of cloud security, by categorizing findings into four artifact types: constructs, models, methods, and  instantiations . These categories are examined across multiple levels of cloud architecture, including data management, identity and access, application and software, host and virtualization, as well as privacy, trust, and compliance. The proposed research framework is adopted to further analyze the challenges that organizations face in securing their cloud-based systems against threats such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks. In addition, the review explores the potential opportunities for enhancing cloud security through the integration of advanced technologies such as  blockchain , zero trust, multi-cloud architecture,  machine learning  and  artificial intelligence , in various domains such as healthcare,  IoT , and smart cities. By providing a critical analysis of the current state of cloud security, this review paper offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with securing cloud-based systems in the cybersecurity era.}

It typically encrypts data in a system, rendering victims unable to decrypt it without the attacker’s private key. Subsequently, victims often pay substantial ransoms to regain access to their data, yet some may still suffer damage or loss. This study examines Rhysida ransomware, which caused significant damage in the second half of 2023, and proposes a decryption method. Rhysida ransomware employed a secure  random number generator  to generate the  encryption keys  for  data encryption . However, a vulnerability in its implementation enabled us to reconstruct the  internal state  of the  random number generator , resulting in the disclosure of the  encryption keys . In a practical time, we successfully decrypted the data infected with Rhysida using the regenerated state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful decryption of data infected by Rhysida. We aim for our findings to contribute to mitigating the harm inflicted by the Rhysida ransomware.}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Segmented Stack Randomization (SSR) scheme, a novel approach that enhances security by randomly allocating stack space across multiple segments during function calls. Designed to operate without additional hardware, the proposed SSR is highly suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments, particularly those requiring predictable execution times for real-time applications. The proposed SSR involves Low  Level Virtual Machine  (LLVM)-based code instrumentation, enabling seamless integration into finalized firmware without introducing debugging complexities. A proof-of-concept implementation on an ARM Cortex-M4 platform demonstrated that SSR provides robust protection against stack-based attacks with minimal performance overhead, averaging  1 . 591 μ s <math><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">1</mn><mo is="true">.</mo><mn is="true">591</mn><mspace width="1em" class="nbsp" is="true"></mspace><mi mathvariant="normal" is="true">μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal" is="true">s</mi></mrow></math> ec per function call.

	abstract = {Compressed sensing  is widely used in various fields. Its reconstruction process is highly complex and time-consuming. For resource-constrained  Internet of Things  (IoT) devices, there are usually not enough computational and storage resources to handle it. The prevalent solution to this problem involves secure outsourcing the compressed sensing reconstruction task to the cloud. Nonetheless, existing privacy-preserving compressed sensing reconstruction protocols are primarily designed based on linear programming, but not applicable to other reconstruction methods. In these protocols, the computational cost on the user and the cloud is still high. To tackle these issues, we design a privacy-preserving compressed sensing reconstruction protocol specifically tailored for IoT applications. Different from existing works, our proposed protocol can be applicable to all reconstruction algorithms. It allows the cloud flexibly choose the appropriate signal reconstruction method. The proposed protocol directly encrypts the reconstruction problem. In the  ciphertext  state, the reconstruction problem is transformed into other forms of the problem for solving. We use a signal obfuscation method for encryption in the proposed protocol. The user no longer needs to perform matrix multiplication calculations for encryption, saving a lot of computational resources. Our proposed protocol not only ensures the client privacy by preventing data leakage to cloud but also effectively reduces computational complexity for both the user and the cloud. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness and security of the protocol and experimentally verify its feasibility.}

	abstract = {The increasing sophistication of multi-faceted attacks (MFAs) presents significant challenges for securing  Internet of Things  (IoT) networks, where traditional defenses and even contemporary solutions often fail to provide comprehensive protection. Current frameworks in the literature face critical limitations such as centralized control architectures that are prone to bottlenecks and  single points of failure , inadequate  traffic monitoring  capabilities, and limited adaptability to dynamic attack surfaces. These gaps make IoT environments vulnerable to stealthy, coordinated, and complex attacks that can simultaneously target multiple layers of the network. Addressing these challenges requires a more dynamic and distributed approach to security. This paper introduces CO-STOP, an innovative framework designed to overcome these limitations by integrating  machine learning  (ML), the P4 programming language, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and a novel multi-control design (MCD). CO-STOP enhances IoT network management by distributing both detection and mitigation efforts across  multiple controllers , improving scalability and resilience. It also addresses the shortcomings of existing solutions by incorporating adaptive  traffic monitoring  and a distributed  mitigation strategy  that reduces the risks of network disruption. The framework comprises four interconnected modules: (1) Authenticated Dynamic Multi-Control (ADMC), which introduces secure, synchronized controller collaboration; (2) P4-Enabled Adaptive Traffic Monitoring (P4-ATM), leveraging programmable state tables for real-time traffic analysis; (3) Multi-Faceted Attack Detection and Prevention (MFADP), employing a Dynamic Meta-Ensemble with Confidence-Based Prioritization (DMECP) for accurate attack detection; and (4) P4-Enabled Multi-Control Adaptive Mitigation (P4-MCAM), which distributes mitigation efforts across  multiple controllers . CO-STOP demonstrates significant resource efficiency, with the P4-based solution reducing bandwidth consumption by 27%, memory usage by 19%, and CPU utilization by 21% compared to the OpenFlow-based approach. Experiments reveal that the proposed multi-controller architecture consistently outperforms the single-controller design across six key  evaluation metrics . CO-STOP sets new benchmarks in SD-IoT security, achieving 99.25% accuracy, a 98.83% F1-score, and a low false positive rate of 0.51%. By addressing both the limitations of existing frameworks and the critical need for scalable, efficient, and adaptive security solutions, CO-STOP represents a substantial advancement in safeguarding SD-IoT networks from emerging attacks.}

As the design and execution of cyber threats generally is costly, researchers and practitioners have developed threat emulators that automate cyber threats without the need for human intervention. The ability of these emulators to produce threats useful for cyber defence exercises is, however, uncertain. This paper presents an evaluation of the automated threat emulator Lore using  data collected  from three cyber defence exercises. During the exercises, Lore and human threat agents (often called the “red” team) subjected 132  network security  analysts (often called the “blue” team) to various threats such as software exploits and shell commands. Six hypotheses related to how the actions by human red teams and Lore were perceived and managed by the security analysts were examined. Evaluations were made by studying the subjective judgments of the analysts as well as by comparing the objective ground truth to their submitted incident reports. The results show that the security analysts could not tell the difference between the actions made by the human red team and those made by Lore, and that their performance was similar regardless of the source of the threats.}

Despite some evidence of higher accident rates in AVs, these incidents tend to result in less severe injuries compared to traditional vehicles due to cooperative safety measures. However, the increased complexity of CAV systems exposes them to significant  security vulnerabilities , potentially compromising their performance and communication integrity. This paper contributes by presenting a detailed analysis of existing security frameworks and protocols, focusing on intra- and inter-vehicle communications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these frameworks in addressing known vulnerabilities and propose a set of best practices for enhancing CAV communication security. The paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors in CAV ecosystems and suggests future research directions for designing more robust security mechanisms. Our key contributions include the development of a new classification system for CAV security threats, the proposal of practical  security protocols , and the introduction of use cases that demonstrate how these protocols can be integrated into real-world CAV applications. These insights are crucial for advancing secure CAV adoption and ensuring the safe integration of autonomous vehicles into  intelligent transportation systems .}

In this paper, by utilizing a mathematical model that reflects the dominant features of  DDoS attacks  we will introduce how to explore an approach in countering its effects. We propose a closed loop  time delay  feedback control (CLTD-FC) system by designing an appropriate  feedback controller . This infrastructure is in turn exploited to design a control theoretic  mitigation strategy  that effectively dampens the queue dynamics of internet routers during  DDoS  scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that the CLTD-FC scheme appropriately maintains and monitors queue stability whilst simultaneously enabling convergence to desired operational targets under continual attacks. The method is implemented in the  network simulator  platform NS2 to validate its proposed effectiveness. Simulation results show that the proposed CLTD-FC scheme can help to improve  QoS , ensure network fairness as well as stabilize and optimize queue performance compared with Drop-tail solution.}

	abstract = {Software vulnerabilities shared and discussed on  social media platforms  alert malicious users about the existence of vulnerabilities and increase the risk of exploits. In this study, we build a hazard model to explain the effect of social media exposure of software vulnerabilities on vendors’ behavior towards releasing patches. We collect data from multiple sources, including the United States  Computer Emergency Readiness Team  (US-CERT), the National  Vulnerability Database , vendor websites, and Twitter. The results suggest that social media exposure, measured as retweet count, accelerates releasing the patches for immediately disclosed vulnerabilities. Patches are further expedited if the tweets discuss the root-cause or exploit details. Vulnerabilities shared by credible sources are patched faster. Additionally, vulnerability characteristics, such as a higher impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability and a higher severity level, lead to faster patches. Finally, vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely are patched faster. Overall, our findings illustrate that social media exposure exacerbates the pressure on vendors to release patches quickly. Thus, policymakers and discoverers can use social media as a tool to further influence vendor behavior in socially desirable ways.}

	abstract = {Patching software become overwhelming for system administrators due to the large amounts of patch releases. Administrator should prioritize security patches to reduce the exposure to attacks, and can use for this task the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system, which catalogs known  security vulnerabilities  in publicly released software or firmware. However, some developers choose to omit CVE publication and merely update their repositories, keeping the vulnerabilities undisclosed. Such actions leave users uninformed and potentially at risk. To this end, we present PatchView, an innovative multi-modal system tailored for the classification of commits as security patches. The system draws upon three unique data modalities associated with a commit: (1) Time-series representation of developer behavioral data within the Git repository, (2) Commit messages, and (3) The code patches. PatchView merges three single-modality sub-models, each adept at interpreting data from its designated source. A distinguishing feature of this solution is its ability to elucidate its predictions by examining the outputs of each sub-model, underscoring its  interpretability . Notably, this research pioneers a language-agnostic methodology for security patch classification. Our evaluations indicate that the proposed solution can reveal concealed security patches with an accuracy of 94.52% and F1-scoreof 95.12%. The code for this paper will be made publicly available on GitHub:  https://github.com/nitzanfarhi/PatchView .}

	abstract = {The emergence of smartphones and internet accessibility around the globe have enabled billions of people to be connected to the digital world. Due to the popularity of  instant messaging  applications and social media, a large quantity of  personal data  is in text format, and processing text data in a privacy-preserving manner poses unique challenges. While existing reviews focus on privacy concerns from specific algorithmic perspectives or target only a particular domain, such as healthcare or smart metering, they fail to provide a comprehensive view that addresses the multi-layered privacy risks inherent to text data processing. Existing works often limit their scope to specialized solutions like  differential privacy ,  anonymization , or  federated learning , neglecting a broader spectrum of challenges. To fill this gap, we present a comprehensive review of privacy-enhancing solutions for text data processing in the present literature and classify the works into six categories of privacy risks: (i) unintentional memorability, (ii) membership inference, (iii) exposure and re-identification, (iv)  language models  and  word embeddings , (v)  authorship attribution , and (vi) collaborative processing. We then analyze existing privacy-enhancing solutions for text data by considering the aforementioned privacy risks. Finally, we identified several research gaps, including the need for comprehensive privacy metrics, explainable algorithms, and privacy in  social media analytics .}
