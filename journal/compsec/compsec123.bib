	abstract = {Our previous work has proposed an approach and a tool supporting it, called Invariant Proof Score Generator (IPSG), that can automatically generate formal proofs, called proof scores, for formal verification of invariant properties. In this work, we present some improvements of the tool that are helpful when conducting formal verification in practice. We demonstrate the practicability of the tool with the TLS 1.2 Handshake Protocol, which is one of the most important cryptographic protocols in use today, securing numerous internet communications. We formally verify that the protocol enjoys two properties including the secrecy property and the authentication property by employing IPSG to infer proof scores. TLS is much more complex than academic protocols, and hence, through the case study, the practicability of the tool is confirmed. Moreover, the correctness of the generated proof scores is once more verified with the use of two extensions of CafeInMaude - a CafeOBJ interpreter implemented in Maude, ensuring that there is not any subtle error in the proof scores generated by our tool. In addition to the case studies reported in our previous work as well as the TLS case study presented in this paper, we also report experimental results of the tool with several other protocols.}

	abstract = {Nowadays the wide application of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) has promoted the rapid development of new intelligence fields. However, the inference of complex CNN usually includes a large number of computational operations. It is hard for the resource-limited user to complete the complicated CNN inference by his own. Privacy-preserving convolution neural network inference schemes allow the user to leverage the edge/cloud server to complete CNN inference under the condition that the privacy is protected. Nevertheless, existing schemes either require time-consuming cryptographic techniques, such as secure multi-party computing and homomorphic encryption, or fail to protect the privacy of the trained CNN model. To address this problem, we propose a novel privacy-preserving CNN inference scheme with edge-assistance. In this scheme, the privacy of the input data and the trained model is well protected and no complex cryptographic technique is involved. We blind the data to be predicted and the trained model to the edge servers, and then the edge servers calculate the most time-consuming layers. The user only deals with computationally efficient layers, fast encryption and recovery. Analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient, which obviously saves the computational overhead of the user.}

	abstract = {While recent research on intelligent transportation systems including vehicular communication systems has focused on technical aspects, little research work has been conducted on drivers’ privacy perceptions and preferences. Understanding the driver’s privacy perceptions and preferences will allow researchers to design usable privacy and identity management systems offering user privacy choices and controls for intelligent transportation systems. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 Swedish drivers to analyse their privacy perceptions and preferences for intelligent transportation systems, particularly for user control and for privacy trade-offs with cost, safety and usability. We also compare our results from the interviews with Swedish drivers with results from interviews that we conducted previously with South African drivers. Our cross-cultural comparison shows that perceived privacy implications, the drivers’ willingness to share location information under certain conditions with other parties, as well as their appreciation of Privacy Enhancing Technologies differ significantly across drivers with different cultural backgrounds. We further discuss the cultural impact on privacy preferences, including those for privacy trade-offs, and the implications of our results for usable privacy-enhancing Identity Management for future vehicular communication systems. In particular, we provide recommendations for suitable pre-defined privacy options to be offered to users with different cultural backgrounds enabling them to easily make privacy-related control choices.}

In this paper, we offer a fresh perspective on the IoT security landscape by providing a full list of reported vulnerabilites. By organizing protocols and vulnerabilities according to the TCP/IP stack, we guide both novice and expert users and developers in gaining a clear overview of the state-of-the-art IoT and its security issues.

However, there are far more unlabeled samples in the application scenario, while most studies must depend on labeled data for training. This paper proposed, as a solution, a framework based on contrastive learning that attempted to reduce the impact of past knowledge and pretrain the model without the participation of labels. The result indicated that the method could reach an accuracy above 96% for malware identification on public datasets and above 98% for multiclass detection (malware class and family). In addition, the model could have higher performance than the same supervised model under the condition of a small proportion of labeled samples. Comparable performance to supervised approaches validated the feasibility of contrastive learning on malware detection by demonstrating its viability. Nonetheless, there are still gaps to be overcome in the future.}

	abstract = {The amalgamation of Smart IoT and Machine learning is an emerging research area. In this context, a new trend in IoT called Social IoT has been considered for this study. The Social IoT has benefits of connectivity exhibited within the network of connected objects through the Internet of Things (IoT). It covers the entire world and provides innovative services to improve life standards, establishes novel businesses, and makes buildings and cities. Certain smart things allow the collection of ubiquitous data or traffic, which pose a threat to source location privacy. Therefore, it limits the source of the Internet of Things vision if implemented wrongly. These threats come along with some challenges, adversary profiles, and the location privacy of personal data. When they are used to monitor important assets, the attacker can easily hunt the location of these assets. However, the source location constitutes a way to prevent the adversary from finding the location of the source. This research has used a hybrid phantom method by combining the phantom node and multi-path route that improves privacy and reduces the consumption of energy. The Analytic Hierarchal Process (AHP) is used for phantom node selection, based on parameters such as energy, distance, heterogeneity, and neighbor list. The result shows the average consistency value of the parameters is 4.2 and the consistency index value is 0.066. The overall priority of the alternative node is 2.089 as compared to other nodes. The sum of the vector weight value is obtained as 4.845. The total average energy consumption is 1.211 J and the average safety period capture ratio is 59.41%. The proposed techniques overwhelmed the deficiencies in existing techniques, reduces energy consumption improves the safety period and increases the network lifetime.}

	abstract = {Rapid development and adaptation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created new problems for securing these interconnected devices and networks. There are hundreds of thousands of IoT devices with underlying security vulnerabilities, such as insufficient device authentication/authorisation making them vulnerable to malware infection. IoT botnets are designed to grow and compete with one another over unsecure devices and networks. Once infected, the device will monitor a Command-and-Control (C&C) server indicating the target of an attack via Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. These security issues, coupled with the continued growth of IoT, presents a much larger attack surface for attackers to exploit in their attempts to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to networks, systems, and data. Large datasets available online provide good benchmarks for the development of accurate solutions for botnet detection, however model training is often a time-consuming process. Interestingly, significant advancement of GPU technology allows shortening the time required to train such large and complex models. This paper presents a methodology for the pre-processing of the IoT-Bot dataset and classification of various attack types included. We include descriptions of pre-processing actions conducted to prepare data for training and a comparison of results achieved with GPU accelerated versions of Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression classifiers from the cuML library. Using our methodology, the best-trained models achieved at least 0.99 scores for accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. Moreover, the application of feature selection and training models on GPU significantly reduced the training and estimation times.}

	abstract = {With the continuous occurrence of cybersecurity incidents, network intrusion detection has become one of the most critical issues in cyber ecosystems. Although previous machine learning-based approaches have made significant progress, their generalization ability is limited due to the following critical challenges. First, intrusion detection is severely affected by the class imbalance problem in many network scenarios, with some attack types representing only a very small subset of the entire training set. Second, cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and hence, it is becoming more challenging for existing methods to extract robust representations. Third, most existing methods generally leverage only a particular aspect of the network traffic features and treat model training as a single-task learning problem, thus ignoring the discriminative ability of different feature types and the performance enhancement of integrating multiple machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-task lEarning Model with hyBrid dEep featuRes (MEMBER) to address the aforementioned challenges. Based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with embedded spatial and channel attention mechanisms, MEMBER innovatively introduces two auxiliary tasks (i.e., an auto-encoder (AE) enhanced with a memory module and a distance-based prototype network) to boost the model generalization ability and alleviate the performance degradation suffered in imbalanced network environments. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed MEMBER in terms of both F1 score and stability.}

	abstract = {Today, leveraging the enormous modular power, diversity and flexibility of manycore systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) requires careful orchestration of complex and heterogeneous resources, a task left to low-level software, e.g., hypervisors. In current architectures, this software forms a single point of failure and worthwhile target for attacks: once compromised, adversaries can gain access to all information and full control over the platform and the environment it controls. This article proposes Midir, an enhanced manycore architecture, effecting a paradigm shift from SoCs to distributed SoCs. Midir changes the way platform resources are controlled, by retrofitting tile-based fault containment through well known mechanisms, while securing low-overhead quorum-based consensus on all critical operations, in particular privilege management and, thus, management of containment domains. Allowing versatile redundancy management, Midir promotes resilience for all software levels, including at low level. We explain this architecture, its associated algorithms and hardware mechanisms and show, for the example of a Byzantine fault tolerant microhypervisor, that it outperforms the highly efficient MinBFT by one order of magnitude.}

In recent years, machine learning (ML) technology has been increasingly used in NIDS, increasing detection accuracy and aggravating network evasion risk. In order to detect the robustness of existing anomaly detection algorithms based on ML, we design and implement a black box attack method to evade network intrusion detection in this paper. The method includes two parts: first, we apply the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) features to generate adversarial samples to generate data packets that can evade anomaly detection. Then, we insert the forged data packets into the original malicious traffic so that the anomaly detectors cannot detect the malicious traffic. We test on the latest intrusion detection datasets. Experimental results show that this method has a good evasion effect on all tested anomaly detectors, and the evasion rate of half of the anomaly detectors exceeds 90%. Through experiments, we find that the feature extraction of the existing anomaly detection algorithm has a loophole, so we propose a new defense model to make up for this loophole. Experiments confirm that the model can significantly reduce the evasion rate.}

To trust AI systems with such tasks, a high degree of confidence in their behaviour is needed. However, such systems can make drastically different decisions if the input data is modified, in a way that would be imperceptible to humans. The field of Adversarial Machine Learning studies how this feature could be exploited by an attacker and the countermeasures to defend against them. This work examines the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM) attack, a novel Single Value attack and the Label Flip attack on a trending architecture, namely a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model used for time series classification. The results show that the architecture was susceptible to these attacks and that, in their face, the classifier accuracy was significantly impacted.}

	abstract = {Feature selection has become significantly important for data analysis. It selects the most informative features describing the data to filter out the noise, complexity, and over-fitting caused by less relevant features. Accordingly, feature selection improves the predictors’ accuracy, enables them to be trained faster and more cost-effectively, and provides a better understanding of the underlying data. While plenty of practical solutions have been proposed in the literature to identify the most discriminating features describing a dataset, an understanding of feature selection over privacy-sensitive data in the absence of a trusted party is still missing. The design of such a framework is specifically important in our modern society, where each individual through accessing the Internet can play simultaneously the role of a data provider and a data-analysis beneficiary. In this study, we propose a novel feature selection framework based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP), named LDP-FS, which estimates the importance of features over securely protected data while protects the confidentiality of each individual data before leaving the user’s device. The performance of LDP-FS in terms of scoring and ordering the features is assessed by investigating the impact of datasets properties, privacy mechanism, privacy levels, and feature selection techniques on this framework. The accuracy of classifiers trained on the selected subset of features by LDP-FS is also presented. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) programmes leverage a global network of independent security researchers (hackers) to support pre- and post-deployment security. Organisations are increasingly adopting Bug Bounty Programmes (BBPs) and Vulnerability Disclosure Programmes (VDPs) to outsource work from internal security teams, and are able to utilise the results from a programme to help shape their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes. Motivated by the question How effectively are organisations utilising CVD programmes?, we aim to address two issues concerning the operation of CVD programmes. First, it is necessary to identify the pre- and post-launch issues faced by programme operators that inhibit effective operation. Second, organisations stand to benefit if they are able to use the results of a CVD programme outside of the typical reporting-triaging information flow between a hacker and the operator. As such, it is useful to explore how the results of a CVD programme influence change across the SDLCs of real-world organisations and measure the extent to which this occurs. We report upon the results of a qualitative study based on the outcomes of 39 survey responses and eight semi-structured interviews with individuals involved in the operation of CVD programmes. It is found that the fears and issues faced by organisations are similar to those identified in earlier studies, suggesting that there has been little development in preventing prevalent problems faced by CVD programme operators. High volumes of low-quality, low-value reports still burden operators and consume resources. It is also found that organisations use the information contained within vulnerability reports to influence change in a number of security activities, namely testing, communication processes, and the specification of security requirements. Finally, based on the responses from the surveys and interviews, we provide recommendations to those looking to establish a CVD programme.}

	abstract = {Lack of personalisation and poor mechanics (e.g., grammar, spelling and punctuation) are commonly cited as cues of deception that people can use to identify phishing emails. However, in an online email classification experiment (N = 472), we found no empirical evidence that the presence of these features was associated with better phishing email discrimination. We also manipulated time pressure and found that it significantly reduced detection accuracy. Participants rarely inspected the URLs associated with links in the phishing emails but, when they did, their detection performance improved. Better performance in distinguishing between genuine and phishing emails was linked to lower levels of an intuitive decision-making style and relatively lower education levels amongst a highly educated sample. Older participants and those with greater computer proficiency and stronger email habit showed a slight increase in tendency to judge emails as suspicious. The results are discussed in terms of intervention strategies such as cyber security training to improve resilience to phishing attacks.}

	abstract = {Through a built-in security analysis feature based on metadata, this article provides a novel framework that starts with a scenario input and produces a collection of visualizations based on Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Standards. It immediately links enterprise mitigations from MITRE ATT&CK framework to the security flaws it discovered. It’s also integrated with a third-party optimization tool targeted at cutting security costs for businesses, which it can perform in real-time or later using JSON output in the preferred format, depending on the execution mode. All of these stages are conducted without human intervention. Adaptive metadata with a variety of rules for capturing different sorts of known or prospective attack types allows for the production of attack graphs. It can be used as a quick and practical what-if analysis tool to detect potential intrusions for a variety of network configuration setups and assigned access privileges. As a threat modeler, it is suitable for both novice and expert users. Due to the easy input scheme and human-readable outputs, it can also be utilized as an educational tool.}

	abstract = {Interconnectivity has become a substratum of technology as the benefits of data-driven functionality are being realized in nearly all industries. Increased connectivity of Operational Technology (OT) exacerbates cyber risks because Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are becoming exposed to the Internet. These exposures are often done inadvertently through misconfigurations as additional network devices come online. Attack surface management (ASM) platforms can be used to identify vulnerabilities by performing external network discovery over the Internet using web spiders. These web spiders enable big data analytics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as identifiable information of Internet-exposed equipment are archived in searchable databases that are made publicly available. There are a multitude of ASM service providers on the market. This study was conducted to evaluate several commonly known tools to determine the aggregate attack surface of control systems. Queries were crafted by targeting commonly known manufacturers and communication protocols found in OT networks. Identified devices were that categorized based on technology types. Each query was replicated between several tools to target identical ICS equipment. Findings in this paper suggested a significant variance in the exposures discovered by each tool, but unique contributions were identified for each tool when a merged attack surface was derived. Therefore, all tools should be used in aggregate.}

	abstract = {As the amount of traffic on the Internet increases, so does the number of new and sophisticated network attacks. Intrusion detection systems are the most important tools for accurate detection of potential threats. Due to the dynamic nature of network attacks, deep learning neural networks play a significant role in intrusion detection, as they have proven to be effective in processing large amounts of data. However, deep learning networks often have difficulties to effectively detect attack classes that are in minority, when trained with imbalanced cybersecurity data. The common way to deal with this difficulty is resampling. In contrast to resampling, in this paper we implement Deep Neural Network for intrusion detection varying its parameters, and analyze detection performances of minority classes in imbalanced multi-class data. The model is trained and tested on the CICIDS-2017 dataset, which contains almost 3 million records and 15 traffic classes, where some classes are in extreme minority, holding only a few records per class. Additionally, the model was evaluated on an also imbalanced CICIDS-2018 dataset. Two feature selection methods are performed on the preprocessed data, in order to obtain two different feature subsets. Our findings show that some coarse grained features are of such significance that attacks with only 3 instances can be completely and accurately detected. As a conclusion, we show the difference in feature characteristics for minority classes that are crucial for their detection.}

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems are becoming more susceptible to cyber intrusion, compromising the critical infrastructure of the smart grid. This emerging concern requires the urgent help of researchers to find a practical and better approach to secure an intelligent power grid against cyber-attack. This research article proposes a "Statistical Machine Learning Defensive Mechanism (SML-DM)" for Smart Grid Cyber-Physical Networks (SGCPN) against cyber intrusion by using a Gaussian mixture model merged with wireless sensor data. Using SML-DM, two new indices are proposed to evaluate the performance of the defensive mechanism. The first index, Data Prediction Error (DPE), calculates actual and predicted data errors during a cyber-attack. The second index, Sensor Reliability Score (SRS), is used to assess the reliability status of wireless sensors. MATLAB software was used to validate this research, and data was taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Using the proposed defence mechanism, it is found that the data integrity and reliability of the sensors can increase by up to 90%.}

	abstract = {The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples has attracted more attention. Many algorithms have been proposed to craft powerful adversarial examples. However, most of these algorithms modified the global or local region of pixels without taking network explanations into account. Hence, the perturbations are redundant, which are easily detected by human eyes. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate local region perturbations. The main idea is to find a contributing feature region (CFR) of an image by simulating the human attention mechanism and then add perturbations to CFR. Furthermore, a soft mask matrix is designed on the basis of an activation map to finely represent the contributions of each pixel in CFR. With this soft mask, we develop a new loss function with inverse temperature to search for optimal perturbations in CFR. Due to the network explanations, the perturbations added to CFR are more effective than those added to other regions. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC2012 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including attack success rate, imperceptibility, and transferability.}

	abstract = {The studies on black-box and evolutionary algorithm-based adversarial attacks have become increasingly popular due to the intractable acquisition of the structural knowledge of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the performance of these emerging attacks is negatively impacted when fooling DNNs tailored for high-resolution images. One of the explanations is that they usually focus on attacking the entire image, regardless of its spatial semantic information, and thereby encounter the notorious curse of dimensionality. To this end, we propose a pixel skipping and evolutionary algorithm-based attentional black-box adversarial attack, termed PISA. In PISA, only one of every two neighboring pixels in the salient region is recognized as the target by leveraging the attention map and pixel skipping, such that the dimension of the black-box attack reduces. After that, PISA allows the embedding of an arbitrary multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, which is employed to traverse the reduced pixels and finally generates effective perturbations that are imperceptible by human vision. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed PISA is more competitive in attacking high-resolution images than existing black-box and evolutionary algorithm-based attacks.}

Even if Machine Learning (ML) models are used to find anomalies, they need to be regularly trained/updated to avoid becoming outdated. In an evolving environment, a ML model with outdated training might put at risk the organization it was supposed to defend.}
