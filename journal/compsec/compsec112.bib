	abstract = {As a promising centralized control architecture, software-defined network (SDN) has been widely used and developed in the field of optical access network. Though, its centralized control architecture has many advantages, it is also hindered by various security threats. Among all the threats, the attack, Denial-of-Service (DoS) is the most severe attack into the software defined optical network (SDON). In spite of, so many developments in tools and technology, there are few effective schemes to detect denial of service attacks in SDON. In our research work, we proposed a traffic anomaly detection scheme by analyzing and defining the specific security threat non-directional denial of service attack (ND-DoS) faced by the SDON. In this scheme, we first designed the function construction of the controller and the extension of the OpenFlow protocol, and then used the adaptive threshold detection algorithm based on time sliding window (TSW-ATD) and the repeated flow detection algorithm (RFD) to complete the first detection and re-detection detection of abnormal traffic, and finally designed a general formulaic measurement method. The proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the existing related solutions, the forwarding success rate of this scheme is increased by about 29.4%, the data processing rate in the unit window is increased by about 39.3%, and the CPU occupancy rate is reduced by about 17.5%. Therefore, this scheme can effectively deal with DoS attacks in SDON with a higher detection rate and lower resource overhead.}

	abstract = {The cosmic evolution of the Internet of things (IoTs) in par with its realization in all spheres of life undertakings, mandates continuous research pursuits in IoT and its associated components. While the rapid evolution of IoTs has facilitated monumental opportunities for humanity, it has also acted as a catalyst precipitating diverse security issues. Cybercrimes have been on the rise as criminals and hackers continue to take advantage of IoT's security loopholes and vulnerabilities. The enormity of the attacks has not only been damaging to the quality of life, but it poses a disservice and an unquantifiable risk to human safety. Thus, a timely and comprehensive review, analysis and investigation of the security of IoTs is crucial. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the latest findings and trends to provide new insights into the security of IoTs, taking cognizant of its social, economic, technical and legal implications, which will be beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, individuals, organizations, and governments. Although many studies reviewing the state of IoT exist in the literature, no studies shape the area of its security well. Hence, there is currently no study that provides an in-depth survey of the emerging security concerns of IoT from diverse perspectives and in tandem with the current condition of the global world today. Compared to other related reviews on the security of IoTs, this survey encompasses much more technical angles to the security of IoT. It begins with the review of the concept of IoTs, the assessments of its industrial development trends, revolutionary paradigms and updated security of the IoT. Key challenges in the security of blockchain technology, a recent spike in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic are sensitive areas that have remained untouched by previous review works. Additionally, politics and security of electoral votes, forensic issues in the IoT era and much more are some of the new depths missing in the literature of IoT security. Thus, a huge divide in the total adoption and actualization of IoT in diverse areas of human endeavour. This review formalizes the IoT concept, illuminating deep insights into possible solutions to the heterogeneous nature of IoT's security challenges, emerging issues, gaps, opportunities, foresight, and recommendations.}

	abstract = {Human-machine interaction is increasingly dependent on speech communication, mainly due to the remarkable performance of Machine Learning models in speech recognition tasks. However, these models can be fooled by adversarial examples, which are inputs intentionally perturbed to produce a wrong prediction without the changes being noticeable to humans. While much research has focused on developing new techniques to generate adversarial perturbations, less attention has been given to aspects that determine whether and how the perturbations are noticed by humans. This question is relevant since high fooling rates of proposed adversarial perturbation strategies are only valuable if the perturbations are not detectable. In this paper we investigate to which extent the distortion metrics proposed in the literature for audio adversarial examples, and which are commonly applied to evaluate the effectiveness of methods for generating these attacks, are a reliable measure of the human perception of the perturbations. Using an analytical framework, and an experiment in which 36 subjects evaluate audio adversarial examples according to different factors, we demonstrate that the metrics employed by convention are not a reliable measure of the perceptual similarity of adversarial examples in the audio domain.}

	abstract = {Like many cyber security domains, data availability influences many active decisions and research trajectories in the advanced persistent threat (APT) landscape. Current solutions relying on many temporal constrains have limited generalization for new threats. In this paper, these two challenges are addressed, whereby we introduce domain adaptation to broaden the availability of data to improve APT detection while determining the relevance of separating samples based on their reported use. With the ability to introduce new data, namely in the APT-Executable (APT-EXE) dataset, we propose a new method to adapt over 4500 APT malware log samples to our target domain and achieve superior detection performance. A combination of transductive and inductive adaptation is applied by adapting the distribution of APT file system interaction. Adaptation is applied to retrieve system driven access and usage structure and functionality interaction footprints. The aligned distribution of log entries is projected within a Riemannian manifold. A weighted geodesics distance between APT samples and unseen log entries is measured, and APT driven Bayes net (APT-BN) is probed for queries for respective techniques respectively for adaptation and footprint methods. The proposed method is evaluated on 183 different Windows APT samples for 207 processes from 20 documented APT campaigns 2018 and onward. Comparisons are made based on the proposed method, multiple state-of-the-art log embedding techniques, and established text processing techniques. The proposed method outperforms all techniques in reducing false positives to less than 100 in 100,000 processes and a true positive rate of 0.80%. Thus, domain adaptation methods are promising to mitigate the challenges of detecting APTs.}

	abstract = {As an ill-posed problem, median filtered (MF) image restoration and anti-forensics still face a challenge in improving the visual quality and deceiving the forensic detectors simultaneously. MF image restoration mainly aims at image visual quality recovery, while MF image anti-forensics primarily focuses on deceiving the existing forensic algorithms. Median filtering is popularly used as an operation for image denoising and smoothing. It is also employed by image anti-forensics to conceal or remove the traces of other image manipulating operations, such as JPEG blocking artifacts and the periodicity introduced by image resampling. This work proposes an adversarial learning framework that introduces loss terms spanning three domains for MF image restoration and anti-forensics. The differences of high-frequency coefficients in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain are introduced as a term of loss term to restore high-frequency components. Moreover, high-frequency subband variance loss in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain is proposed to make the statistical characteristics of the generated image closer to that of the original image. Together with the Huber loss in the spatial domain, a novel generator network is developed and trained to enhance information flow and feature reuse. A capsule network is applied as a discriminator for differentiating the generated image from the original version. We explore a solution through adversarial learning in an infinite set of possible solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to restore the visual quality of MF images with salt and pepper noise previously more effectively than the existing methods. What is more, our method achieves the best anti-forensic performance in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art MF image anti-forensic methods, while enhancing the quality of anti-forensically restored images.}

	abstract = {The explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is an inevitable trend, especially considering the fact that 5G technology facilitates numerous services building on IoT devices. IoT devices deliver great convenience to our daily lives; nevertheless, they are becoming attractive attacking targets. Compromised IoT devices can result in the exposure of user privacy, damage to network security, or even threats to personal safety. In a rush for convenience and marketability, the security of these devices is usually less considered during production and even ignored. Under these circumstances, Remote Attestation (RA) becomes a valuable security service. It outsources the computation and verification burden to a resource-rich party, e.g., server, to ease its on-device implementation, making it suitable for protocol extensions.}

	abstract = {In recent times, Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have become very popular for detecting intrusions in computer networks. Existing NIDSs can easily identify those intrusions that have been frequently witnessed in the network (majority attacks), but they cannot identify new and infrequent intrusions (minority attacks) accurately. Moreover, such systems solely focus on maximizing the overall Attack Detection Rate while overlooking the number of false alarms. To address these issues, this paper proposes CSE-IDS, a three-layer NIDS, based on Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning and Ensemble algorithms. Layer 1 of the proposed CSE-IDS uses Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Network to separate normal traffic from suspicious network traffic. These suspicious samples are then sent to Layer 2, which uses the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to classify them into normal class, different majority attack classes, and a single class representing all minority attack classes. At last, Random Forest is used at Layer 3 to classify the minority attacks identified at Layer 2 into their respective classes. The performance of the proposed CSE-IDS was evaluated on the NSL-KDD, CIDDS-001, and CICIDS2017 datasets with respect to Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC values, and computational times. The proposed system outperforms its counterparts by achieving a high Attack Detection Rate for both majority attacks and minority attacks present in the network. Further, it minimizes the number of false alarms by correctly segregating normal traffic from attack traffic. The obtained results confirm that the proposed CSE-IDS can be deployed in the real world for performing network-based intrusion detection.}

	abstract = {AntiViruses (AVs) are the main defense line against attacks for most users and much research has been done about them, especially proposing new detection procedures that work in academic prototypes. However, as most current and commercial AVs are closed-source solutions, in practice, little is known about their real internals: information such as what is a typical AV database size, the detection methods effectively used in each operation mode, and how often on average the AVs are updated are still unknown. This prevents research work from meeting the industrial practices more thoroughly. To fill this gap, in this work, we systematize the knowledge about AVs. To do so, we first surveyed the literature and identified existing knowledge gaps in AV internals’ working. Further, we bridged these gaps by analyzing popular (Windows, Linux, and Android) AV solutions to check their operations in practice. Our methodology encompassed multiple techniques, from tracing to fuzzing. We detail current AV’s architecture, including their multiple components, such as browser extensions and injected libraries, regarding their implementation, monitoring features, and self-protection capabilities. We discovered, for instance, a great disparity in the set of API functions hooked by the distinct AV’s libraries, which might have a significant impact in the viability of academically-proposed detection models (e.g., machine learning-based ones).}

Detectors that use only one type of feature have been studied a lot, but what uses both features is rarely investigated, although good performance might be expected due to their complementary characteristics. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep generative model that exploits global and local features together to detect the malware variants effectively. While transforming malware into an image to efficiently represent global features with pre-defined latent space, it extracts local features using the binary code sequences. The two features extracted from the data with their respective characteristics are concatenated and entered into the malware detector. By using both features, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 97.47%, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance. We analyze what parts of the malware code affect the results of detection through a class activation map (CAM) and confirm the usefulness by analyzing the CAM results of the generated malware that virtual malware generation improves detection performance.}

	abstract = {As cybersecurity incidents increase and become more potent, affected companies must react. This is especially relevant for data breaches, where companies are legally required to notify those affected. Hence, it can be assumed that data breaches invariably cause damage through disappointed customers and dissatisfied investors. By applying response actions of a response strategy in a data breach announcement, a company can mitigate these consequences. However, the literature reveals an inconsistent landscape regarding the effect of response actions on customers or investors. Using an event study, we show that the response actions impact a company's stock value and that this impact does not necessarily match the impact on the customer. We code the real-world response actions to data breaches, examining their impact on investor behavior using stock value. The results show that data breaches involving customer data have a negative impact on stock value. In addition, an apology for a data breach has been found to have harmful effects on investor behavior. Whereas justifying the data breach has no or a positive impact. These results add to the investor-focused literature on data breaches, showing that an impact on stock value can emerge from response actions. The literature on data breaches can be informed by the fact that not just is the customer perspective important, but also reactions from other affected groups should be included in formulating a response strategy. The paper also provides practical implications, showing how companies can improve their response strategies based on the results.}

Other traits such as formal seniority, age, tenure, and department membership were also found to increase InfoSec leadership.}

While this is easy to answer negatively in the most general case, it is interesting to note that the protection extends beyond non-recoverability towards plausible deniability: Given a ML model\nf\n, we show that one can take a set of purely random training data, and from this define a suitable “learning rule” that will produce a ML model that is exactly\nf\n. Thus, any speculation about which data has been used to train\nf\nis deniable upon the claim that any other data could have led to the same results. We corroborate our theoretical finding with practical examples and open source implementations of how to find the learning rules for a chosen set of training data.}

It addresses the risks associated with the integration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector.}

	abstract = {Recent security reports point to an alarming increase in the number and frequency of data breach attacks against organizations worldwide. With the rise of data breaches, how quickly a firm detects a breach determines the extent of the incident impact on the business and its customers.  Although prior studies have focused on several important factors that deal with the functions of detection, prevention and prediction of breach incidents, these studies have overlooked the time factor of breach detection. This research seeks to fulfill the lack of research and attempts to explore the factors that affect detection time of data breaches. Using survival analysis, we examine 696 publicly reported breaches between 2010 and 2017 and measure the impact of threat actors, attack types, affected confidentiality data, affected assets, and industries on breach detection time. Findings show that the time to detect data breaches caused by privilege misuse is 2.5 times slower, followed by 1.4 times for breaches that target servers. On the other hand, data breaches that involve payment card skimmers are 79% faster to detect.  To gain further insight into these factors that slow down detection time, we perform subgroup analyses. Findings show that data breaches involving privilege misuse through LAN access are 2.2 times slower to detect. Furthermore, data breaches targeting servers are 5.7 times slower to detect in the accommodation industry, followed by 2.8 times in the administrative industry, and 2.4 times in the healthcare industry.}

While studies have investigated the effects of individual factors such as privacy concern, and trust, on SNS users’ self-disclosure intention, less research has examined how characteristics of the SNS platform shape such intention. In this study, we focus on one critical characteristic of SNS platform, SNS transparency, and investigate its impact (direct and indirect via Information Control) on individuals’ self-disclosure intention and the moderating role of privacy disposition. Specifically, we identify three SNS transparency features—Network Transparency, Social Presence, and Monitoring. Drawing from Communication Privacy Management Theory and Social Penetration Theory, we empirically test how these SNS transparency features directly and indirectly via Information Control influence users’ self-disclosure intention. The results of our experiment show that network transparency has negative effects while social presence, as well as monitoring, have positive effects on information control. Network transparency, social presence, and information control have positive effects on self-disclosure intention. This study extends the literature by enhancing our understanding of how the SNS platform features and individual privacy disposition shape SNS users’ self-disclosure intention.}

	abstract = {Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is de-facto standard exploit mitigation in our daily life software. The simplest idea of unpredictably randomizing memory layout significantly raises the bar for memory exploitation due to the additionally required attack primitives such as information leakage. Ironically, although exceptional, there are rare edge cases where ASLR becomes handy for memory exploitation. In this paper, we dig into such theoretical set of cases and name it as BadASLR. Based on our study, we introduce four categories of BadASLR: (i) aiding free chunk reclamation in heap spraying attack, (ii) aiding stack pivoting in frame-pointer null poisoning attack, (iii) reviving the exploitability of invalid pointer referencing bug, and (iv) introducing wild-card ROP gadgets in x86/x64 position independent code environment. To evaluate if BadASLR can be an actual plausible scenario, we look into real-world bug bounty cases, CTF/wargame challenges. Surprisingly, we found multiple vulnerabilities in commercial software where ASLR becomes handy for attacker. With BadASLR cases, we succeeded in exploiting peculiar vulnerabilities, and received total 10,000 USD as bug bounty reward including one CVE assignment.}

	abstract = {The demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been exponentially increasing, and to achieve sustainable growth, the industry dictated rapid development of the supporting infrastructure. This requires building a reliable EV charging ecosystem that serves customer demands while ensuring the security of the Internet-enabled systems and the connected critical infrastructure against possible cyber attacks. To this end, we devise a system lookup and collection approach to obtain a representative sample of widely deployed EV Charging Station Management Systems (EVCSMS). Furthermore, we leverage reverse engineering and penetration testing techniques to perform a first-of-a-kind comprehensive security and vulnerability analysis of the identified EVCSMS and their software/firmware implementations. Indeed, our systematic analysis unveils an array of vulnerabilities, which demonstrate the insecurity of the EVCSMS against remote cyber attacks. Considering the feasibility of such attacks, we discuss attack implications against the EV charging stations (EVCS) and their users. More importantly, we simulate the impact of practical cyber attack scenarios against the power grid, which result in possible service disruption and failure in the grid. Finally, while we recommend mitigation measures, our discoveries raise concerns about the lack of adequate security considerations in the design of the deployed EVCS, which will motivate vendors to take immediate action to patch their developed systems. Indeed, our communication with the concerned parties resulted in positive responses from some vendors such as Schneider Electric, who acknowledged our findings by reserving 12 CVEs, respectively.}

In this paper, we propose a block-level monitoring system to detect potentially malicious cryptographic operations. We carry out statistical analysis to find heuristic rules to distinguish between normal and encrypted blocks. In order to apply the heuristic rule to the filesystem without kernel modification, we adopt Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) and define our filesystem Rcryptect for real-time detection of cryptographic function. We demonstrate the protection of well-known ransomware and show that various cryptographic functions can be detected with about 13% overhead.}

Although hundreds of features are available for machine learning-based malware detectors, adversaries can also utilize feature-related knowledge to develop variants of malware to evade detection. Therefore, a key role of the Android security community is to continuously propose new features that can characterize malicious behaviors.}

The key to defending against malware threats is how to extract the discriminative features of the apps and identify the samples. In order to alleviate the problem, a Siamese network is proposed to achieve high-performance Android malware detection. Meanwhile, a feature grouping (FG) strategy is also designed to choose valuable Permission and API calls effectively. In order to further improve the detection speed, a Feature Centralized Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (FCSCNN) is proposed, the benign and malicious mean centers are calculated from the sample database at first. Then, the distances between the application and the two centers are calculated to determine the class. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method FCSCNN can achieve the accuracy of 98.07% on the public dataset “VirusShare”, and the detection time is less than 0.1 s.}

Malware is the general nomenclature for malicious software. Malware classification is an undecidable problem and technically NP hard problem because the halting problem is NP hard. In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network based novel method for malware classification. Since CNN models use the images as input, bytes files are transformed to gray separately and RGB image formats for the classification process. A new approach called B2IMG is developed for the transformation of bytes file. Moreover, a new CycleGAN-based data augmentation method is proposed to address the problem of imbalanced data size between malware families. The proposed system was tested on the BIG2015, and DumpWare10 datasets. According to the experimental results, classification performance increased thanks to the proposed data augmentation method. The accuracy of the classification is 99.86% for the BIG2015 dataset and 99.60% for the dataset.}

Therefore, in this paper we review the existing literature to understand the diverse attack vectors associated with communication, navigation, and surveillance systems, and how some of these security issues can be mitigated. Although a number of survey and review articles have analyzed various wireless technologies in aviation, to the best of our knowledge, no work has systematically analyzed them from communication, navigation and surveillance perspectives collectively.

	abstract = {In the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), once malicious users have gained access to the sharing data, they are able to obtain real private data, leading to serious privacy leakage issues. Thus, if the data user does not access the original private data, but instead accesses the perturbed data, while guaranteeing certain statistical characteristics, this would greatly improve the privacy of the CP-ABE technology as well as enhance its security. Motivated by this, an integration of basic CP-ABE and local differential privacy (LDP) based on randomized response for achieving multi-level privacy-preserving data sharing (MPDS), which has a relatively lower complexity and higher data utility, is constructed to provide double privacy protection for data owners at the source. To prevent different trusted data users from colluding and gaining more privacy beyond their trust levels, a random perturbation strategy is elaborately designed for resisting collusion attacks (RCA) while guaranteeing that the output of RCA perturbation strategy is the same as that of the original perturbation, which has been proved from the theoretical level. Finally, the proposed MPDS-RCA scheme is simulated and verified on both synthetic and real data sets, which indicates that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing MPPDS scheme in terms of the average error rate, the KL-divergence and the JS-divergence while reducing the computational cost by approximately 50%.}

Although this centralized architecture provides various advantages in terms of effortlessly managing and optimizing network resources, this makes SDN vulnerable to conventional distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by making the network inoperable due to the overloaded network traffic. To address the vulnerability, in this work, we propose a detection and countermeasure scheme based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The scheme uses features obtained from CWT as the input for the CNN classifier to differentiate attack samples from the normal ones. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high detection rate against DNS amplification, NTP and TCP-SYN flood attacks with a remarkably low false alarm rate.}

We hypothesize that users are giving up on security compliance because they believe breaches are inevitable. We test the explanatory theory of security capitulation based on technology threat avoidance, protection motivation theory, and technology acceptance theory. Capitulation theory examines distrust of security, theft of privacy, vulnerability, security threats and security self-efficacy as predictors of capitulation, which influences motivation to protect computing assets. Results indicate that distrust of security, loss of privacy, vulnerability, threats, and self-efficacy are significantly related to capitulation.

	abstract = {Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS) designate the mechanisms that are used to automate buildings’ operations such as climate control, lightning and access control. As such, traditional BACS encompass extensively automated buildings managed in an integrated manner, with the support of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and specialized industry standards such as BACnet and KNX. More recently, the increasing adoption of IP-connected, IoT-like devices for automating single tasks led to a substantial increase in the number of automated building functions (especially for the smart home domain), although rarely with extensive or integrated automation levels. The interconnection with the building local area network (LAN) and even the Internet, comes with the cost of a wider exposition to attacks, that can either begin inside of the building or be initiated from anywhere outside of it.}

	abstract = {The traditional power network has now evolved into the smart grid, where cyber technology enables automated control, greater efficiency, and improved stability. However, this integration of information technology exposes critical infrastructure to potential cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the interdependent nature of the grid’s composite information and operational technology networks means that vulnerability extends across interconnected devices and systems. Therefore, a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, which is relatively easy to deploy but potentially highly disruptive, can be used strategically against the smart grid with particularly egregious results. In this paper, we take inspiration from epidemiological modelling to propose a compromise propagation model, alongside a behavioural DDoS model, to explore how dependencies between the grid’s networks might influence the scale and impact of DDoS attacks. We found that the internal connectedness of a network amplifies the received impact of failures in an external network on which it is dependent. Furthermore, testing showed that alongside attack force, attack duration influences recovery times, due to both the quantity of resources consumed and the time needed to accumulate recoveries. The models were validated against simulations conducted with cyber-security providers L7 Defense, showing our approach to be a viable companion or alternative to traditional graph-based dependency models.}

	abstract = {We present an economic model for decisions on competing cyber-security and cyber-insurance investment based on the Gordon-Loeb model for investment in information security. We consider a one-period scenario in which a firm may invest in information security measures to reduce the probability of a breach, in cyber-insurance or in a combination of both. The optimal combination of investment and insurance under the assumptions of the Gordon-Loeb model is investigated via consideration of the costs and benefits of investment in security alongside purchasing insurance at an independent premium rate. Under both exponential (constant absolute risk aversion) and logarithmic (constant relative risk aversion) utility functions it is found that when the insurance premium is below a certain value, utility is maximised with insurance and security investment. These results suggest that cyber-insurance is a worthwhile undertaking provided it is not overly costly. We believe this model to be the first attempt to integrate the Gordon-Loeb model into a classical microeconomic analysis of insurance, particularly using the Gordon-Loeb security breach functions to determine the probability of an insurance claim. The model follows the tradition of the Gordon-Loeb model in being accessible to practitioners and decision makers in information security.}

	abstract = {Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are extensively used in medical application scenarios to record, stimulate, or inhibit neural activity with different purposes. An example is the stimulation of some brain areas to reduce the effects generated by Parkinson’s disease. Despite the advances in recent years, cybersecurity on BCIs is an open challenge since attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities of invasive BCIs to induce malicious stimulation or treatment disruption, affecting neuronal activity. In this work, we design and implement a novel neuronal cyberattack called Neuronal Jamming (JAM), which prevents neurons from producing spikes. To implement and measure the JAM impact, and due to the lack of realistic neuronal topologies in mammalians, we have defined a use case using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to allow a simulated mouse to exit a particular maze. The resulting model has been translated to a biological neural topology, simulating a portion of a mouse’s visual cortex. The impact of JAM on both biological and artificial networks is measured, analyzing how the attacks can both disrupt the spontaneous neural signaling and the mouse’s capacity to exit the maze. Besides, another contribution of the work focuses on comparing the impacts of both JAM and FLO (an existing neural cyberattack), demonstrating that JAM generates a higher impact in terms of neuronal spike rate. As a final contribution, we discuss whether and how JAM and FLO attacks could induce the effects of neurodegenerative diseases if the implanted BCI had a comprehensive electrode coverage of the targeted brain regions.}

	abstract = {Digital technologies are increasingly being adopted in modern supply chains for product traceability, enabling data sharing amongst trading partners, quick availability of product data, and end-to-end visibility of products. This adoption increases the system attack-surface and the number of cyber threats capable of harmful business impact, such as leak of business data, disruption of business operations, and loss of reputation, intellectual property and financial assets. A supply chain network thus needs an effective cyber security and threat management strategy, which requires reaching a thorough understanding of the most important assets and resources in a supply chain traceability system, the cyber threats that may impact them, and potential countermeasures.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection system is an important cyber defence tool to protect a system from illegal attacks. Building an effective network intrusion detection system that makes good use of deep learning methods is a challenging task. From the object perspective, different types of malicious attacks have a quite imbalance distribution, especially compared with normal network behaviour. From the feature perspective, the network behaviour description contains heterogeneous features, including numeric and categorical features and complex interactions among these features. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel Network Intrusion Detection System which by learning explicit and implicit feature interactions based on representation learning, i.e., RL-NIDS, which models the network behaviour by learning explicit and implicit feature interactions in both feature value representation and object representation spaces. Specifically, the RL-NIDS consists of two main modules, i.e., unsupervised Feature Value Representation Learning module (FVRL) which aims to learn the feature interactions among categorical features explicitly, and supervised Neural Network for object Representation Learning (NNRL) which aims to learn the implicit interactions in the representation space. Experiments show the effectiveness of RL-NIDS and the object representation learned by RL-NIDS with multiclass classification on two real-world datasets. The RL-NIDS outperforms the state-of-the-art feature selection-based methods and deep learning-based methods in terms of both overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The accuracy of classification of NSL-KDD and AWIDS dataset is 81.38% and 95.72%, respectively, achieve 3.9% and 0.9% improvements compare to the second-best method. Moreover, a thorough ablation study demonstrates the contributions of both FVRL and NNRL which complement each other for capturing feature interactions.}
