	abstract = {Deep learning models used to process 3D point cloud data exhibit a vulnerability to adversarial examples, which can result in potential misclassification. The research community has pivoted towards applying traditional optimization methods to generate adversarial examples specifically for the point cloud domain. However, these traditional optimization-based adversarial approaches come with their own set of limitations, including inconsistent point importance, non-optimal multi-label optimization, inflexible adversarial and perceptibility losses, and difficulty in constructing perceivable adversarial examples in physical environments. To surmount these challenges, we have introduced two novel techniques: a Local Aggressive Adversarial Attack (L3A) for simulated environments and a Normal Vector Metric Attack (NVMA) for physical environments. The L3A operates by enhancing the cost-effectiveness ratio between the attack and perceptibility aspects. This enhancement is realized through a combination of strategies, including local salient points, modeling example preference, and adjusting the goals for attack potency and indistinguishability. The NVMA generates physically printable adversarial point clouds by maintaining consistency in high-frequency regions between clean and adversarial examples. Our methods exhibit superior performance when tested against state-of-the-art point cloud deep learning models on benchmark datasets and physical models. This contribution enhances our understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses within the realm of 3D point cloud data. Our code is available at https://github.com/Chenfeng1271/L3A.}

	abstract = {Deep generative models are promising in detecting novel cyber-physical attacks, mitigating the vulnerability of Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) without relying on labeled information. Nonetheless, these generative models face challenges in identifying attack behaviors that closely resemble normal data, or deviate from the normal data distribution but are in close proximity to the manifold of the normal cluster in latent space. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel unsupervised dual variational generative adversarial model named MST-DVGAN, to perform anomaly detection in multivariate time series data for CPS security. The central concept is to enhance the model's discriminative capability by widening the distinction between reconstructed abnormal samples and their normal counterparts. Specifically, we propose an augmented module by imposing contrastive constraints on the reconstruction process to obtain a more compact embedding. Then, by exploiting the distribution property and modeling the normal patterns of multivariate time series, a variational autoencoder is introduced to force the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate diverse samples. Furthermore, two augmented loss functions are designed to extract essential characteristics in a self-supervised manner through mutual guidance between the augmented samples and original samples. Finally, a specific feature center loss is introduced for the generator network to enhance its stability. Empirical experiments are conducted on three public datasets, namely SWAT, WADI and NSL_KDD. Comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, the evaluation results show that the proposed MTS-DVGAN is more stable and can achieve consistent performance improvement.}

The classical firewalls failed to meet various requirements of the current security of the networks due to the increasing number of network attacks. Hence, an optimization-enabled deep learning model Rat Swarm Hunter Prey Optimization-Deep Maxout Network (RSHPO-DMN) technique is designed to effectively handle various network threats. The Z-score data normalization is applied for data pre-processing initially and by considering chord distance, the data is transformed into usable formats. The transformed data are extracted using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature and the extracted feature is converted into vector format for network intrusion detection process. The DMN is used for intrusion detection in networks and the designed RSHPO model is used to boost the intrusion detection rate exhibited in the classifier. The RSHPO-DMN model achieved superior performance under different evaluation indicators with accuracy of 90.88 %, precision of 93.58 %, recall of 96.54 %, and f1-score of 95.04 % respectively than other prevailing intrusion detection approaches.}

	abstract = {Despite the enhanced security benefits offered by Physical Authentication Devices (PADs) compared to other forms of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), the adoption and retention of PADs remain relatively low in comparison to other MFA methods. Evidence indicates that the limited widespread adoption and usage of PADs are primarily due to negative user perceptions concerning their usability and security features. Moreover, there's a limited understanding of how users from diverse backgrounds perceive PADs with their varying standards and features. To bridge this knowledge gap, we undertook a multiple case study with 23 users spanning varied demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, and experience with MFA) to use and test three distinct PADs. Case study participants were provided with three unique PAD devices featuring different characteristics/features and were prompted to share their experiences of installation, usage, and troubleshooting over a 2-week span via an initial questionnaire, logbook, and a final interview. The gathered data were analysed using NVIVO, a Qualitative Research Software platform, uncovering notable disparities between user groups and their predilections for specific PADs. Further discussions from our research illuminate four primary areas (Compatibility, Support, Quality and Simplicity) where usable security features impede positive user perception of PAD devices and addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing PAD adoption and retention rates.}

There has been little focus in previous studies on how users choose from a list of login options and how to better inform users about privacy issues in web SSO systems. In this paper, we conducted a 200-participant study to understand factors that influence participants' login decisions, and how they are affected by displaying permission differences across login options; permissions in SSO result in release of user personal information to third-party web sites through SSO identity providers. We compare and report on login decisions made by participants before and after viewing permission-related information, examine self-reported responses for reasons related to their login decisions, and report on the factors that motivated their choices. We find that usability preferences and inertia (habituation) were among the dominant factors influencing login decisions. After participants viewed permission-related information, many prioritised privacy over other factors, changing their login decisions to more privacy-friendly alternatives. Displaying permission-related information also influenced some participants to make tradeoffs between privacy and usability preferences.}

	abstract = {Software development projects are built on top of external libraries and tools that help manage code and databases and/or facilitate deployment. The external libraries that assist in these tasks create dependent relations with the developed software, thereby increasing the use of dependencies as a common practice. There exist mechanisms in the projects to set up software dependencies in terms of versions and restrictions between said projects. However, any problem, error, or vulnerability affecting a software's configuration dependencies can render the whole project vulnerable. This turns a secure dependency into an insecure dependency, and hinders the maintenance of security in software development projects, since current tools do not cover all possible configurations of dependencies. In this paper, our approach that enables the analysis and inference of the configuration of dependencies of projects in terms of potentially vulnerable configurations. The proposal is developed by constructing a dependency graph network attributed to vulnerabilities. Formal models are integrated based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to enable automatic analysis, such as the identification of the most secure configuration of dependencies. The automatic analysis facilitates ascertaining the vulnerability-free configurations of dependencies with maximum and minimum vulnerability impacts. This proposal has been evaluated by analysing more than 140 Python open-source code repositories and better results than other proposals have been achieved.}

	abstract = {Phishing emails are constantly increasing their sophistication, and typical countermeasures struggle at addressing them. Attackers target our cognitive vulnerabilities with a varied set of techniques, and each of us, not trained enough or simply in the wrong moment, can be deceived and put an entire organization in trouble. To date, no study has evaluated the behavior of users when confronted with phishing emails characterized by a diverse set of features and attack strategies. We created a system called Spamley from these observations, which has the main aim of collecting and sharing data regarding such user behavior. Spamley is also meant to disseminate awareness among users. To reach these goals, we firstly analyzed the wide scientific literature on phishing. Our analysis shows that the focus of studies on phishing has more and more shifted from technical to human-oriented aspects. Building on this analysis we designed, implemented, and deployed a system comprising a web application to test user awareness about phishing, featuring a survey to identify the most interesting characteristics of users, and fueled by a large and varied set of test emails engineered to solicit the several possible cognitive vulnerabilities we all have. We describe in details the design and implementation choices, the lessons we learned, and the way we filled the gap in the available related work. Finally, we use real data from our first 500 users to show how data collected can be used for several important analyses, including which characteristics of the emails are more relevant for which cognitive vulnerability of specific groups of users. Results obtained can guide the development of novel email clients as well as tailored training programmes. Data collected is available to the scientific community for conducting further studies on the important and still unsolved issue of email phishing.}

While robust data protection techniques are generally considered beneficial, they may interfere with evidence collection during digital forensics investigations. As this is a known fact, secure instant messengers are often used by criminals to conduct clandestine communications. Therefore, identifying potential ways to collect data from secure instant messengers is crucial for digital forensic investigations. We analyzed Wickr, a secure instant messenger, to determine possible data collection methods. We considered various cases that might be encountered during digital forensics investigations and listed the main data that can be collected for each case, much of which was encrypted, or the data for encrypting the data. We analyzed the collected data and the log-in process of Wickr in detail, through which we succeeded in logging in without knowing the password of the account used on the target computer, because the password was verified on the client, not the server, after the first login. Based on our analysis results, we showed that it is possible to log in to Wickr without password even from devices that have never been logged in, when certain conditions are met. It was performed through reverse engineering. Our results indicate that there may be various data collection methods for secure instant messengers from a digital forensics investigation perspective, and that more study is needed.}

	abstract = {Web privacy-enhancing technologies have been grown to preserve the users' privacy against sophisticated traffic analysis attacks aimed at inferring sensitive information. An especially concerning form of traffic analysis attacks is website fingerprinting attacks, allowing local eavesdroppers to identify a user's visited websites over encrypted connections. Leveraging recent advances in AI methods and aligned with the principle of adversarial thinking (think like an adversary), our objective is to better understand privacy vulnerabilities of HTTPS traffic against ever-evolving traffic analysis attacks. Therefore, as a novel contribution, we propose an HTTPS website fingerprinting attack model called Super-Learner Attack, an ensemble of base learners to exploit the strengths and diminish the weaknesses of the individual base learners, including LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNeighborsClassifier, AdaboostClassifier, BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and ExtraTreeClassifier. The SuperLearner aims to learn fusion weights in a data-adaptive manner to obtain the optimal combination of the base learners. The proposed attack attains a high accuracy of over 97% on HTTPS traffic, outperforming existing attack models. Furthermore, responding to the challenge of website fingerprinting attacks and in direct response to the SuperLearner Attacker, we propose HTTPS Obfuscation Defender. This is a novel and highly effective defense strategy rooted in deception. This strategy disrupts classification by skillfully introducing fake packets into real flows, obfuscating patterns, and disrupting classification. Unlike previous methods, our approach leverages adversarial example algorithms originally designed for image analysis, to generate maximal obfuscation in encrypted HTTPS traffic. It generates perturbations for encrypted HTTPS traffic through the utilization of three well-established adversarial example algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that HTTPS Obfuscation Defender significantly reduces the accuracy of website fingerprinting from 97.2% to 2.89%, even when an attacker attempts to adapt to the defense and retrain a classifier using defended traffic. Moreover, our proposed defense ensures a minimal impact on time and bandwidth, making it a highly practical and resource-efficient defense approach.}

	abstract = {Many works have shown that the adversarial examples being generated on a known substitute model have the ability to mislead other unknown black-box models, which has attracted widespread attention. Recently, many model augmentation methods have been presented to boost the corresponding transferability of adversarial examples by transforming the images to simulate diverse models for attack. However, existing model augmentation methods focus on the transformations in a single domain and may restrict the diversity of simulated models. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel model augmentation method named Hybrid Augmentation Method (HAM). Our approach comprises two components, channel-wise scaling (CS) and spectrum masking (SM). Specifically, we first transform the images with CS in the spatial domain, which enhances the diversity of transformed images by randomly scaling the channel. Then we apply SM to randomly remove some frequency information of the images in the frequency domain, further increasing the diversity of the transformed images. Instead of confining the transformations in a single domain, we take transformations both in the spatial and frequency domain simultaneously. This enables us to get more various transformed images and largely increases the diversity of simulated models to create more powerful adversarial examples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method on both undefended and defense models, which largely outperforms the considered attacks. Moreover, our method can be integrated with other attacks to further enhance the adversarial transferability.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of Internet technology, industrial control systems (ICS) have started to access the Internet, which significantly facilitates engineers to manage ICS remotely but also exposes risks. Usually, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to secure network systems. Feature selection plays a crucial role in IDSs because detecting anomalies from high-dimensional network traffic features is time-consuming. However, few specific studies have been conducted for ICS. Many redundant features and data imbalance problems in ICS data lead to poor performance and low efficiency of generic IDS classification. In this paper, we design a genetic algorithm-based feature selection method for ICS characteristics. The proposed method incorporates a feature ranking fusion mechanism in the genetic algorithm for eliminating redundant features, enhances the global merit-seeking speed using the growing tree clustering idea, and we also design a new fitness function for ICS characteristics. The effectiveness and advancement of the proposed method are demonstrated on a real ICS dataset.}

	abstract = {Over the last decade, researchers have extensively explored the vulnerabilities of Android malware detectors to adversarial examples through the development of evasion attacks; however, the practicality of these attacks in real-world scenarios remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in reality, malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper introduces EvadeDroid, a problem-space adversarial attack designed to effectively evade black-box Android malware detectors in real-world scenarios. EvadeDroid constructs a collection of problem-space transformations derived from benign donors that share opcode-level similarity with malware apps by leveraging an n-gram-based approach. These transformations are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a query-efficient optimization algorithm that can find and inject optimal sequences of transformations into malware apps. Our empirical evaluations, carried out on 1K malware apps, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating real-world adversarial examples in both soft- and hard-label settings. Our findings reveal that EvadeDroid can effectively deceive diverse malware detectors that utilize different features with various feature types. Specifically, EvadeDroid achieves evasion rates of 80%–95% against DREBIN, Sec-SVM, ADE-MA, MaMaDroid, and Opcode-SVM with only 1–9 queries. Furthermore, we show that the proposed problem-space adversarial attack is able to preserve its stealthiness against five popular commercial antiviruses with an average of 79% evasion rate, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.}

This has led to the development of hardware systems that implement security services. Therefore, from a taxonomy to sort and classify the key criteria to processor design, an overview and in-depth analysis of soft-processors that implement algorithms for Internet of Thing applications is presented highlighting their advantages and disadvantages to be used in larger systems. In order to perform a systematic review of the engineering literature related to the interest topic in this work, a bidirectional review methodology consisting of the following three phases has been proposed and applied: review planning, review conducting, and review reporting. Then, soft-processor architectures implementing security algorithms are compared considering computational cost, speed, bus size, number of pipeline stages, and performance. Finally, based on a feature analysis, the strengths and threats of soft-processors when implementing information security for Internet of Things applications are discussed, and the LORS design model is proposed to lead to recommendations for future designs.}

In image classification tasks, XAI tools highlight pixels influencing the decision given by a model. This helps in troubleshooting the model and determining areas that may require further tuning of parameters. With a wide range of tools available in the market, choosing the right tool for a model becomes necessary as each one may highlight different sets of pixels for a given image. There is a need to evaluate different tools and decide the best performing ones among them. Generic XAI evaluation methods like insertion or removal of salient pixels/segments are applicable for general image classification tasks but may produce less meaningful results when applied on deepfake detection models due to their functionality. In this paper, we perform experiments to show that generic removal/insertion XAI evaluation methods are not suitable for deepfake detection models. We also propose and implement an XAI evaluation approach specifically suited for deepfake detection models.}

However, the intricate nature of IoT connections and device vulnerabilities exposes the devices to security threats. To address the security challenges, we propose a proactive defense framework that leverages a model-based approach for security analysis and facilitates the defense strategies. Our proposed approach incorporates proactive defense mechanisms that combine Moving Target Defense techniques with cyber deception. The proposed approach involves the use of a decoy nodes as a deception technique and operating system based diversity as a moving target defense strategy to change the attack surface area of IoT networks. Additionally, we introduce a technique known as Important Measure-based Operating System Diversity to reduce defense cost. The effectiveness of the defense mechanisms was evaluated by using a graphical security model in a Software Defined Networking-based IoT network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating the impact of attacks while maintaining high performance levels in IoT networks.}

	abstract = {In the field of smart healthcare, sharing of electronic data records (EHRs) has become popularity. As cloud computing develops, storing data in the cloud and setting access policies has become a common approach for EHRs data sharing. However, considering the collaborative nature of the diagnosis in healthcare, it is crucial to enhance flexible access control of shared EHRs data using delegation authorization. At the same time, the process of authorization must be achieved under controlled as well as traceable conditions. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is one solution to address fine-grained access control, but the lack of management of the delegation process in existing solutions makes it difficult to apply ABAC directly in combination with delegation authorization. In this paper, we propose a threshold traceable delegation authorization (TTDA) scheme for EHRs data sharing. By using TTDA scheme, data owner who with limited resources can delegate multiple authorized users to complete authorization operation with a threshold-based manner. In TTDA scheme, we use accountability threshold signatures to help data owner traces the users who execute the authorization. We prove the security of TTDA scheme under the IND-CPA security model. Finally, we conduct sufficient realistic experiments, and the experimental outcomes prove the practicability of TTDA scheme.}

	abstract = {Nowadays domestic smart security devices, such as smart locks, smart doorbells, and security cameras, are becoming increasingly popular with users, due to their ease of use, convenience, and declining prices. Unlike conventional non-smart security devices, such as alarms and locks, performance standards for smart security devices, such as the British TS 621, are not easily understandable by end users due to the technical language employed. Users also have very few sources of unbiased information regarding product performance in real world conditions and protection against attacks from cyber attacker-burglars and, as a result, tend to take manufacturer claims at face value. This means that, as this work proves, users may be exposed to threats, such as theft, impersonation (should an attacker steal their credentials), and even physical injury, if the device fails and is used to prevent access to hazardous environments. As such, this paper deploys several attacks using popular wireless attack vectors (i.e., 433 MHz radio, Bluetooth, and RFID) against domestic smart security devices to assess the protection offered against a cyber attacker-burglar. Our results suggest that users are open to considerable cyber physical attacks, irrespective if they use lesser known (i.e., no name) or branded smart security devices, due to the poor security offered by these devices.}

The sudden shift from offline to online activities and work may have resulted in new cybersecurity risks. The present study therefore examined changes in the prevalence, nature and impact of cybercrime among Dutch citizens and SME owners, during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews with ten experts working at various public and private organizations in the Netherlands that have insights into cybercrime victimization and data from victim surveys administrated in 2019 and 2021 were analyzed. The results show that there was only a small, non-statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cybercrime during the pandemic among citizens and SME owners. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic did have an impact on the modus operandi of cybercriminals: victims indicated that a considerable proportion of the offenses was related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the case of online fraud. Moreover, the use of new applications and programs for work was associated with an increased risk of cybercrime victimization during the COVID-19 crisis. These results suggest that increases in rates of registered cybercrime that were found in previous studies might be the consequence of a reporting effect and that cybercriminals adapt their modus operandi to current societal developments.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) utilisation has achieved a vast global impact. This is evident in the cybersecurity sector, where ML has wide-ranging applications, such as identifying and blocking threats, uncovering unusual software and user behaviour, and many others. However, the increase in successful cyberattacks demonstrates that the effectiveness of ML in cybersecurity applications can be questioned. Although the attacks may be new, ML is often adopted due to its ability to handle diverse and often unforeseen situations – a capability that is not possible using traditional rule-based security mechanisms. As both the rate of attacks and adoption of ML solutions are increasing, there is a need to determine whether ML-based security solutions are meeting the expectations of businesses and whether businesses are genuinely aware of the ML capabilities and limitations. Moreover, current literature shows a significant variation in how ML solutions are evaluated in cybersecurity applications, which might result in a poor understanding of ML capabilities. This paper explores the common perceptions and observations of decision-makers and specialists using ML for cybersecurity regarding its capabilities, implementation, evaluation, and communication. A semi-structured interview is conducted with individuals in various managerial positions to perform this investigation. The finding of this study reveals a pressing need for a standard to manifest ML capabilities. As significant variation in the understanding of Machine Learning Cyber Security (MLCS) capabilities is observed, a standard could help better communicate MLCS capabilities. It is observed that external influences heavily impact ML adoption decisions, potentially leading to misinterpretation of ML capabilities.}

	abstract = {The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing is a form of attack typically used by attackers to cause a denial of service or man-in-the-middle attacks. This attack comes from ARP weaknesses and aims to compromise victims' ARP caches by sending ARP packets containing fake IP-MAC pairs. To overcome ARP spoofing attacks, several approaches leverage the advantages of software-defined networking (SDN) to detect malicious users in the network. To achieve their goal, the SDN controller consecutively checks the characteristics of each ARP packet to ensure its correctness. However, this verification method can lead to latency and congestion at the controller level or render the system unusable for large-scale networks. To address this drawback, we propose a game-theoretic approach to provide an optimal verification method that considers the intelligent attackers' decision-making process during an ARP cache poisoning attempt. This approach is a zero-sum game between the attacker who wants to poison the victims' ARP caches and the defender who must avoid this poisoning. The game model results in mixed-strategy Nash equilibria that identify optimal verification methods to prevent control plane latency and congestion during attacker detection. The results show that an intelligent attacker will refrain from poisoning ARP caches with a high-impact strategy because the defender frequently checks such a strategy. In addition, the attacker's penalty value can deter both rational and irrational attackers from poisoning ARP caches. Simulations in the Mininet simulator have shown that the proposed approach can significantly mitigate control plane latency and congestion during the attacker's characteristic checking.}

	abstract = {The differential privacy k-means (DP k-means) clustering algorithm emerged to address the privacy protection challenges in the field of data mining. However, the algorithm encounters difficulties in achieving clustering usability and convergence. Privacy budget (ε), a critical parameter determining the noise addition in differential privacy algorithms, garners significant attention. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus to studying privacy budget allocation strategies within the DP k-means clustering algorithm. However, the selection of a privacy budget allocation strategy in the DP k-means algorithm is an NP-hard problem. Our initial intuition is that genetic algorithms can efficiently discover relatively optimal privacy budget sequences. In this context, we propose a genetic algorithm-based privacy budget allocation strategy (GAPBAS) to ensure the convergence and usability of the DP k-means algorithm. Firstly, convergence is ensured by selecting improved initial centroids and rigorously controlling the minimum privacy budget for the DP k-means algorithm. Additionally, the privacy budget allocation strategy of the DP k-means algorithm is reformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. This entails merging privacy budgets from multiple iterative rounds into a sequential sequence and utilizing a genetic algorithm to select the optimal privacy budget allocation strategy, thereby significantly enhancing the usability of the DP k-means algorithm. Comparative experiments against the other four privacy budget allocation strategies in the DP k-means algorithm demonstrate the superior performance of the genetic algorithm-based privacy budget allocation strategy at the same level of privacy protection.}

	abstract = {With continuous authentication, smartphones can constantly calculate authentication scores to verify a user's identity while interacting with the smartphones after logging in. Among various behavioral biometrics based continuous authentication methods, motion dynamics biometrics based methods draw a lot of attention, which relies on potential differences in signals from smartphone built-in motion sensors to provide an implicit and secure authentication. However, existing motion dynamics based methods not only fail to model correlations between motion sensors with multiple channels but also ignore temporal patterns contained in each channel. In this paper, we develop a two-tower neural networks based continuous authentication system TNNAuth based on the built-in multi-motion sensors on smartphones. Specifically, TNNAuth divides the raw multi-motion sensor data into channel and temporal stream data, and proposes a gated two-tower transformer fusion network to capture both time-over-channel and channel-over-time motion patterns. To evaluate TNNAuth, we collect a large-scale multi-motion sensor dataset in the unconstrained real life. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNNAuth can provide the lowest authentication error rate, with a false-acceptance rate of 8.3% and a false-rejection rate of 9.4%.}

	abstract = {Learning from cyber incidents is crucial for organisations to enhance their cyber resilience and effectively respond to evolving threats. This study employs neo-institutional and organisational learning theories to examine how organisations learn from incidents and gain insights into the challenges they face. Drawing on qualitative research methods, interviews were conducted with 34 security practitioners from organisations operating in the UK spanning a range of industries. The findings highlight the importance of consciously evaluating learning practices and creating a culture of openness to hear about incidents from employees, customers and suppliers. Deciding which incidents to learn from, as well as who should participate in the learning process, emerged as critical considerations. Overcoming defensiveness and addressing systemic causes were recognised as barriers to effective learning. The study emphasises the need to assess the value and impact of identified lessons and to avoid superficial reviews that treat symptoms rather than underlying causes to improve resilience. While progress has been made in learning from incidents, further enhancements are needed. Practical recommendations have been proposed to suggest how organisations may gain valuable insights for maximising the benefits derived from incident learning. This research contributes to the existing knowledge on organisational learning and informs future studies exploring the social and political influences on the learning process. By considering the suggested recommendations, organisations may strengthen their cyber security, foster a culture of continuous improvement, and respond effectively to the dynamic cyber security landscape.}

To eliminate the data leakage of federated learning, in this paper, we propose a secure multiparty federated learning control system, including a secure training process and a secure prediction process. In the training process, data providers train the learning model collaboratively without disclosing local data. The trained model can be verified by participants. The data providers can then provide users with prediction services based on the trained model. In the prediction process, data providers cannot access the user data, and users cannot obtain the model. Also, the prediction result can be verified by users. We carry out comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Network flow watermarking (NFW) has been widely used in flow trace back. However, most of the existing NFW methods cannot work efficiently due to the weakness of resisting channel interferences, establishing reliable synchronization, and resisting statistical analysis-based NFW attacks. To this end, a hybrid packet sequence-timing-based flow watermarking (HSTW) method is proposed, for which packet sequence and packet timing constitute a hybrid carrier to carry watermark information. HSTW modulates the packet sequence of the flow and represents the watermark information by the relative time relationship between the packet reordering, which improves the robustness of the watermark against delay jitter and packet loss. By designing a synchronization header based on the specific packet sequence, the information synchronization is achieved at any position of the flow. To resist statistical analysis-based NFW attacks, the packet sequence modulation is carried out in the form of slight packet reordering. The random distribution of the watermark is achieved based on the synchronization header, eliminating the time correlation between multiple watermarked flows. By a large number of experiments based on real-time traffic and public datasets, the results show that in comparison with the existing methods, HSTW has stronger robustness and more reliable synchronization. Compared with timing-based and rate-based methods, the accuracy of HSTW under delay jitter is increased by 32.17% to 34.50%. The accuracy of HSTW under packet loss interference is improved by 20.11% to 26.89% in comparison with sequence-based methods. HSTW can achieve information synchronization even if only partial watermarked flow can be obtained. Furthermore, HSTW can avoid the detection of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and multi-flow attacks.}

	abstract = {Recently, the frequency and complexity of ransomware attacks have been increasing steadily, posing significant threats to individuals and organizations alike. While traditional signature-based antiransomware systems are effective in the detection of known threats, they struggle to identify new ransomware samples. To address this limitation, many researchers have focused on analyzing the behavior and actions of executables. During this dynamic analysis process, various dynamic-based features emerge, offering different perspectives on the executable's behavior, including Application Program Interface (API) call sequences, dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and mutual exclusions. Existing methods mostly perform machine or deep learning models for feature engineering and detection. These methods usually perform learning according to a single perspective or by combining data from different perspectives into the frequency domain. In this case, they may ignore the information from the other aspects or the sequence relationship between the features. In addition, learning models used in these solutions are mostly incomprehensible to humans, which could be an obstacle in terms of having an insight through the model's mentality and also ransomware's way of work. In this study, we provide XRan (eXplainable deep learning-based RANsomware detection using dynamic analysis), an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) supported ransomware detection system that combines different dynamic analysis-based sequences, each representing a different view of the executable, in order to enrich the feature space. XRan employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to detect ransomware and two XAI models as Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide local and global explanations for detection. Experimental results demonstrate that XRan provides up to 99.4% True Positive Rate (TPR), and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Code obfuscation is a promising technique for securing software and protecting it from adversaries. The objective is to harden the exploitation of security vulnerabilities for the attacker as well as launching of successful attacks. Obfuscation can be classified into layout, data, and control flow obfuscation. Control flow obfuscation impedes the understanding of the application logic by making it complicated to determine the actual control flows. Although numerous control flow methods exist in the literature, the role of existing compiler optimizations has just been discovered. This paper is the first one that explores the existing optimization space of LLVM compiler for obfuscating code. Our techniques optimally explore the native compiler's optimizations to improve the original code performance and reduce memory space with no disruptive efforts, tools, or extra costs. In the CBench benchmark suite, our work is able to improve 246%, 143%, and 468% in cyclomatic complexity, program length, and implementation effort, respectively, compared to unobfuscated code. Therefore, instead of inventing new obfuscation tools, the existing compiler optimizations can easily be used to obfuscate control flows, saving the overall cost and efforts.}

	abstract = {Concept drift poses a critical challenge in deploying machine learning models to mitigate practical malware threats. It refers to the phenomenon that the distribution of test data changes over time, gradually deviating from the original training data and degrading model performance. A promising direction for addressing concept drift is to detect drift samples and then retrain the model. However, this field currently lacks a unified, well-curated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive outcomes. To improve the evaluation and advance further, this paper presents a new Benchmark dataset for trustworthy Malware Family Classification (BenchMFC), which includes 223 K samples of 526 families that evolve over years. BenchMFC provides clear family, packer, and timestamp tags for each sample, it thus can support research on three types of malware concept drift: 1) unseen families, 2) packed families, and 3) evolved families. To collect unpacked family samples from large-scale candidates, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing malware annotation pipeline, which unifies packing detection and family annotation as a consensus inference problem to prevent costly packing detection. Moreover, we provide two case studies to illustrate the application of BenchMFC in 1) concept drift detection and 2) model retraining. The first case demonstrates the impact of three types of malware concept drift and compares nine notable concept drift detectors. The results show that existing detectors have their own advantages in dealing with different types of malware concept drift, and there is still room for improvement in malware concept drift detection. The second case explores how static feature-based machine learning operates on packed samples when retraining a model. The experiments illustrate that packers do preserve some kind of signals that appear to be “effective” for machine learning models, but the robustness of these signals requires further research. BenchMFC has been released to the community at https://github.com/crowdma/benchmfc.}

	abstract = {5G's service providers now leverage Deep Learning (DL) to automate their network slice management, provisioning, and security. To this end, each slice owner contributes data to feed a common dataset used to train centralized learning models. However, this method raises privacy considerations that prevent its usage. Therefore, Federated learning (FL), a collaborative approach that ensures data privacy, is being investigated while striving toward the same performance as centralized learning. As 5G and beyond services are so diverse, the local slice's data is not intended to reflect the entire data distribution. Thus, local data of slices are Non-Independently and non-Identically distributed (Non-IID), posing a challenge for FL-based models. In this paper, we investigate the use of FL to secure network slices and detect potential attacks. For that purpose, we first propose an architecture for deploying intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in 5G and beyond networks. Next, we thoroughly evaluate the latest state-of-art FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedPer, and SCAFFOLD, in the context of Independently and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-IID data distributions. We compare these FL models to centralized and local DL models. We find that SCAFFOLD outperforms all the other FL algorithms and ensures a stable learning loss convergence, a promising finding that strengthens the case for leveraging FL in IDS development. Nevertheless, none of the FL models could achieve the centralized model's performance in Non-IID scenarios.}

Yet, its application in the cybersecurity space, one of the fastest-growing areas of risk for modern organisations, has been fragmented at best. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review on the application of the Three Lines of Defence model in cybersecurity. The model has been recently renamed the Three Lines Model. After the seminal publication by the Institute of Internal Auditors in 2013, academics and practitioners have either referenced this model as the primary governance framework for risk management or analysed it in depth in various areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review on the topic. We have performed a methodical analysis of existing research using best practices in the field and adopted the grounded theory approach as the theoretical underpinning of our investigation. This way, we unraveled details, critiques and possible alternatives to the Three Lines Model in cybersecurity.

	abstract = {Modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs) use the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect and exchange data efficiently, monitor device/sensor level interaction effectively, and adopt new standards effortlessly. Machine learning (ML) models are growingly used in the controllers of these IoT-enabled CPSs for pattern identification, state estimation, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, sophisticated adversaries can launch various attacks on the communication network and the hardware/firmware to introduce corrupted sensor measurements to manipulate the ML-based CPSs and create critical physical hazards. Hence, analyzing the threat space of a CPS is essential to understand the system's strength and identify the most vital resources to protect. However, existing studies have not proposed any verifiable solution for the threat analysis of ML-based CPSs. This paper presents a novel framework that uses efficient mechanisms to extract constraints from ML-based decision models and perform a formal threat analysis to identify potential false data injection (FDI) attack paths and corresponding effects on an IoT-enabled ML-based CPS. Our framework can provide us with all possible attack vectors, each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered for a CPS given a specific set of attack attributes. The attack vectors enable us to assess the system's resiliency, thus providing insight to enhance the system's robustness. We consider an internet of medical things-enabled safety-critical CPS naming smart healthcare system (SHS) as the reference case. We validate our framework on a real SHS dataset, proving our framework's success in revealing feasible FDI attack paths. Our evaluation using synthetic and two real SHS datasets also affirms the tool's efficacy in the threat analysis of ML-based CPSs.}

We then construct a system dynamics (SD) model to illustrate the model is applied to a case study based on a US government contract and evaluated.

	abstract = {The controller area network (CAN) protocol is a critical communication mechanism in vehicular systems. However, the widespread adoption of this protocol has introduced vulnerabilities to in-vehicle communication channels, making them susceptible to various security threats, including denial-of-service, fuzzy, and impersonation attacks. There is thus an urgent need to develop effective security measures to counter these threats. Unfortunately, existing approaches to attack detection suffer from shortcomings such as suboptimal accuracy and high false-positive rates. Herein, we propose a novel methodology to address these limitations, DivaCAN. DivaCAN leverages an ensemble of classifiers, including deep neural networks, the multi-layer perceptron, the light gradient-boosting machine, extra trees, random forest, and Bagging, along with k-nearest neighbors, for intrusion-attack recognition on the CAN bus. The DivaCAN model was thoroughly evaluated, and its exceptional performance, which surpasses that of the latest methodologies, was demonstrated. It was found to achieve a precision of 94.93%, a recall of 94.98%, and an\nF\n1\nscore of 94.97%. One notable aspect of this research is the emphasis on achieving a low false-positive rate, which is often overlooked by other methodologies. Additionally, the DivaCAN model was found to exhibit an acceptable execution time of 406 s, highlighting the importance of considering both accuracy and efficiency when evaluating the performance of classification models. This study thus significantly enhances the security of in-vehicle communication on the CAN protocol. DivaCAN is a robust and accurate intrusion-detection system that addresses the pressing need for effective security measures in vehicular systems.}

	abstract = {Zero-day attacks from highly dynamic and complex cyberspace make severe threats to the existing network intrusion detection systems. Robust and intelligent solutions are required to handle the rapidly evolving threats from internet environment. In this paper, a novel active learning framework based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) is proposed for zero-day attacks detection. The framework is composed of network intrusion detection systems classifier, sample selection strategy and annotator. Deep Q-Network model serves as an intelligent control component to select the zero-day samples for labeling with the probability distribution. Moreover, the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network is integrated into DQN model to form the selecting policy to analyze the temporal correlation within the static classification context. Meanwhile, Euclidean distance function is adopted for labeling the selected samples to achieve an accurate labeling result. Two famous datasets named NSL_KDD and UNSW_NB15 in intrusion detection field are tested for evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. Compared to other machine learning methods, the approach proposed in this paper demonstrates better universality and generalizability. This indicates that the method is more capable of reliably identifying and detecting network intrusion behaviors, which holds significant importance for further security research and practical applications.}

	abstract = {For a long time, malware classification and analysis have been an arms-race between antivirus systems and malware authors. Though static analysis is vulnerable to evasion techniques, it is still popular as the first line of defense in antivirus systems. But most of the static analyzers failed to gain the trust of practitioners due to their black-box nature. We propose MAlign, a novel static malware family classification approach inspired by genome sequence alignment that can not only classify malware families but can also provide explanations for its decision. MAlign encodes raw bytes using nucleotides and adopts genome sequence alignment approaches to create a signature of a malware family based on the conserved code segments in that family, without any human labor or expertise. We evaluate MAlign on two malware datasets, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning-based malware classifiers (by\n4.49\n%\n∼\n0.07\n%\n), especially on small datasets (by\n19.48\n%\n∼\n1.2\n%\n). Furthermore, we explain the generated signatures by MAlign on different malware families illustrating the kinds of insights it can provide to analysts, and show its efficacy as an analysis tool. Additionally, we evaluate its theoretical and empirical robustness against some common attacks. In this paper, we approach static malware analysis from a unique perspective, aiming to strike a delicate balance among performance, interpretability, and robustness.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning method that effectively protects personal data. Many studies on federated learning assumed that all clients have consistent privacy parameters. However, in practice, different clients have different privacy requirements, and heterogeneous differential privacy can personalize privacy protection according to each client's privacy budget and requirements. In this study, we propose an improved efficient FL privacy preservation method with heterogeneous differential privacy, which can compute the corresponding privacy budget weights for each client according to noise size using the secure differential privacy stochastic gradient descent protocol, histogram of oriented gradients feature extraction and weighted averaging of the heterogeneous privacy budgets. Through this method, the noisier clients are given smaller privacy budgets weights to mitigate their negative impact on the aggregation model. Experiments comparing the baseline method were performed on the MNIST, fMNIST and cifar10 datasets. More precisely, the experimental results showed that our method improves the model accuracy by 6.68% and 7.18% of 20 to 50 clients and 16.08% and 17.37% of 60 to 100 clients, respectively. Moreover, the communication overhead time was reduced by 23.85%, which validates the effectiveness and usability of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become popular due to its flexibility and agility in network management, enabling rapid adaptation to changing business requirements, enhancing network performance, and reducing operational costs. However, the ubiquity of internet-based services has given rise to an alarming increase in cyber-attacks, posing serious threats to the security and stability of modern networks. Among these attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as one of the most devastating, capable of disrupting critical services. Recent studies have shown that Deep Learning (DL) techniques with Software-defined networking have the potential to mitigate these threats effectively. However, existing solutions suffer from issues such as reliance on pre-defined rules and signatures, computational efficiency, low detection rates, and inefficient notification mechanisms, making them ineffective in detecting DDoS attacks. This paper proposes an efficient approach (BRS + CNN) using Balanced Random Sampling (BRS) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect DDoS attacks in SDN environments. We have applied various mitigation techniques to mitigate these threats, such as filtering, rate limiting, and iptables rule for blocking spoofed IPs. In addition, we introduce a monitoring system that utilizes rate-limiting to oversee blocked IP addresses, ensuring that legitimate traffic is processed efficiently. The proposed model achieves high performance in binary and multi-classification, with an accuracy of over 99.99% for binary classification and 98.64% for multi-classification. Our proposed DDoS detection system not only detects the attack but also sends detailed contextual information to a designated email address. We compare our model with existing literature and demonstrate its superiority using Area Under The Curve (AUC) analysis. Moreover, we evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed DDoS mitigation system by conducting a series of experiments across three distinct scenarios: Attack-Free, Attack-No Mitigation, and Attack-Mitigation. These results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed mitigation system in effectively combating DDoS attacks while also safeguarding the seamless continuity of regular network operations.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, the traditional access control model has faced challenges in meeting the demands of practical applications. As a result, the ABAC model has emerged as a more flexible and adaptable solution, gaining popularity among enterprises. However, constructing an ABAC policy set for heterogeneous access control systems (DAC, MAC, RBAC and other non-ABAC systems) has proven to be complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an ABAC policy mining method based on a clustering algorithm, aiming to extract ABAC policies from access control logs and facilitate the heterogeneous policy migration. Regardless of the access control model used by the original system, its security intent can be reflected by the access control logs. Our method segments and encodes log information using a decision tree, generating a matrix representation that characterizes the logs. Hierarchical clustering is then employed to group similar logs into clusters and extract attribute relationships, thus constructing the ABAC policy set. Additionally, policy optimization techniques such as policy pruning, refinement, and analysis are applied to enhance the policy set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving 5.7 %\nF\n−\ns\nc\no\nr\ne\nimprovement and 41.4 % WSC decrease compared to the comparison method. Moreover, when applied to noisy and sparse logs, our method achieves 12.5 %\nF\n−\ns\nc\no\nr\ne\nimprovement while reducing the WSC by 29.4 %.}

	abstract = {Domain Name System (DNS) amplification attacks exploit botnets and open recursive DNS servers to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. During an attack, the attacker leverages infected computers (bots) to perpetually send small spoofed DNS queries to numerous open recursive DNS servers. The servers, in turn, respond with lots of large DNS responses, which are reflected back to the victim. Such responses are usually several times larger than the original queries, and could exhaust the resources of CPUs, memory, and network bandwidth, rendering them unavailable for benign users. However, most in-network DDoS mitigation systems today inevitably cause normal DNS responses to be discarded while scrubbing traffic, as they do not distinguish between legitimate and malicious responses. To address this issue, some existing solutions employ Bloom filters to filter out unsolicited DNS responses, utilizing the “one-to-one mapping” relationship between DNS queries and responses.}

	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are primarily designed to flag security breaches upon their occurrence. These systems operate under the assumption of single-label data, where each instance is assigned to a single category. However, when dealing with complex data, such as malware triage, the information provided by the IDS is limited. Consequently, additional analysis becomes necessary, leading to delays and incurring additional computational costs. Existing solutions to this problem typically merge these steps by considering a unified, but large, label set encompassing both intrusion and analytical labels, which adversely affects efficiency and performance. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for multi-label classification by employing an ensemble of sequential models that preserve the original label sets during training. Each model focuses on learning the distribution specifically related to its assigned set of labels, independent of the other label sets. To capture the relationship between different sets of labels, the parameters of each trained model initialize the subsequent model, ensuring that information from unrelated label sets does not interfere with the learning objective. Consequently, the proposed method enhances prediction performance without increasing computational complexity. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset related to intrusion detection. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in handling multi-label classification tasks.}

By leveraging an e-graph data structure, Wasm-Mutate is implemented to meet both speed and efficacy. We evaluate Wasm-Mutate by conducting experiments on 404 programs, which include real-world applications. Our results highlight that Wasm-Mutate can produce tens of thousands of unique and efficient WebAssembly variants within minutes. Significantly, Wasm-Mutate can safeguard WebAssembly binaries against timing side-channel attacks, especially those of the Spectre type.}

	abstract = {This study presents VDTriplet, a novel learning framework for building vulnerability detection models. VDTriplet is the first attempt using deep learning to avoid the potential known vulnerability function misjudgment due to the small difference between vulnerability and its fixed vulnerability function. Unlike prior work that treats the program as sequential tokens or randomly initialized graphs for supervised binary classification detection tasks, our model not only fuses rich syntactic and semantic information to obtain the most accurate program representation, but also utilizes the TripletNN model to reduce misjudgment of potential known vulnerabilities. VDTriplet first extracts the subgraphs that causes the vulnerability through the typical programming errors to reduce redundant code. Then, it uses the pre-trained model and unsupervised model for the graph encoding of subgraphs, thereby minimizing the influence of randomly initialized graph nodes and avoiding the need for supervised labeling. Finally, TripletNN model minimizes the distance between potential vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with the same vulnerability type, and maximizes the distance between potential vulnerabilities and fixed vulnerabilities to reduce false positives. The results show that the performance of VDTriplet is significantly better than the studied baselines. Compared with the best performing model in the literature, our model achieves a total of 4.89%, 4.23%, 4.56% and 5.34% improvement in Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score in the test results respectively. Moreover, it exhibits well generalization in detecting new eight applications, demonstrating that it is potentially valuable in practical usage. Overall, this is indeed an outstanding improvement.}

This study conducts a systematic review of the literature to delve into the utilization of GANs for network anomaly detection, with a specific emphasis on representation learning rather than merely data augmentation.

The method focuses on the similarity relationship between malware variants and raw binary, Opcode operands, and API calls to create images with rich textures representing deeper dependent features. Using the atrous spatial pyramid pooling to enhance the transfer learning-based EfficientNet model to resolve the data loss and redundancy issue caused by image size normalization, thus improving its accuracy. The proposed algorithm refines the above two algorithms by utilizing a fusion classifier and a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize BiTCN-TAEfficientNet.

Proactive defense efforts have led to the adoption of malware scoring, allowing analysts to assess the severity and develop countermeasures. These scores indicate the degree of malware maliciousness based on triggered signatures. However, current scoring methods do not precisely depict the true extent of malware's maliciousness. This inaccuracy is attributed to an inadequate assessment of the impact of behaviour corresponding to signatures on both system and network resources. To address this limitation, the paper proposes a novel scoring approach that accurately quantifies the impact of signatures triggered by malware through co-occurrence analysis. The method assesses the ensemble behaviour of signatures across two phases. In the first phase of signature scoring, an impact score quantification algorithm initializes each signature to predefined severity score bands based on the studied severity and frequency. The second phase refines initial scores iteratively, considering mutual information among signatures co-occurring in the malware's execution. Experimental results validate the proposed method's ability to accurately reflect signature maliciousness. This novel scoring method enhances malware analysis platforms in generating more precise scores compared to traditional methods, thereby improving resilience against evolving malware threats in the dynamic cybersecurity landscape.}

	abstract = {Phishing attacks are a critical and escalating cybersecurity threat in the modern digital landscape. As cybercriminals continually adapt their techniques, automated phishing detection systems have become essential for safeguarding Internet users. However, many current systems rely on single-analysis models, making them vulnerable to sophisticated bypass attempts by hackers. This research delves into the potential of hybrid approaches, which combine multiple models to enhance both the robustness and effectiveness of phishing detection. It highlights existing hybrid models' limitations that focus primarily on effectiveness while ignoring broader applicability. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel framework explicitly designed for applicability in the real world, which poses the foundation for practical and robust phishing detection architectures. We develop a proof of concept to evaluate its effectiveness, robustness, and detection speed. Additionally, we introduce an innovative methodology for simulating bypass attacks on single-analysis base models. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms individual models, displaying higher effectiveness, robustness against bypassing attempts, and real-time detection capabilities. Our proof of concept achieves an accuracy of 97.44% thereby outperforming the current state-of-the-art approach while requiring less computational time. The results provide insights into the multifaceted factors of hybrid models, extending beyond mere effectiveness, and emphasize the importance of holistic applicability in hybrid approaches to address the critical need for robust defenses against phishing attacks.}

	abstract = {Digitization increases business opportunities and the risk of companies being victims of devastating cyberattacks. Therefore, managing risk exposure and cybersecurity strategies is essential for digitized companies that aim to survive in competitive markets. However, understanding company-specific risks and quantifying their associated costs is not trivial. Current approaches fail to approximate the individualized financial impact of cyber incidents with a monetary estimation. Additionally, due to limited resources and technical expertise, SMEs, but also large companies, struggle to quantify their cyberattack exposure. Therefore, novel approaches must be built to contribute to a better understanding of the financial loss associated with cyberattacks. This article introduces the Real Cyber Value at Risk (RCVaR), an economical approach for estimating cybersecurity costs using real-world information from public cybersecurity reports. RCVaR identifies the most significant cyber risk factors from various sources and combines their quantitative results to estimate specific cyberattack costs for companies. Furthermore, RCVaR extends current methods to achieve cost and risk estimations based on historical real-world data instead of only probability-based simulations. The evaluation of the approach on unseen data shows the high accuracy and efficiency of the RCVaR in predicting and managing cyber risks. Thus, we argue that the RCVaR is a valuable addition to cybersecurity planning and risk management processes.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage auditing allows the data owner/verifier to check whether the cloud correctly stores data owners' data. In cloud storage auditing scenario, data ownership transfer is a non-negligible problem. However, the existing cloud storage auditing schemes supporting data ownership transfer suffer from complex certificate management issue or key escrow threat. Thus, how to realize data ownership transfer in cloud storage auditing while avoiding complex certificate management and key escrow is a challenge. To address the above challenge, we propose a certificateless cloud storage auditing scheme supporting data ownership transfer. We design a novel authenticator transformation method that is compatible with certificateless signature. When data ownership is transferred, the integrity of transferred data still can be verified by transforming the authenticators of the previous data owner into the valid authenticators of the new data owner. Furthermore, our scheme tackles the challenges of certificate management and key escrow. The security and effectiveness of our scheme are substantiated by the security analysis and the experimental results.}

	abstract = {The challenge of achieving passwordless user authentication is real given the prevalence of web applications that keep asking passwords. Complicating this issue further, in an enterprise environment, a single sign-on (SSO) service is often maintained but not all applications can be integrated with it. We envision a passwordless future which provides a frictionless and trustworthy online experience for users by integrating credential management and federated identity systems. In this regard, our implementation ROSTAM offers a dashboard that presents all applications the user can access with a single click after a passwordless SSO. The security of web passwords on the credential manager is ensured with a Master Key, rather than a Master Password, so that encrypted passwords can remain secure even if stolen from the server. We propose and implement novel techniques for synchronization (pairing) and recovery of this Master Key. We compare our solution to previous work using different evaluation frameworks, demonstrating that our hybrid solution combines the benefits of credential management and federated identity systems.}

	abstract = {Federated learning systems enable data localization by aggregating model parameters from all parties for global model training, but they also expose new security threats due to their distributed learning approach and multi-party heterogeneous data distribution. Backdoor attacks exploit the inability of federated learning systems to audit client data, and have a huge advantage in injecting backdoor into global models by submitting poisoned model updates. That causes the global model to be backdoored after the aggregation model updates, leading to catastrophic model security problems. Current existing studies used a distributed strategy to deploy backdoor attack in federated learning, however, the attack persistence is not good enough. To achieve better attack performance, this paper proposes a novel backdoor attack method against federated learning systems, which we name Shadow Backdoor Attack (SBA). Our SBA method innovates on attack deployment and creatively introduces a new concept of Attacker Intensity, which distinguish the different roles of attackers in backdoor attack against federated learning. SBA implements attacks through a combination of different intensities attackers, which makes the sustained effect of the attack significantly improved compared with previous work. Several experiments demonstrate that SBA has a high attack success rate and more sustained attack effect. Moreover, we analyze the impact of trigger criteria in SBA and confirm the attack effectiveness of SBA against two robust FL algorithms.}

	abstract = {Research on federated learning has continued to develop over the past few years. Many federated learning algorithms and frameworks have been developed to ensure model accuracy and protect client data privacy, which has been extensively beneficial for the development of artificial intelligence security technology. However, it is possible to recover private training data from publicly shared gradients, which is referred to as a data leakage attack. In this paper, we propose two feasible defense methods, based on gradient sparsification and pseudo-gradient, to defend against the state-of-the-art attack methods and achieve maximum protection of the private data of all federated learning participants. Both methods use cosine similarity to measure the angular difference between the gradients updated by the clients during training and the gradients sent back by the server. Taking the cosine similarity as a reference and aiming to protect clients' privacy while maintaining the accuracy of the global model, the clients can choose an appropriate strategy for disguising their uploaded gradient. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both defense methods can protect users' private data while preserving the accuracy of the global model in federated learning.}
