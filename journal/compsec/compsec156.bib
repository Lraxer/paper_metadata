	abstract = {SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are critical for managing industrial processes, including energy production, manufacturing, and transportation. However, their reliance on protocols such as Modbus, which lack inherent security features, exposes them to sophisticated cyber threats. This paper explores vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol to design advanced SCADA-specific attack scenarios—SCADA Hijacking and SCADA Blackout. These covert attacks exploit protocol weaknesses to manipulate process parameters or halt operations while evading detection by  intrusion detection  systems (IDS) and  human operators , representing a significant escalation in the sophistication of cyber threats. To counter these threats, we propose a novel machine learning-based defense mechanism that incorporates heterogeneous graph embeddings, combining multimodal network data such as flow-level and packet-level features. The proposed attacks and defense mechanism were rigorously evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rate as key metrics, demonstrating the stealthiness of the attacks and the robustness of the defense. By exposing critical vulnerabilities and presenting an advanced  intrusion detection  framework, this research establishes a foundation for strengthening SCADA systems against evolving cyber threats, ensuring the security and reliability of  industrial control systems .}

	abstract = {The recent advances in  Federated Learning  (FL) and its promise of privacy-preserving information sharing have led to a  renewed interest  in the development of collaborative models for  Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDSs). However, its distributed nature makes FL vulnerable to malicious contributions from its participants, including data poisoning attacks. Label-flipping attacks — where the labels of a subset of the  training data  are flipped — have been overlooked in the context of IDSs that leverage FL primitives. This work contributes to closing this gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of the impact of label-flipping attacks on Federated  Intrusion Detection Systems  (FIDSs). We show that the effects of such attacks can range from severe to highly mitigated, depending on hyperparameters and dataset characteristics, and that their mitigation is non-trivial in heterogeneous settings. We discuss these findings in the context of existing literature and propose recommendations for the evaluation of FIDSs. Finally, we provide a methodology and tools to extend our findings to other models and datasets, thus enabling the comparable evaluation of existing and future countermeasures.}

	abstract = {Standardized  Vehicular Communication  (VC), mainly Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) and Decentralized Environmental  Notification Messages  (DENMs), is paramount to vehicle safety, carrying vehicle status information and reports of traffic/road-related events respectively. Broadcasted CAMs and DENMs are pseudonymously authenticated for security and privacy protection, with each node needing to have all incoming messages validated within an expiration deadline. This creates an asymmetry that can be easily exploited by external adversaries to launch a clogging Denial of Service (DoS) attack: each forged VC message forces all neighboring nodes to cryptographically validate it; at increasing rates, easy to generate forged messages gradually exhaust  processing resources  and severely degrade or deny timely validation of benign CAMs/DENMs. The result can be catastrophic when awareness of neighbor vehicle positions or critical reports are missed. We address this problem making the standardized VC pseudonymous  authentication DoS-resilient . We propose efficient cryptographic constructs, which we term message verification  facilitators , to prioritize processing resources for verification of potentially valid messages among bogus messages and verify multiple messages based on one signature verification. Any message acceptance is strictly based on public-key based message authentication/verification for  accountability , i.e.,  non-repudiation  is not sacrificed, unlike symmetric key based approaches. This further enables drastic  misbehavior detection , also exploiting the newly introduced facilitators, based on probabilistic signature verification and cross-checking over multiple facilitators verifying the same message; while maintaining verification latency low even when under attack, trading off modest  communication overhead . Our facilitators can also be used for efficient discovery and verification of  DENM  or any  event-driven message , including  misbehavior evidence  used for our scheme. Even when vehicles are saturated by adversaries mounting a clogging  DoS  attack, transmitting high-rate bogus CAMs/DENMs, our scheme achieves an average  50 m s <math><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">50</mn><mspace width="1em" class="nbsp" is="true"></mspace><mi is="true">m</mi><mi is="true">s</mi></mrow></math>  verification delay with message expiration ratio less than 1% - a huge improvement over the current standard that verifies every message signature in a First-Come First-Served (FCFS) manner and suffers from having 50% to nearly 100% of the received benign messages expiring.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control Systems  (ICS) are designed to provide a service, such as  power generation  or  water treatment , while protecting people, assets, and the environment against hazard. However, ICS now integrate Information Technology (IT) and are interconnected with the outside world such as the Internet, thereby exposing their infrastructures to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks have thus become new threats for industrial system operations and, more specifically, for their safety. To address the issue, this paper presents a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for the safety of ICS. We apply our method to automate industrial cybersecurity risk assessment as specified in the recent (2020) IEC 62443-3-2 standard, which is widely used in the industrial cybersecurity domain. By automating parts of these  risk assessment processes , we can reduce the error-prone manual efforts and increase the consistency of risk assessment. More specifically, the proposed risk assessment comprises three parts which, respectively: (1) identify the specific vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, (2) determine the attack scenarios that compromise the safety of the system and (3) assess whether the attack scenarios are tolerable by the organization’s policy. In the first part, we automated the entire threat modeling process of  Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool  by developing an automatable method for building the system model, in the form of a  data flow diagram , from a standard XML file called PLCOpen. This automation of the Microsoft Threat  Modeling Tool process  enables us to automate vulnerability identification for industrial control systems. In the second part, we enhance a previous work that generates theoretical safety-compromising attack scenarios by building a complete attack scenario from system vulnerabilities to safety compromise. Finally, in the third part, we rank the attack scenarios using a specific  risk matrix  in order to determine which scenarios exceed the risk tolerable by the organization and therefore require additional controls.}

Applying packing to the original  executable code  renders extracting meaningful features and signatures challenging. To deal with the increasing amount of malware in the wild, researchers and anti-malware companies started harnessing  machine learning  capabilities with very promising results. However, little is known about the effects of packing on static machine learning-based malware detection and classification systems. This work addresses this gap by investigating the impact of packing on the performance of static machine learning-based models used for malware detection and classification, with a particular focus on those using visualization techniques. To this end, we present a comprehensive analysis of various packing techniques and their effects on the performance of machine learning-based detectors and classifiers.

Empirical measures of success are important for practitioners that are struggling to meet the current demands for expertise. But no previous work has investigated the role of these diagrams during the validation of identified security threats. This paper presents an experiment conducted with 98 students in two countries. We measured the impact of the DFD on the perceived and actual effectiveness of validating a list of identified security threats including both fabricated and actual threats. In presence of  sequence diagrams , the participants perceived DFDs as more useful. However, when exposed to both a DFD and a sequence diagram, DFDs had no significant impact on the participants’ ability to validate security threats.}

	abstract = {With the increasing  Android applications , the problem of  malicious behavior  in  Android applications  is growing. Some applications are hostile in their design, and some collect excessive information in use and behave in a user-unexpected way. Existing application’s security detection methods include static and dynamic analysis, with limitations such as single detection methods, poorly integrated detection, and failure to consider user expectations. Therefore, based on the behavior of the Android application, this paper proposes a comprehensive mobile applications detection mechanism combining  static analysis , dynamic analysis, and users’ subjective expectations. This paper introduces permission  relevancy  in static detection to enhance the fine grain of permission-based static detection. Moreover, the historical confidence in dynamic analysis quantitates the applications’  behavior characteristics , and the low efficiency is compensated. Static analysis can guide the dynamic analysis and improve the accuracy and coverage rate. We introduce subjective expectations to private objects and a comprehensive monitoring mechanism during the assessment process. An experiment based on real-world Android applications is carried out to validate the scheme in this paper. According to the Android application test analysis, the proposed mechanism can quantitate and assess the software security based on different users’  degrees of privacy  concerns. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed system achieves a recognition rate of 97.27% for identifying malicious behaviors in test application. The proposed mechanism is more accurate than only  static analysis , more efficient than only dynamic analysis, and the degree of danger can be adjusted according to the user’s subjective expectations.}

These attacks have become increasingly threatening to modern software systems, which rely heavily on  human interactions . Recent studies propose to conduct serious game-based security training against such threats. However, it is challenging to simulate real-world scenarios in serious games, making the training less effective. In this paper, we introduce Security Awareness Adventure, a novel social engineering serious game that allows participants to play the role of attackers and realistically experience the social engineering attack process from the attacker’s perspective. Our game works with  state transition  models to realistically simulate stakeholder interactions within specific scenarios and to capture stakeholders’ alternative behaviors using a branching system. To evaluate our game’s effectiveness, we conducted an experiment with 41 participants and a real social  engineering security  scenario. The experimental results show that our game can effectively improve the learner’s security awareness.}

	abstract = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve driving safety and comfort, but they still face cybersecurity risks.  Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) have now become the primary means of addressing this problem. There are two weaknesses in existing studies that consider sensor correlation. First, few studies focus on the degree of correlation between sensors. Second, existing studies usually focus only on  anomaly detection  and ignore the precise location of attack targets. In this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection system based on in-vehicle sensors spatio-temporal information. The first stage is set as a behavior predictor, which uses  historical data  to predict current data. Where the spatial Multi-head Graph Attention (MGAT) layer considers the degree of correlation among sensors through the attention weights in the graph structure, and the temporal Multi-head Graph Attention layer models the dependence of data at different time points of a single sensor. In the second phase, the  attack detector  first  detects anomalies  based on the deviation between predicted and observed values, after which a threshold deviation ratio is introduced to locate the attacked sensor. Experimental results in real vehicle data sets show that the proposed system can efficiently detect multiple types of attacks with an average F1 score of 98.28%, which is at least 1.45% higher than the existing methods. In various single-sensor attack scenarios, the accuracy of identifying attack targets exceeds 97.00%.}

Intelligent Transportation (IoT) is a fast-growing field in computer science, but it's also vulnerable to various types of assaults due to the increasingly dangerous nature of the Internet. To secure IoT networks, the DeepDetectNet++ framework is proposed to identify and detect intrusions in  IIoT  systems and strengthen the  IIoT  system's security. The need for this research is informed by the fact that Intelligent Transportation IoT systems are becoming more exposed to complex cyberattacks that endanger the core functions of the systems. The goal is to design and implement a new generation  intrusion detection system , DeepDetectNet++, that combines hybrid optimization and improved  deep learning algorithms  to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and effectiveness of IIoT attack identification and categorization. Two IIoT datasets are used and they are preprocessed using  outliers detection  and missing values handling techniques. Moreover, the feature extraction phase extracts temporal features, flow-based features, and frequency domain features. A hybrid  optimization strategy  such as the Hybrid Pelican and Dragonfly Optimization (HPDF) technique is employed in the feature selection to identify the most  discriminative features . Finally, a DeepDetectNet++ model is proposed to improve SKA-ResNet's model and Spatiotemporal Self-Attention (STSA)-Based LSTNet component to enhance the detection and classification performance of the developed model. The experimental results of the designed technique are validated with existing models and the developed model gained an accuracy of 98.3%, sensitivity of 97.75%, and F-measure of 98.3%. The developed model detects and classifies IIoT attacks accurately and with high efficiency.}

	abstract = {Chronicles of the last few years show that industrial Cyber–Physical Systems are the target of dangerous cyber-attacks and face multiple threats. It is important to react as promptly as possible to such attacks and take proper countermeasures.  Anomaly detection  is a key activity in a Cyber–Physical System’s defense strategy. It involves analyzing sensor data, modeled as a  Multivariate Time Series , to identify deviations from expected behavior, that may indicate potential cyber threats or attacks. In this paper, we design a novel framework integrating spatial and temporal modules to unveil spatio-temporal dependencies within sensor data in Cyber–Physical Systems to detect possible intrusions. We propose a novel strategy based on time series correlation to build a graph minimizing the number of sensors’ connections to unveil  spatial dependencies  between multimodal time series. The prediction and reconstruction losses are then leveraged to  detect anomalies . The proposed framework has been evaluated on a real-world Cyber–Physical System, on which we evaluated both the efficacy and efficiency with respect to different competing approaches. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework outperforms eight state-of-the-art ones by increasing the precision of 0.59% while reducing both the training time (21.05%) for each epoch and memory occupation (77.8%) with respect to the best competitor in the literature. These characteristics make it particularly suitable for industrial environments that need periodic  reconfigurations .}

	abstract = {As network attacks become increasingly frequent, ensuring the effectiveness of network  intrusion detection systems  remains critical to  network security . Hybrid metaheuristic-based feature selection methods suffer from poor initial population quality, slow convergence speed, and a tendency to fall into local  optimality  when processing high-dimensional data. These issues reduce the efficiency and accuracy of  network intrusion detection . To address these challenges, a hybrid  metaheuristic  feature selection method,  HMDOA , is proposed. This method enhances detection efficiency and accuracy by optimizing the feature selection process. In the population  initialization stage , an enhanced population generation mechanism is introduced to increase the diversity of initial solutions in the  feature space  distribution and improve the quality of selected feature subsets. During the feature evaluation stage, an adaptive weighting parameter is introduced to accelerate convergence and enhance feature selection efficiency. Additionally, dynamic search mechanisms are integrated using a dynamic strategy to prevent  local optimization  effectively. Three public  network intrusion detection  datasets—NSL-KDD, CIC_MalMem_2022, and RT_IOT2022—are used to evaluate the performance of the  HMDOA  method. Its performance is then compared with six other  metaheuristic algorithms . Experimental results indicate that the  HMDOA  method achieves higher feature selection efficiency, faster convergence speed, and higher-quality solutions. The  HMDOA  method significantly improves the effect of network traffic feature selection, but the robustness of the algorithm under the background of noise and data anomalies needs to be further explored in the future.}

	abstract = {With the development of  IoT  and mobile sensing devices,  trajectory data  has an increasingly high research value. However, unauthorized  data mining  and analyzing will result in privacy violations. Therefore, the key issue is how to maintain user privacy while publishing usable data. To address the above problem, we propose a spatiotemporal trajectory  data generalization  publishing scheme with  differential privacy  (STG-DP), which consists of two components: trajectory processing and trajectory publishing. In trajectory processing, to improve data utility, a density-based trajectory clustering framework (DTC) is proposed, integrating two  clustering algorithms  to compare the impact of synthetic and real cluster centers on experimental results. In terms of trajectory publishing, an adaptive noise  perturbation mechanism  based on the staircase mechanism is proposed to enhance the  degree of privacy  protection. We theoretically prove that STG-DP satisfies the definition of  differential privacy  and experimentally verify it on a real dataset. The experiments demonstrate that STG-DP provides greater data utility and privacy protection than existing studies.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of  IoT  networks has heightened vulnerabilities in  IoT devices , making them targets for sophisticated attackers. These vulnerabilities compromise sensitive user data and disrupt services for legitimate users. Therefore, securing  IoT  devices is a crucial research area to protect against cyber-attacks and fully realize the benefits of IoT technologies. Various solutions have already been proposed, including firewalls, antivirus software, and  intrusion detection  systems (IDS). Firewalls and antivirus software provide only some level of security by filtering known threats and blocking unauthorized access; they primarily rely on  predefined rules  and filter the packet according to rules without monitoring its behavior in the network. The firewall functions in either inline mode or  transparent mode  at the network boundary. In contrast, IDS offers more comprehensive protection by continuously monitoring network traffic and system activities, employing both signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to identify previously unseen threats (or zero-day attacks). It typically functions in monitoring mode rather than inline with the traffic flow. However, designing an effective IDS for IoT environments presents significant challenges. The limited  computational resources  of  IoT devices  make it difficult to process high-dimensional IDS datasets efficiently. On the other hand, dataset imbalance is another major hurdle (as it hinders the accurate identification of intrusive activities, leading to biased detection performance) in the design of efficient  intrusion detection systems . To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid  network intrusion detection system  that integrates advanced oversampling, feature selection techniques, and intelligent detection models to enhance the attack detection accuracy and reduce the processing time of  intrusion detection  in IoT networks. Firstly, the imbalanced IDS dataset is balanced with the help of the modified generative adversarial minority oversampling (GAMO) and fuzzy C-means  clustering techniques . In the proposed framework, the existing GAMO model is modified by integrating the  attention mechanism  to focus on significant patterns in the network traffic and achieve efficacious performance. Hyperparameters of the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm are optimized using the OPTUNA technique. Secondly, feature selection is performed using the modified  Grey Wolf Optimization  (GWO) technique by integrating the  correlation coefficient  in the  initialization stage  and introducing a novel objective function. This modified feature selection approach reduces the  resource constraint  and is compatible with IoT networks. Signature-based IDS (SIDS) is designed using the majority voting classifier to detect known attacks. The voting  classifier ensembles  seven tree-based models, which are optimized using the OPTUNA technique. On the other hand, anomaly-based IDS (AIDS) is proposed, which utilizes the double deep Q-network for unknown  DoS attack  detection. The proposed “ARLHNIDS-IoT” model integrates SIDS and AIDS in such a way that the incoming IoT-based network traffic is first analyzed by SIDS, which compares it to a database of known attack signatures. When a match is found, the attack is promptly classified, facilitating rapid detection of known threats. If SIDS fails to recognize an attack, the traffic is forwarded to AIDS for further assessment. AIDS inspects any deviations from normal behavior to identify new attacks. The proposed strategy enhances accuracy, minimizes false alarms, and bolsters IoT security. The effectiveness of the proposed “ARLHNIDS-IoT” model is evaluated using three IoT-based datasets: UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023. Experimental findings from the UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 datasets indicate that the proposed method lessens resource limitations by decreasing prediction time by 5.917, 13.523, and 37.751 s, respectively. Additionally, it tackles the  imbalanced data  challenge by improving recall by 6.06 %, 8.12 %, and 3.86 % while enhancing the F1-score by 5.69 %, 7.95 %, and 2.65 % on UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 datasets, respectively. The accuracy of the SIDS model is observed as 92.89 %, 99.19 %, and 98.31 % on UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 datasets, respectively, and the accuracy of the AIDS model is observed as 89.56 %, 90.92 %, and 94.74 % on UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 datasets, respectively. The proposed model is evaluated against recent state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating that the “ARLHNIDS-IoT” model surpasses other contemporary methods.}

	abstract = {Security controls are indispensable in today’s technology-driven world for their essential role in protecting applications and systems in many organizations. They help to manage the organizational controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity and access to vital infrastructure and data (e.g., software applications, financial records, personal information, intellectual property, etc.) by ensuring that only authorized and trustworthy users have privileged access. Further, integrating security controls within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is imperative for detecting application deficiencies and preventing potential breaches that could result in financial losses and expose the systems to external and/or internal threats. They reduce the exploitation risk by identifying and patching vulnerabilities in applications and networks within the organization. To explore and get in-depth insights, a survey was conducted with 118 software practitioners to determine how they embed and handle security controls in software development environments. Our survey covers the four phases of the security controls lifecycle, including classifying, identifying, implementing, and validating security controls to understand the best practices and essential activities in each process. The survey results indicated that most respondents recognized the critical importance of understanding security requirements prior to integrating appropriate security controls in each software release. We highlighted key factors that influence the selection and identification of security controls, including user group considerations, risk management practices, and organizational requirements. It appeared that security practitioners utilize a wide range of security controls that are broadly classified into six categories, where administrative and technical controls come first. With this emphasis and awareness, they could align their responses with practical and contextual factors driving effective security control implementation. Furthermore, the findings showed that most organizations rely on internal departments to implement and maintain security controls in conjunction with continuous security practices throughout the different phases of the SDLC. In contrast, only 36% of respondents utilize automated testing tools for monitoring, while 52% cite insufficient security training as a major obstacle. The survey highlighted the need to hire skillful security practitioners who possess a diverse range of cybersecurity skills, enabling them to govern security controls and handle troubleshooting with poise and professionalism, taking advantage of lessons learned in past experiences. The results also demonstrated the need for employing up-to-date tools and carrying out a list of best practices, to implement security controls and improve their effectiveness for the purpose of up-leveling the overall security posture. Those results emphasize the need for enhanced training programs and advanced tools to streamline security control integration. In addition, this study provides actionable insights for improving compliance and risk management, contributing to a more robust, comprehensive cybersecurity framework.}

	abstract = {Cybercrime  is often assumed to be limited to more mature  economic sectors . Yet, cybercrime is known to migrate to less tightly regulated domains—including online video gaming. Account compromise and virtual asset theft is a challenge that confronts the entire online video gaming  industry . Increasingly,  video game  companies are required to promptly identify malicious online activity and take prompt remedial action. This paper conducts a  social network analysis  of 358,054 Roblox users that participated in the Roblox virtual asset marketplace over a 12-month period. Results from a multiple  logistic regression  analysis provide  video game  companies with actionable findings that can be leveraged during the implementation of organizational security controls, including policy, governance mechanism and system design decisions. Key findings reveal that the prosocial nature of online gamers’ friendship circles play a central role in determining the likelihood that accounts are banned for malicious account activity. Third-party trading website usage, posting trade  advertisements  as part of a social engineering exploit, and the age of user accounts constitute further  risk factors  that should be accounted for when managing customer risk. To complement the  regression analysis , five classifiers were trained with social network-derived features. Cross-validated results show that network-derived features have strong  discriminative power  and should form part of a defense-in-depth approach to combatting cybercrime in online video gaming.}

	abstract = {Despite the massive use of antivirus on  personal computers ,  malicious applications  are on the rise. Nowadays, modern  malware  uses  browser extensions  rather than portable files. A three-month study found that Chrome users downloaded malicious extensions 33 million times. Some of these extensions received more than ten million installs. These malicious extensions captured keystrokes, including passwords, and screenshots. This work aims to create antivirus software to detect malicious Google Chrome extensions (CRX). Our engine runs the CRX suspicious sample to infect a monitored Windows OS in a controlled environment. In total, our antivirus monitors and considers 1098 actions that the suspicious CRX file can perform when executed. The audited behaviors serve as input neurons for author  neural networks . The aim is to recognize the pattern of malicious add-ons and separate them from benign ones. Instead of deep networks, authorial networks are of low  computational complexity . Due to the excellent results in different areas, there is a common belief that  deep learning  can always provide the best results. In fact, this consideration is false. To prove the theory, the author's antivirus uses shallow morphological  neural networks . Author antivirus is both accurate and efficient, based on  neural networks . The authorial antivirus can combine high accuracy with reduced learning time. The antivirus achieved a 99.99 % success rate in  detecting malware . It distinguished between benign CRX files and  malware . Training takes an average of 0.60 s. The researchers investigate different initial conditions, learning functions and antivirus architectures. Intelligent antiviruses can fix traditional antiviruses' flaws. They rely on a client's prior infection to act against new threats. Unlike this reactive approach, our antivirus detects harmful add-ons before the user triggers them. Unlike most traditional antiviruses, our antivirus works differently. It can detect the malicious  intent  of a suspicious add-on before the user clicks it. Our antivirus  detects malware  preventively rather than reactively. Our antivirus, also, is statistically superior to commercial and state-of-the-art antiviruses.}

	abstract = {In the  DNS  resolution, a recursive resolver receives requests from clients and queries the authoritative name servers to resolve domain names. In real networks, some recursive resolvers work as the ingress resolvers, which receive client requests but rely on egress resolvers to communicate with authoritative name servers. This dependency on egress resolvers introduces two issues. First, the failure of egress resolvers can delay or disrupt the resolution of ingress resolvers. Second, dependency centralization constrains the  DNS  system to a limited number of resolvers and organizations, exposing the system to higher risks of availability issues and  cascading failures . Understanding the dependencies and centralization of recursive resolvers is essential for comprehending the DNS ecosystem. In this work, we investigate the recursive resolution implemented by open resolvers in IPv4 address space to quantify their dependencies. We propose a set of approaches to identify egress resolvers and third-party providers on which open resolvers depend, and we analyze the degree of dependency centralization from multiple perspectives. Our measurements reveal that open resolvers in the wild exhibit widespread and highly concentrated dependencies. Specifically, more than 1.7 million open resolvers depend on about 147,000 egress resolvers. 90% of open resolvers are influenced by 8.41% of egress resolvers, and 36.82% of open resolvers rely on only one egress resolver to perform resolution. Egress resolvers from third-party providers can influence more than 44.40% of the open resolvers. Our work demonstrates that dependencies in recursive resolution are concentrated on a small number of egress resolvers and third-party providers, significantly reducing DNS redundancy and threatening  system availability .}

	abstract = {Malware  refers to malicious software or a component of software intended for malicious purposes. The manual analysis and detection of malicious software is challenging due to its complexity. Thus, several automated solutions have become popular for real-time  malware detection . A spread-out approach consists of generating images from the samples bytecode and giving them to  convolutional neural networks  (CNNs), which are used either as classifiers or feature extractors for further  classification algorithms . These systems perform extremely well when trained and tested on partitions of the same dataset. However, cross-dataset tests and malware detection verification on emerging real-world samples are required in the real-world context. This is a crucial challenge when probing the robustness of the systems and models. This paper proposes CNN-AutoMIC,a robust automated approach to extract features from malware images. CNN-AutoMIC employs a specific  CNN architecture  to extract features, followed by an autoencoder-based compressor that reduces features to two fundamental components. The two-dimensional projection of these components is the basis of the predictions performed by the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. Moreover, the observable placement of new samples on the obtained scatter plot makes it possible to explain why the AI-based system produced a certain prediction. It was benchmarked against several CNN-based models and a  Vision Transformer . They were trained on the Malevis dataset and cross-dataset evaluated on four different real-world datasets. CNN-AutoMIC outperformed the competitors for each classification performance metric, while requiring a reasonable training and prediction time. In addition, it achieves a promising Akaike information criterion (AIC) score, indicating its efficiency in terms of model complexity.}

Network defense, supported by  Network Intrusion Detection Systems  (NIDSs), has also increasingly adopted data-driven approaches, leading to greater reliance on data. Despite the importance of data, its scarcity has long been recognized as a major obstacle in NIDS research. In response, the community has published many new datasets recently. However, many of them remain largely unknown and unanalyzed, leaving researchers uncertain about their suitability for specific use cases. In this paper, we aim to address this knowledge gap by performing a systematic literature review (SLR) of 89 public datasets for NIDS research. Each dataset is comparatively analyzed across 13 key properties, and its  potential applications  are outlined. Beyond the review, we also discuss domain-specific challenges and common data limitations to facilitate a critical view on data quality. To aid in data selection, we conduct a dataset popularity analysis in contemporary state-of-the-art NIDS research. Furthermore, the paper presents best practices for dataset selection, generation, and usage. By providing a comprehensive overview of the domain and its data, this work aims to guide future research toward  improving data quality  and the robustness of NIDS solutions.}

To mitigate the risks, existing methods based on personalized  differential privacy  add different noises to the query results of each data visitor. However, these methods require additional computation to assign a constant privacy budget for each visitor, leading to low sharing efficiency and data utility. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a visitor-attribute-based adaptive  differential privacy  (VADP) data-sharing scheme. The scheme first constructs a quantifiable hierarchical access structure to control visitors’ access to data attributes precisely, and adaptively determines the privacy level for each data attribute by quantifying the matching degree between the visitor attributes and the access structure. To enhance sharing efficiency, the scheme devises a lightweight privacy budget calculation matrix to compute privacy budgets efficiently, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, integrating the  VIKOR  method enables the scheme to balance data privacy and utility flexibly. Experiments show that regarding the data utility, the VADP scheme reduces the average query error by 39.4% compared with non-adaptive differential privacy methods. It also decreases computational overhead in the data-sharing phase by 40.3% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving  reachability  query can determine whether one vertex is reachable from another vertex, which is applied in many domains. Due to the growing size of graphs, more and more users upload blinded graphs to the cloud, which can reduce the computation and storage burden for users. While privacy-preserving  reachability  query schemes have been proposed, they do not consider the keyword information in vertices. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-keyword top- k <math><mi is="true">k</mi></math>  reachability query scheme (PM k <math><mi is="true">k</mi></math> R), which can find  k <math><mi is="true">k</mi></math>  vertices nearest to the source vertex, and containing the given keywords. In order to achieve the multi-keyword reachability query, we build the secure indexes based on the 2-hop labeling and the  balanced binary tree . The 2-hop labeling index can help quickly determine whether two vertices are reachable and the distance between them. We convert the inclusion relationship between vertices and keywords into vectors, and store in the tree index. We use the secure  Euclidean distance  calculation to protect data privacy, which can judge whether the vertices contain the query keywords by secure inner product computation. To avoid the cloud learning the correspondence between vertices in the tree index and 2-hop index, we perform two-layer blinding on the vertices. The security analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our scheme is secure and efficient.}

	abstract = {Large networks provide tremendous support for the deployment of networked services with fast response times by deploying a large number of servers and high-speed routers. While several techniques exist to detect network attacks, predicting future attacks can help to enhance the security of the network. Reflection attacks are known to be one of the most common causes of  service disruption  in large networks. A reflection attack is a special type of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack that hides the identity of the attacker and floods the network with a large volume of malicious traffic by using reflectors. Modern networks generate a large volume of NetFlow data, and analyzing this data is an advocated basis for identifying reflection attacks. A comprehensive analysis of 3.1 billion NetFlow records obtained from a large enterprise network is conducted, and reflection attacks on the  Domain Name Service  (DNS) and NetBIOS servers are identified in the NetFlow data. As far as it is known, there is no work that evaluated Temporal Convolution Network (TCN),  Recurrent Neural Network  (RNN) and  Long Short Term Memory  (LSTM)  deep learning  (DL) models to predict reflection attacks in a large network. Thus, the aim of this paper is to determine if TCN, RNN and LSTM can predict reflection attacks using NetFlow data. This paper proposes an approach to predict reflection attacks and evaluates TCN, RNN and LSTM on real NetFlow data. The results from this study show that: (a) RNN and LSTM predicted DNS server reflection attacks with the highest coefficient-of-determination ( R 2 <math><msup is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">R</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">2</mn></mrow></msup></math> ) value that ranged from 0.39 to 0.992 on different dates, (b) RNN, LSTM and TCN predicted NetBIOS server reflection attacks with the highest value of  R 2 <math><msup is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">R</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">2</mn></mrow></msup></math>  that ranged from 0.749 to 0.999 on different dates, (c) the percentage of packets generated by DNS server reflection attacks ranged from 0.001% to 18%, (d) the percentage of packets generated by NetBIOS server reflection attacks ranged from 0.2% to 16%, (e) the percentage of source and destination devices associated with DNS server reflection attacks ranged from 0.0006% to 0.022% and (f) the percentage of source and destination devices associated with NetBIOS server reflection attacks ranged from 0.071% to 34%. The outcomes are: (a) RNN and LSTM predicted DNS server reflection attacks with high accuracy on 12 dates, (b) RNN, LSTM and TCN predicted NetBIOS server reflection attacks with high accuracy on 14 dates, (c) RNN, LSTM and TCN predicted DNS server reflection attacks with low accuracy on 2 dates, (d) the traffic generated by DNS and NetBIOS servers reflection attacks did not overwhelm the network, and (e) a small number of source and destination devices are associated with these reflection attacks.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of encryption protocols has increased the complexity of detecting malicious  Android  traffic. By randomizing payload content, encryption obscures semantically explicit features in network traffic, thereby concealing its behavioral intent. Although existing methods mitigate this issue by expanding feature sets or extracting spatiotemporal patterns, they do not fundamentally reconstruct the original payload semantics. In this paper, we propose RATD, a detection model that enhances encrypted traffic representation by introducing semantics of source-APIs. This approach leverages the correlation between system API calls made prior to traffic transmission (referred to as source APIs) and the behavioral intent within encrypted traffic, thereby compensating for semantic loss. First, we construct API-traffic association samples by monitoring network connection APIs. Then, we transform the API sequences into graphs and apply a  Graph Convolutional Network  (GCN) to learn their structural and  semantic representations . These features are fused with corresponding traffic features through a multi-source encoder module. Finally, to address the challenges of limited data availability in real-world deployment, we introduce a representation  enhancement module  to improve model’s robustness in scenarios with missing data. Experimental results show that RATD is significantly better than the state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets. In particular, in scenarios with missing API data, the accuracy of our model decreases by at most 2.9%, showing a stronger environmental adaptability.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by  cyber attacks , such as  botnets . It is imperative to detect these attacks to prevent significant damage. However, existing solutions fail to meet both the efficacy and  interpretability  goals demanded in the real world. By analyzing the traffic patterns of normal  IoT  networks and attack traffic, we observe that (1)  IoT  devices with similar traffic patterns exhibit clustering tendencies; (2) the attack starts with one IoT device as a foothold, then moves to other devices, which proceeds in a progressive manner. Based on these insights, we propose DISTR, a novel framework that detects and validates  malicious activities  on an IoT device by analyzing behaviors of other devices within the same cluster in the network, which improves the detection accuracy. In addition, by causally correlating anomalies, DISTR is able to reconstruct the progression of IoT  botnets . Our evaluations on public datasets, along with those collected from real IoT devices, show that DISTR achieves the detection of IoT attacks accurately, on average with a precision and F1 score of 99.1% and 99.3%, respectively on various attack scenarios, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Employees are both the first line of defense in organizations and a significant source of vulnerability. Behavioral research in information security (InfoSec) has predominantly studied the compliance of employees with organizational directives. Less understood are ‘shadow security practices’ – a related category of behavior where employees adopt InfoSec workarounds, albeit to still comply with organizational security needs. We develop a model of the antecedents of employees’ intentions to engage in shadow security practices and empirically test our model through a sample of 433 office workers. Results of our  structural equation modeling  analysis reveal that both  InfoSec overload  and  psychological empowerment  increase intentions to adopt shadow security measures, whereas  perceived transparency of organizational InfoSec  (through InfoSec communication) reduces this intention. Furthermore, we find that these constructs are interrelated and that  InfoSec overload  can be increased by both  psychological empowerment  and  InfoSec transparency . Our study develops the theoretical understanding of the important yet under-researched concept of shadow security and presents practical recommendations to effectively manage organizational InfoSec through these factors.}
