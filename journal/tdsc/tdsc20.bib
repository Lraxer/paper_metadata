	abstract = {Encryption has become an indispensable technology for preserving confidentiality. Unfortunately, cybercriminals have re-purposed this technology to deny users access to their data. This trend has sparked an onslaught of ransomware attacks, that resulted in several victims being extorted to pay ransoms in return for restoring their maliciously encrypted data. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel runtime solution that seamlessly defends against cryptographic ransomware. A key observation made by this work is that maliciously encrypted data is initially buffered in the OS's page cache before it is flushed to the underlying storage device. Based on this observation, we develop a solution that efficiently manages data synchronization between the memory and storage subsystems to prevent maliciously encrypted data from being permanently committed to the underlying storage. We extensively validate the robustness of this approach against more than one thousand ransomware samples and show that our design reliably restores all encrypted files. Furthermore, our solution is resilient to ransomware that employ techniques including master boot record infection and multi-threaded attacks. Finally, an evaluation of our proof-of-concept implementation shows minimal performance impact while running a mix of compute and I/O bound applications.}

	abstract = {A key factor in big data analytics and artificial intelligence is the collection of user data from a large population. However, the collection of user data comes at the price of privacy risks, not only for users but also for businesses who are vulnerable to internal and external data breaches. To address privacy issues, local differential privacy (LDP) has been proposed to enable an untrusted collector to obtain accurate statistical estimation on sensitive user data (e.g., location, health, and financial data) without actually accessing the true records. As key-value data is an extremely popular NoSQL data model, there are a few works in the literature that study LDP-based statistical estimation on key-value data. However, these works have some major limitations, including supporting small key space only, fixed key collection range, difficulty in choosing an appropriate padding length, and high communication cost. In this article, we propose a two-phase mechanism PrivKVM^* as an optimized and highly-complete solution to LDP-based key-value data collection and statistics estimation. We verify its correctness and effectiveness through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results.}

	abstract = {In privacy-preserving cross-device federated learning, users train a global model on their local data and submit encrypted local models, while an untrusted central server aggregates the encrypted models to obtain an updated global model. Prior work has demonstrated how to verify the correctness of aggregation in such a setting. However, such verification relies on strong assumptions, such as a trusted setup among all users under unreliable network conditions, or it suffers from expensive cryptographic operations, such as bilinear pairing. In this paper, we scrutinize the verification mechanism of prior work and propose a model recovery attack, demonstrating that most local models can be leaked within a reasonable time (e.g., 98% of encrypted local models are recovered within 21 h). Then, we propose VerSA , a verifiable secure aggregation protocol for cross-device federated learning. VerSA does not require any trusted setup for verification between users while minimizing the verification cost by enabling both the central server and users to utilize only a lightweight pseudorandom generator to prove and verify the correctness of model aggregation. We experimentally confirm the efficiency of VerSA under diverse datasets, demonstrating that VerSA is orders of magnitude faster than verification in prior work.}

	abstract = {To reduce the cost of human and material resources and improve the collaborations among medical systems, research laboratories and insurance companies for healthcare researches and commercial activities, electronic medical records (EMRs) have been proposed to shift from paperwork to friendly shareable electronic records. To take advantage of EMRs efficiently and reduce the cost of local storage, EMRs are usually outsourced to the remote cloud for sharing medical data with authorized users. However, cloud service providers are untrustworthy. In this paper, we propose an efficient, secure, and flexible EMR sharing system by introducing a novel cryptosystem called dual-policy revocable attribute-based encryption and tamper resistance blockchain technology. Our proposed system enables EMRs to be shared at a fine-grained level and allows data users to detect any unauthorized manipulation. Moreover, the key generation center can revoke malicious users without affecting the honest users. We provide the formal security model as well as the concrete scheme with security analysis. The experimental simulation and experimental analysis of our proposed scheme demonstrate that our proposed system has superior performances to the most relevant solutions.}

	abstract = {With the increasing scale of parallel computer interconnection network, the possibility of processor failure or link failure between processors in the network is also increasing. In the design of supercomputers, not only link overhead and communication delay should be taken into account, but also fault-tolerant performance of networks should be emphasized. Locally exchanged twisted cube (\nLeTQ\n) is a newly proposed interconnection network with lower link overhead and shorter diameter. With the increasing scale of supercomputers, fault-tolerant routing is indispensable. In this article, we propose a new load balancing fault-tolerant routing algorithm based on node contraction for\nLeTQ\nnetworks. The proposed algorithm uses the node shrinkage method to evaluate the priority of nodes. The sending node adaptively adjusts the probability of forwarding packets to the neighbor node according to the priority of the neighbor node and the state of the network. The path can be adapted to the load state of the network. The simulation results show that the fault-tolerant routing algorithm has good performance in throughput and delay.}

	abstract = {We investigate the transferability of adversarial attacks against deep neural networks (DNNs)—the contagion effect of adversarial attacks that, once deceiving one DNN model, can easily deceive other DNN models built on similar data. We demonstrate that introducing randomness to DNN models can break the curse of the transferability of adversarial attacks, given that the adversary does not have an unlimited attack budget. Two randomization schemes are explored: 1.) a random selection—single or ensemble—from a set of DNNs is surprisingly more robust against the strongest form of complete-knowledge attacks (a.k.a, white box attacks); 2.) after a small Gaussian random noise is added to its learned weights, a DNN model can potentially increase its resilience to adversarial attacks by as much as 74.2%. We compare the two randomization techniques to the Ensemble Adversarial Training technique and show that our randomization techniques are superior under different attack budget constraints. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between attack severity and decision boundary robustness in the version space. Finally, we connect the dots between the effectiveness of randomization to prevent attack transferability and the variability of DNN models through analyzing the differential entropy of sample hypotheses in the hypothesis space.}

However, the existing methods cannot solve the parametric problem caused by dynamic relations of multiple workflow processes or recommend an optimal collaboration plan because of erroneous information. In this article, we propose a new approach to recommend security-aware collaboration plans for multiple workflow processes with dynamic relations. First, we develop three basic computing patterns of dynamic relations and construct a parametric sprouting graph for multiple workflow processes with dynamic relations. Second, we present the procedure of recommending an optimal secure collaboration plan that satisfy security requirements. By comparison with the existing methods via two experiments, our approach not only can solve the parametric problem caused by dynamic relations of multiple workflow processes, but also can recommend an optimal secure collaboration plan under security requirements.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of multi-user dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DMUSSE) where a data owner stores its encrypted documents on an untrusted remote server and wishes to selectively allow multiple users to access them by issuing keyword search queries. Specifically, we consider the case where some of the users may be corrupted and colluding with the server to extract additional information about the dataset (beyond what they have access to). We provide the first formal security definition for the dynamic setting as well as forward and backward privacy definitions. We then propose\nμ\nSE , the first provably secure DMUSSE scheme and instantiate it in two versions, one based on oblivious data structures and one based on update queues, with different performance trade-offs. Furthermore, we extend\nμ\nSE to support verifiability of results. To achieve this, users need a secure digest initially computed by the data owner and changed after every update. We efficiently accommodate this, without relying on a trusted third party, by adopting a blockchain-based approach for the digests’ dissemination and deploy our schemes over the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. We prototype both versions and experimentally evaluate their practical performance, both as stand-alone systems and running on top of Hyperledger Fabric.}

Basic POL security requirements are unforgeability of\npol\n, and its non-transferability (a\npol\nissued to user\nu\n1\ncannot be used by\nu\n2\n). An additional important property of POL systems is user privacy against the issuers and verifiers. We make two contributions. First, we formalize the POL security and privacy properties, and construct the first system providing provable security and privacy against the issuer and the verifier, both. Second, we introduce a geo-tampering attack that completely breaks POL system security, by simply changing the location of a\npol\nissuing node. The attack applies to portable infrastructure nodes that are not continually monitored. We propose an algorithm that is used by a\npol\nissuer to provide a location integrity “proof”, that will be embedded in a\npol\nto protect against this attack. The proof relies on a novel application of euclidean Distance Matrices. We implemented our POL on an off-the-shelf Android smartphone to show the practicality of the proposed algorithms.}

In this article, we put forward the concept of category privacy for the first time to indicate which classes of data a client has , which is an important but ignored privacy goal in the federated learning with non-iid data. Although secure aggregation protocols are designed for federated learning to protect the input privacy of clients, we perform the first systematic study on category inference attack and demonstrate that these protocols cannot fully protect category privacy. We design a differential selection strategy and two de-noising approaches to achieve the attack goal successfully. In our evaluation, we apply the attack to non-iid federated learning settings with various datasets.

Skills can access personal information and this may pose a risk to users. However, there is little information about how this ecosystem works, let alone the tools that can facilitate its study. In this article, we present the largest systematic measurement of the Amazon Alexa skill ecosystem to date. We study developers’ practices in this ecosystem, including how they collect and justify the need for sensitive information, by designing a methodology to identify over-privileged skills with broken privacy policies. We collect 199,295 Alexa skills and uncover that around 43% of the skills (and 50% of the developers) that request these permissions follow bad privacy practices, including (partially) broken data permissions traceability. In order to perform this kind of analysis at scale, we present SkillVet that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and generates high-accuracy prediction sets. We report several concerning practices, including how developers can bypass Alexa's permission system through account linking and conversational skills, and offer recommendations on how to improve transparency, privacy and security. Resulting from the responsible disclosure we did, 13% of the reported issues no longer pose a threat at submission time.}

However, directly combing encryption and compression incurs substantial performance degradation. We propose TinyEnc, an encrypted data storage system for cloud-based key-value store, which supports encryption and compression simultaneously with rich query support. To reconcile encryption and compression without compromising performance, we first propose a new encrypted compression data structure to enable fine-grained access to compressed and encrypted key-value data. We then propose two new transforming mechanisms, namely orthogonal data dividing and hierarchical data padding, to transform a plaintext key-value table into the encrypted compression data structure in a privacy-preserving way. Finally, we craft order-revealing encryption (ORE) and symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) to design a new encrypted search index over the encrypted compression data structure to support rich types of data queries. We implement a prototype of TinyEnc on top of Cassandra. Besides, the evaluation result shows that TinyEnc increases the throughput by up to 7 times and compression ratio by up to 1.3 times with respect to previous works.}

	abstract = {Smart-card based password authentication has been the most widely used two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism for security-critical applications (e.g., e-Health, smart grid and e-Commerce) in the past decades, and it is likely to hold its status in the foreseeable future. Hundreds of this type of 2FA schemes have been proposed, yet to our knowledge, most of them are built on the intractability of conventional hard problems (e.g., discrete logarithm problems and integer factoring problems) which are no longer hard in the quantum era. With the recent advancements in quantum computing, the design of secure and efficient smart-card based password authentication schemes against quantum attacks is becoming increasingly urgent. However, it is not as simple as it seems, how to design such a quantum-resistant 2FA scheme is challenging due to the demanding security requirements and the resource-constrained nature of mobile devices . In this work, we take the first step towards this issue by proposing Quantum2FA, a practical quantum-resistant smart-card-based password authentication scheme that employs Alkim et al. ’s lattice-based key exchange and Wang-Wang’s “fuzzy-verifier + honeywords” technique (IEEE TDSC’18). Particularly, Quantum2FA can thwart the newly revealed key-reuse attack (ACISP’18, CT-RSA’19) against lattice-based key exchange schemes in two aspects: signal leakage attacks and key mismatch attacks. Specifically, it restricts the necessary conditions (i.e., the attacker must be the initiator of the key exchange) for an adversary to analyze the signal; It introduces honeywords to detect the key mismatches between the smart card and the server, and thus smart card loss attack can be thwarted. We formally prove the security of Quantum2FA under the random oracle model and demonstrate its efficiency through experiments on a 32 MHz 8-bit AVR Embedded Processor. Comparison results show that Quantum2FA is not only more secure but also offers better computation efficiency than the state-of-the-art conventional 2FA schemes.}

	abstract = {Online Ride Hailing (ORH) services gain remarkable development in the past decade, which enable riders and drivers to establish optimized rides via mobile device. To guarantee user safety, ORH service providers often monitor the ride trajectory and report the abnormal behavior once a trajectory deviation occurs. Along with the advantage of safety monitoring raises some vital privacy concerns on user location information leakage. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving safety monitoring scheme for ORH services, called pSafety. It enables an ORH service provider to detect user’s trajectory deviation without learning anything about users’ locations. In pSafety, we propose two secure trajectory similarity computation algorithms by using somewhat homomorphic encryption, which are used to plan an agreed path and measure trajectory deviation, respectively. Furthermore, we also design a ciphertext compression algorithm and a secure comparison protocol to improve efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations show that pSafety is secure, accurate and efficient.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Digital Forensics (VDF) is essential to enable liability cognizance of accidents and fight against crimes. Ensuring the authority to timely gather, analyze, and trace data promotes vehicular investigations. However, adversaries crave the identity of the data provider/user, damage the evidence, violate evidence jurisdiction, and leak evidence. Therefore, protecting privacy and evidence accountability while guaranteeing access control and traceability in VDF is no easy task. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose Eunomia: an anonymous and secure VDF scheme based on blockchain. It preserves privacy with decentralized anonymous credentials without trusted third parties. Vehicular data and evidence are uploaded by data providers to the blockchain and stored in distributed data storage. Each investigation is modeled as a finite state machine with state transitions being executed by smart contracts. Eunomia achieves fine-grained evidence access control via ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption and Bulletproofs. A user must hold specific attributes and a temporary-and-unexpired token/warrant to retrieve data from the blockchain. Finally, a secret key is embedded into data to trace the traitor if any evidence breach happens. We use a formal analysis to demonstrate the strong privacy and security properties of Eunomia. Moreover, we build a prototype in a WiFi-based Ethereum test network to evaluate its performance.}

	abstract = {In cryptocurrencies, privacy of users is preserved using pseudonymity . However, it has been shown that pseudonymity does not result in anonymity if a user's transactions are linkable. This makes cryptocurrencies vulnerable to deanonymization attacks. The current solutions proposed in the literature suffer from at least one of the following issues: (1) requiring a trusted third–party entity, (2) poor performance, and (3) incompatible with the standard structure of cryptocurrencies. In this article, we propose Unlinkable Coin (UCoin), a secure mix–based approach to address these issues. In UCoin, the link between the input (payer) and output (payee) addresses in a transaction is broken. This is done by mixing the transactions of multiple users into a single aggregated transaction in which the output addresses have been secretly shuffled. In our protocol design, we first develop HDC–net, a secure shuffling protocol that enables a group of users to anonymously publish their data. Then, we deploy the proposed HDC–net protocol in the UCoin architecture (as a mixing unit) to generate the aggregate transactions. We show that UCoin (1) does not rely on a trusted third–party, (2) can mix 50 transactions in 6.3 seconds that is 18% faster than the current solutions, and (3) is fully compatible with the architecture of cryptocurrencies.}

	abstract = {Data center downtime typically centers around IT equipment failure. Storage devices are the most frequently failing components in data centers. We present a comparative study of hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) that constitute the typical storage in data centers. Using six-year field data of 100,000 HDDs of different models from the same manufacturer from the Backblaze dataset and six-year field data of 30,000 SSDs of three models from a Google data center, we characterize the workload conditions that lead to failures. We illustrate that their root failure causes differ from common expectations and that they remain difficult to discern. For the case of HDDs we observe that young and old drives do not present many differences in their failures. Instead, failures may be distinguished by discriminating drives based on the time spent for head positioning. For SSDs, we observe high levels of infant mortality and characterize the differences between infant and non-infant failures. We develop several machine learning failure prediction models that are shown to be surprisingly accurate, achieving high recall and low false positive rates. These models are used beyond simple prediction as they aid us to untangle the complex interaction of workload characteristics that lead to failures and identify failure root causes from monitored symptoms.}

	abstract = {Low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attacks exploit the security vulnerabilities of network protocols adaptive mechanisms to launch periodic bursts. These attacks result in the severe destruction of the quality of service of TCP applications. Therefore, detection of LDoS attacks is a concern among scientific communities. However, the existing coarse-scale detection methods yield poor detection performance and adaptability. To achieve the accurate detection of LDoS attacks, an adaptive Kohonen Network based fine-grained detection (AKN-FGD) model for LDoS attacks is proposed. Based on the burst and periodicity characteristics of attack traffic, the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm is used to estimate the pulse period, which is the length of the detection unit. Subsequently, cluster analysis is performed for each detection unit using the adaptive Kohonen network (AKN) algorithm because the discreteness of traffic suffering from LDoS attacks is more pronounced than that of legitimate traffic. Finally, the existence of LDoS attacks can be verified in view of a novel decision metric, denoted as the anomaly degree, based on the clustering results. We conducted experiments not solely in traditional networks using NS3 and in a test-bed environment but also in a software-defined network (SDN), with accuracies of 99.7%, 99.8%, and 95.6% for detecting LDoS bursts, respectively. The experimental results show that the AKN-FGD scheme not only enables accurate fine-grained detection, that is, it can detect every attack burst, but also estimates the start and end times of the attacks. Moreover, we have compared the AKN-FGD scheme with some other detection methods, and a comparison of the results show that our proposed approach displays better detection performance.}

	abstract = {In smart farming sector, Internet of Things (IoT) based smart sensing systems are vulnerable to failure, malfunction, and malicious attacks. Also, sensors are deployed often in an alien and harsh environment. Here, the conditions are not well supportive which either causes the sensor to fail prematurely or gives unusual and erroneous readings, known as outliers. This effects the smart network's performance and decision-making ability in many ways. Therefore, it is important to accurately detect the IoT sensor behaviour in legitimate, faulty, and compromised or attack scenarios. To distinguish the sensor behaviour in different scenarios we have proposed a feasible approach using spatial correlation theory which is validated using Moran's I index tool. We have used Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to test our approach. For real-time anomaly detection we have used an edge computing technology. We have compared the proposed approach, using Forest Fire real dataset, with the three existing recent works. Our results are promising in terms of accurate detection of IoT sensor behaviours in real-time. This will assist the precision farming industry in making better decisions to securely manage IoT field network, increase productivity, and improves operational efficiency.}

	abstract = {Most existing image privacy protection works focus mainly on the privacy of photo owners and their friends, but lack the consideration of other people who are in the background of the photos and the related location privacy issues. In fact, when a person is in the background of someone else’s photos, he/she may be unintentionally exposed to the public when the photo owner shares the photo online. Not only a single visited place could be exposed, attackers may also be able to piece together a person’s travel route from images. In this article, we propose a novel image privacy protection system, called LAMP, which aims to light up the location awareness for people during online image sharing. The LAMP system is based on a newly designed location-aware multi-party image access control model. Unlike previous works on small scales, the LAMP system is highly efficient and scalable as it can enforce privacy protection for billions of users on social networks in real time. The LAMP system automatically detects the user’s occurrences on photos regardless the user is the photo owner or not. Once a user is identified and the location of the photo is deemed sensitive according to the user’s privacy policy, the user’s face will be replaced with a synthetic face. A prototype of the system was implemented and evaluated to demonstrate its applicability in the real world.}

Our method enables the production of audio streams in a frequency band of 0-24 kHz and playing audio files (e.g., WAV) from a computer power supply without the need for audio hardware or speakers. Furthermore, we developed techniques that exploit the multiple CPU cores and their corresponding switching frequencies. It enables the production of multi-channel soundtracks and controlling the bit-depth and volume of sound played through the power supply. Sensitive information (documents, biometric data, encryption keys, etc.) can be covertly transmitted to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone). We show that our technique works with various types of systems: PC workstations and servers, as well as embedded systems and IoT devices that have no audio hardware at all. We also show that the attack can operate from an ordinary user mode process, run on virtual machines monitors (VMMs), and doesn’t need special privileges.}

DL based steganography distributes secret information over all the available bits of the cover image, thereby posing difficulties in using conventional steganalysis methods to detect, extract or remove hidden secret images. However, our proposed framework is the first to effectively disable covert communications and transactions that use DL based steganography. We propose a DL based steganalysis technique that effectively removes secret images by restoring the distribution of the original images. We formulate a problem and address it by exploiting sophisticated pixel distributions and an edge distribution of images by using a deep neural network. Based on the given information, we remove the hidden secret information at the pixel level. We evaluate our technique by comparing it with conventional steganalysis methods using three public benchmarks. As the decoding method of DL based steganography is approximate (lossy) and is different from the decoding method of conventional steganography, we also introduce a new quantitative metric called the destruction rate (DT). The experimental results demonstrate performance improvements of 10–20\n%\nin both the decoded rate and the DT.}

As one of the most significant causes leading to false negatives, data-only patches become a fundamental problem that affects all state-of-the-art binary diffing approaches/tools. To this end, we first systematically study data-only patches, and thoroughly illustrate the essence and adverse effect on existing tools. Based on the observations, we further propose and implement a system named EnBinDiff based on Value Set Analysis (VSA) to effectively identify data-only patches. Specifically, EnBinDiff first precisely identifies functions from binaries, and then efficiently locates all “matched” function pairs based on structural binary diffing. After that, EnBinDiff performs data-only patch analysis , including stack frame matching and constant value matching, to identify data-only patches from the matched functions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EnBinDiff , we conduct an extensive evaluation with multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art binary diffing tools, and the false negative rate is reduced from 11.02% to 1.63%. Furthermore, we apply EnBinDiff to analyze real-world binaries, and successfully identify 20 1-day vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Blockchain systems face two emergent problems, namely scalability and privacy, each of which has been addressed independently. However, how to achieve privacy and scalability simultaneously remains a challenging problem for blockchains. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and scalable permissioned blockchain system called HyperMaze employing the zero knowledge proof technique and a hierarchical system architecture. It gains scalability by adopting a hierarchy of multiple blockchains that processes transactions in parallel. We design an ID-based dual-balance account model where an identity-based account is associated with two types of balances–a plaintext balance and a private (zero-knowledge) balance. Furthermore, we design a two-phase cross-chain transaction mechanism (2PXT) to achieve transaction privacy for both intra-chain and cross-chain transactions. We rigorously formulate a security model for HyperMaze under the universal composability framework, and then provide a simulation-based security proof. A prototype of HyperMaze is implemented and a series of experiments are conducted over up to 2,600 nodes to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that a 4-level, (7,10)-threshold, 6-ary HyperMaze system can reach 19,440 TPS and the transaction confirmation latency is only 9.5 seconds. To our best knowledge, HyperMaze is the first high-throughput privacy-preserving blockchain whose throughput is over 19,000 TPS.}

This architecture has two key advantages: i) its functional correctness and security are guaranteed by a machine-checkable proof of security objectives of Trusted Application (TA) isolation, runtime confidentiality, and runtime integrity, and ii) it is applicable to different TEE platforms and implementation-independent due to its high level of abstraction and non-determinism of data types. Note that access control policy and information flow control policy are the core for security management of resources. After formally specifying the security attributes of TEE resources, we develop these policies based on Common Criteria (CC) in the security monitor and provide atomic interfaces. CVTEE is formally verified with 386 lemmas/theorems and\n∼\n10,000 LOC of Isabelle/HOL. In addition, we implement a proof of concept for the access control module of Teaclave, and prove that the constructed access control model meets the security requirements through 5 theorems.}

However, due to the entanglements of real-world software stacks, accomplishing this task can be surprisingly challenging as we take accuracy, reliability, and transparency into the equation. In this article, we identify six challenges that API monitoring solutions should overcome in order to manage these dimensions effectively and outline actionable design points for building robust API tracers that can be used even for security research. We then detail and evaluate SNIPER, an open-source API tracing system available in two variants based on dynamic binary instrumentation (for simplified in-guest deployment) and hardware-assisted virtualization (realizing the first general user-space tracer of this kind), respectively.}

	abstract = {Payment channel, which allows two parties to perform micropayments without involving the blockchain, has become a promising proposal to improve the scalability of decentralized ledgers. Payment channels have been extended to payment networks to utilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others. However, payments through multiple channels bear nontrivial overheads, including time cost, charges at intermediate nodes, etc. In this paper, we propose channel hub, a novel off-chain system to shorten the routing path for the payment network. Channel hub allows transferring coins directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub, so that it can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment network. Compared with payment hub in literature, which connects participant nodes, our channel hub is more efficient and lightweight, because it connects channels already constructed by the payment network. Based on channel hub, we design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers. We present the security definition of Boros and formally prove its security using the UC-framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of Boros, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype running on Ethereum. Performance evaluation shows that Boros can effectively shorten the off-chain payment path.}

	abstract = {Recently, the fog computing concept has been introduced into vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to formulate fog-based VANETs. Since the communication channels between vehicles and fog nodes are open and insecure, it is necessary to construct an authenticated key agreement (AKA) scheme for securing the channels. The existing AKA schemes have two main deficiencies. One is that the computational and communication overhead are not low enough to satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive applications. The other is that the multi-trusted-authority (multi-TA) model has not been considered. To solve the deficiencies, we propose a lightweight and conditional privacy-preserving AKA scheme, where the main steps are designed with symmetric cryptography methods. The design can reduce the computational and communication overhead of the AKA process. Additionally, we consider the multi-TA model in the AKA process to solve the single-point-of-failure issue. By integrating Cuckoo filter into the multi-TA model, the secrecy of real identities of legal vehicles is guaranteed and the identity revocation function for illegal vehicles is supported in the AKA process. The security proof and analysis show that our proposed scheme satisfies the essential security and privacy requirements of VANETs. The performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme outperforms other related and represented schemes.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) provides a high efficient decentralized machine learning framework, where the training data remains distributed at remote clients in a network. Though FL enables a privacy-preserving mobile edge computing framework using IoT devices, recent studies have shown that this approach is susceptible to poisoning attacks from the side of remote clients. To address the poisoning attacks on FL, we provide a two-phase defense algorithm called\nLo\n–\n–\n–\ncal \nMa\n–\n–\n–\n–\nlicious Facto\nr\n–\n(LoMar). In phase I, LoMar scores model updates from each remote client by measuring the relative distribution over their neighbors using a kernel density estimation method. In phase II, an optimal threshold is approximated to distinguish malicious and clean updates from a statistical perspective. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets have been conducted, and the experimental results show that our defense strategy can effectively protect the FL system. Specifically, the defense performance on Amazon dataset under a label-flipping attack indicates that, compared with FG+Krum, LoMar increases the target label testing accuracy from\n96.0%\nto\n98.8%\n, and the overall averaged testing accuracy from\n90.1%\nto\n97.0%\n.}

	abstract = {Insider threats are one of the most difficult problems to solve, given the privileges and information available to insiders to launch different types of attacks. Current security systems can record and analyze sequences from a deluge of log data, potentially becoming a tool to detect insider threats. The issue is that insiders mix the sequence of attack steps with valid actions, reducing the capacity of security systems to programmatically detect the attacks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce LADOHD, an anomaly detection framework based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, which learns the expected event patterns in a computer system to identify attack sequences even when attacks span for a long time. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on a dataset of 38.9 million events collected from a commercial network of 30 computers over twenty days and where a 4-day long insider threat attack occurs. Results show that LADOHD outperforms the anomaly detection system used to protect the commercial network with a True Positive Rate of 97.29% and a False Positive Rate of 0.38%. Experiments also show that LSTMs have higher prediction precision in variable-length sequences than methods like Hidden Markov Models, a crucial requirement in sequence-analysis-based anomaly detection techniques.}

	abstract = {Perceptual image hashing is an effective and efficient way to identify images in large-scale databases, where two major performances are robustness and discrimination. A better tradeoff between robustness and discrimination is still a severe challenge for the current hashing research. Aiming at this issue, we design a novel perceptual image Hashing with Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) (hereafter HLPP). Specifically, to improve the robustness against content-preserving operations, Gabor filtering is leveraged to adaptively extract the orientation and structure features, which are consistent with the response of human visual system. The LPP is adopted to learn intrinsic local structure from the maximum Gabor filtering response. The use of LPP can discover meaningful low-dimensional information hidden in the maximum Gabor filtering response and thus improves discrimination of HLPP. During hash similarity calculation, the Hamming distance is selected as the metric. The tradeoff performance between robustness and discrimination is validated on benchmark databases, and the results indicate that the proposed HLPP is superior to some state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, extensive experiments of copy detection also demonstrate that the proposed HLPP can provide higher accuracy than the compared algorithms.}

	abstract = {Private key (e.g., RSA key) protection is a significant issue for cloud but existing keyless or keyguard solutions suffer from performance, elasticity or applicability limitations. Recently, represented by Intel KPT, a novel keyguard architecture emerges to combine trusted platform module and crypto accelerator for achieving both security and performance. However, the straight use of KPT for private key protection may not be a good fit in cloud as it incurs challenges on protection capacity, key provisioning latency and transparency. Based on KPT-like hardware, we propose QKPT, a comprehensive key management system to bring your own private keys (BYOPK) into multi-tenant clouds. QKPT introduces a carefully-designed key wrapping layer to overcome these challenges. A small symmetric wrapping key (SWK) is generated for each tenant as the master key to resolve the former two challenges, while a special private key wrapping scheme is adopted to resolve the transparency limitation. Additionally, QKPT incorporates certificate trust to enhance the security of the SWK lifecycle and provides a hardened key server solution without expensive HSM. The evaluation shows that QKPT has a low runtime overhead (\n≤\n1.2% for SSL/TLS handshakes) and still greatly outperforms the software baseline (3.5x-17x) owing to the crypto offloading.}

Typical requirements of group communications include secrecy, authentication, sender non-repudiation, and sender privacy. However, conventional approaches such as group key agreement and broadcast encryption are generally not designed to achieve all these requirements simultaneously or efficiently. In this article, we propose a one-round dynamic authenticated asymmetric group key agreement with sender non-repudiation and privacy (DAAGKAwSNP) protocol. A key building block of our DAAGKAwSNP protocol is our proposed batch multi-signature scheme with strong unforgeability. We prove that the DAAGKAwSNP protocol achieves secrecy under chosen ciphertext attacks – CCA, assuming the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman and k-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent problem. We also evaluate DAAGKAwSNP’s performance to demonstrate its utility.}

The lack of benchmark data in the field, forced researchers to employ various resources that often did not reflect real programming practices. Throughout the years, research studies have used textbook examples, students’ programming assignments, faculty code samples, code from programming competitions and files retrieved from open-source repositories as research objects. The diversity of the data raised concerns about the feasibility of capturing the appropriate data characteristics to reliably evaluate code attribution. In this paper, we investigate these concerns and analyze the effect of the dataset characteristics and feature elimination techniques on the accuracy of code attribution. Unlike the majority of the work done in this field, which mainly concentrates on designing new features, we explore the nature of the data used in previous studies and assess the factors that influence the attribution task. Within this analysis, we investigate the robustness of three feature sets regarded as reliable benchmarks in the attribution research. Based on our findings, we define a process for deriving a reduced set of features for accurate and predictable attribution and make recommendations on the dataset characteristics.}

To address this challenge, we developed Liveries , a technique that enables lightweight, verifiable in-enclave user isolation for protecting time-sharing services. Our approach restricts an in-enclave thread's privilege when configuring an enclave, and further performs integrity check and sanitization on critical enclave data upon user switches. For this purpose, we developed a novel technique that ensures the protection of sensitive user data (e.g., session keys) even in the presence of the adversary who may have compromised the enclave. Our study shows that the new technique is lightweight (1% overhead) and verifiable (about 3200 lines of code), making a step towards assured protection of real-world in-enclave services.}

Whereas MPC protocols for specific computations have existed since the 1980s, only recently general-purpose compilers have been developed to allow MPC on arbitrary functions. Yet, using today's MPC compilers requires substantial programming effort and skill on the user's side, among other things because nearly all compilers translate the code of the computation into a Boolean or arithmetic circuit. In particular, the circuit representation requires unrolling loops and recursive calls, which forces programmers to (often manually) define loop bounds and hardly use recursion. We present an approach allowing MPC on an arbitrary computation expressed as ordinary code with all functionalities that does not need to be translated into a circuit. Our notion of input and output privacy is predicated on unlinkability. Our method leverages co-utile computation outsourcing using anonymous channels via decentralized reputation, makes a minimalistic use of cryptography and does not require participants to be honest-but-curious: it works as long as participants are rational (self-interested), which may include rationally malicious peers (who become attackers if this is advantageous to them). We present example applications, including e-voting. Our empirical work shows that reputation captures well the behavior of peers and ensures that parties with high reputation obtain correct results.}

In this work, we propose novel encoding methods to pack matrix in a compact way and more efficient methods to perform matrix multiplication on homomorphically encrypted data, leading to a speed boost of\n1.5×−20×\nfor slim rectangular matrix multiplication compared with state-of-the-art. Moreover, we integrate our optimized secure matrix arithmetic with the MPI distributed computing framework, achieving scalable parallel secure matrix computation. Equipped with the optimized matrix multiplication, we propose uSCORE , a privacy-preserving cross-domain recommendation system for the unbalanced scenario, where a big data owner provides recommendation as a service to a client who has less data and computation power. Our design delegates most of the computation to the service provider, and has a low communication cost, which previous works failed to achieve. For a client who has 16 million user-item pairs to update, it only needs about 3 minutes (in the LAN setting) to prepare the encrypted data. The server can finish the update process on the encrypted data in less than half an hour, effectively reducing the client's test error from 0.72 to 0.62.}

	abstract = {Image classifiers for recognizing real-world objects are widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems(CPSs). A classifier is trained offline by machine learning algorithms with training data sets, and then it is deployed on a cloud or an edge computing system for online label predictions. As the classifier's performance depends on the underlying software infrastructure, it may degrade over time due to software faults causing software aging. In this paper, we address this issue and experimentally investigate software aging observed in an image classification system that continuously runs on cloud and edge computing environments. We apply several statistical techniques to analyze degradation trends in the systems under stress tests. Our statistical trend analysis confirms the degradation trends in the throughput as well as the available memory resources both in the cloud and the edge environments. Contrary to our expectation, the edge computing environment under test had much less impact on the performance degradation than our cloud environment when the workload is high, although the latter one has four times larger allocated memory resources. We also show that the observed performance degradation trends are associated with the memory usage of specific processes by performing correlation analysis.}

	abstract = {Processors nowadays are consistently equipped with debugging features to facilitate program analysis. Specifically, the ARM debugging architecture involves a series of CoreSight components and debug registers to aid the system debugging, and a group of debug authentication signals are designed to restrict the usage of these components and registers. Meanwhile, the security of the debugging features is under-examined since it normally requires physical access to use these features in the traditional debugging model. However, ARM introduces a new debugging model that requires no physical access since ARMv7, which exacerbates our concern on the security of the debugging features. In this article, we perform a comprehensive security analysis of the ARM debugging features and summarize the security implications. To understand the impact of the implications, we also investigate a series of platforms with ARM-A architecture in different product domains (i.e., development boards, IoT devices, cloud servers, and mobile devices). We consider that the analysis and investigation expose a new attacking surface that universally exists in platforms with ARM-A architecture. To verify our concern, we further craft Nailgun attack, which obtains sensitive information (e.g., AES encryption key and fingerprint image) and achieves arbitrary payload execution in a high-privilege mode from a low-privilege mode via misusing the debugging features. This attack does not rely on software bugs, and our experiments show that almost all the platforms we investigated are vulnerable to the attack. Our analysis also indicates that ARM-R and ARM-M platforms may suffer from the same issue. To defend against the attack, we discuss potential mitigations from different perspectives in the ARM ecosystem. Finally, a practical defense mechanism based on ARM virtualization technology is presented, and the evaluation result shows that our defense can prevent Nailgun with a negligible performance penalty.}

	abstract = {Web applications are exposed to many threats and, despite the best defensive efforts, are often successfully attacked. Reverting the effects of an attack on the state of such an application requires a profound knowledge about the application, to understand what data did the attack corrupt. Furthermore, it requires knowing what steps are needed to revert the effects without modifying legitimate data created by legitimate users. Existing intrusion recovery systems are capable of reverting the effects of the attack but they require modifications to the source code of the application, which may be unpractical. We present Sanare , a pluggable intrusion recovery system designed for web applications that use different data storage systems to keep their state. Sanare does not require any modification to the source code of the application or the web server. Instead, it uses a new deep learning scheme that we also introduce in the article, Matchare , that learns the matches between the HTTP requests and the database statements, file system operations, and web service requests that the HTTP requests caused. We evaluated Sanare with three open source web applications: WordPress, GitLab and ownCloud. In our experiments, Matchare achieved precision and recall higher than 97.5% with a performance overhead of less than 18% to the application.}

	abstract = {The steganography research of videos leads to excellent communication methods for transmitting secret message, and high efficiency video coding(HEVC) video is one popular steganographic carrier. This article proposes a prediction unit(PU) based wide residual-net steganography(PWRN) for HEVC videos. The visual quality distortion of modifying PUs is theoretically analyzed, which illustrates that modifying PUs only has a little negative effect on visual quality. Therefore, the data hiding method in this article allows to modify all types of PUs except for\n2N×2N\nto each other according to the secret data. In this way, high embedding efficiency is achieved, and the PU distributions in stego-videos can be kept similar to those of cover-videos, which is essential for resisting steganalysis. Meanwhile, a super-resolution convolutional neural network(CNN) with wide residual-net filter(WRNF) is proposed to replace the in-loop filter in HEVC for reconstructing I-pictures, which results in more precisely predicted P-pictures, and it further leads to less bitrate cost and better visual quality of stego-videos. The experimental results show that the proposed PWRN successfully resists the latest PU-targeted steganalysis algorithms, and compared with the state-of-the-art work, PWRN has achieved the lowest bitrate cost and the highest visual quality under the same capacity.}

	abstract = {Neural network (NN) inference services enrich many applications, like image classification, object recognition, facial verification, and more. These NN inference services are increasingly becoming an essential offering from cloud computing providers, where end-users’ data are offloaded to the cloud for inference under a customized model. However, current cloud-based inference services operate on clear inputs and NN models, raising paramount privacy concerns. Individual user data may contain private information that should always remain confidential. Meanwhile, the NN model is deemed proprietary to the model owner as model training requires substantial resources. In this article, we present, tailor, and evaluate Sonic , a lightweight secure NN inference service delegated in the cloud. Sonic leverages the cloud computing paradigm to fully outsource the secure inference, freeing end devices and model owners from being actively online for assistance. Sonic guards both user input and model privacy along the whole service flow. We design a series of secure and efficient NN layer functions purely using lightweight cryptographic primitives. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Sonic achieves up to\n60×\nbandwidth saving in online inference compared to prior art.}

This article designs a new wireless communication system to deal with eavesdropping attacks. The proposed system can enable a legitimate receiver to get desired messages and meanwhile an eavesdropper to hear “fake” but meaningful messages by combining confidentiality and deception, thereby confusing the eavesdropper and achieving additional concealment that further protects exchanged messages. Towards this goal, we propose techniques that can conceal exchanged messages by utilizing wireless channel characteristics between the transmitter and the receiver, as well as techniques that can attract an eavesdropper to gradually approach a trap region, where the eavesdropper can get fake messages. We also provide both theoretical and empirical analysis of the established secure channel between the transmitter and the receiver. We develop a prototype system using Universal Software Defined Radio Peripherals (USRPs). Experimental results show that an eavesdropper at a trap location can receive fake information with a bit error rate (BER) close to 0, and the transmitter with multiple antennas can successfully deploy a trap area.}

Prior works have explored automated exploit generation for vulnerable Ethereum contracts. However, the scopes of prior works are limited in both vulnerability types and contract platforms. In this paper, we propose a cross-platform framework, called ExGen , to generate multiple transactions as exploits to given vulnerable smart contracts. ExGen first translates either Ethereum or EOS contracts to an intermediate representation (IR). Then, ExGen generates symbolic attack contracts with transactions in a partial order and then symbolically executes the attack contracts together with the target to find and solve all the constraints. Lastly, ExGen concretizes all the symbols, generates attack contracts with multiple transactions, and verifies the generated contracts’ exploitability on a private chain with values crawled from the public chain. We implemented a prototype of ExGen and evaluated it on Ethereum and EOS benchmarks. ExGen successfully exploits 1,258/1,399 (89.9%) Ethereum and 126/130 (96.9%) EOS vulnerabilities. ExGen is also able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on EOS.}

	abstract = {Given the popularity of audio and video applications, compressed audio has become an important carrier of covert communication on the Internet. Many novel compressed audio steganography schemes have emerged that offer good hiding capability and aural concealment. In this paper, a universal steganalysis scheme called MultiSpecNet is proposed to detect steganography based on multiple embedding domains (advanced audio coding (AAC) and MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3)), which are currently the two most popular compressed audio standards. The basic idea is that modification of either domain by a steganography scheme will change the time-frequency relationship of the audio signal after decoding. The proposed approach adopts the spectrogram as the input feature to extract richer information. DeepResNet is used to learn the distinguishing feature representations, and multiscale spectrograms are used to enrich the feature diversity. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective at detecting different steganography schemes based on the AAC and MP3 embedding domains. The detection accuracy of the proposed scheme is higher than that achieved by other state-of-the-art schemes. Using spectrograms as the input, DeepResNet achieves better performance than schemes using quantized modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coefficients and mel-spectrogram, although the quantized MDCT coefficient is the parameter modified by the steganography schemes directly and mel-spectrogram is very popular and effective for general audio signal analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first audio steganalysis scheme that can detect multiple steganography schemes in both the MP3 and AAC embedding domains. The method proposed in this paper can be extended to audio steganalysis for other codecs or for audio forensics purposes.}

	abstract = {Data deduplication is a technique to eliminate duplicate data in order to save storage space and enlarge upload bandwidth, which has been applied by cloud storage systems. However, a cloud storage provider (CSP) may tamper user data or cheat users to pay unused storage for duplicate data that are only stored once. Although previous solutions adopt message-locked encryption along with Proof of Retrievability (PoR) to check the integrity of deduplicated encrypted data, they ignore proving the correctness of duplication check during data upload and require the same file to be derived into same verification tags, which suffers from brute-force attacks and restricts users from flexibly creating their own individual verification tags. In this paper, we propose a verifiable deduplication scheme called VeriDedup to address the above problems. It can guarantee the correctness of duplication check and support flexible tag generation for integrity check over encrypted data deduplication in an integrative way. Concretely, we propose a novel Tag-flexible Deduplication-supported Integrity Check Protocol (TDICP) based on Private Information Retrieval (PIR) by introducing a novel verification tag called\nnote set\n, which allows multiple users holding the same file to generate their individual verification tags and still supports tag deduplication at the CSP. Furthermore, we make the first attempt to guarantee the correctness of data duplication check by introducing a novel User Determined Duplication Check Protocol (UDDCP) based on Private Set Intersection (PSI), which can resist a CSP from providing a fake duplication check result to users. Security analysis shows the correctness and soundness of our scheme. Simulation studies based on real data show the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme and its significant advantages over prior arts.}

	abstract = {Decentralized storage (DS) projects such as Filecoin are gaining traction. Their openness mandates effective auditing mechanisms to assure users that their data remains intact. A blockchain is typically employed here as an unbiased public auditor. While the case for static data is relatively easy to handle, on-chain auditing of dynamic data with practical performance guarantees is still an open problem. Dynamic Proof-of-Storage (PoS) schemes developed for conventional cloud storage are not applicable to DS, since they require large storage proofs and/or large auditor states that are unmanageable by a resource-constrained blockchain. To fill the gap, we propose a family of dynamic on-chain auditing protocols that can produce concretely small auditor states while retaining the compact proofs promised by static PoS schemes. Our design revolves around a set of succinct data structures and optimization techniques for index information management. With proper instantiation and realistic parameters, our protocols can achieve 0.25MB on-chain state and 1.2KB storage proof for the auditing of 1TB data, outperforming previous dynamic PoS schemes that are adaptable for DS by orders of magnitude. As another practical contribution, we introduce a data abstraction layer that allows one to deploy the auditing protocols on arbitrary storage systems hosting dynamic data.}

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) enable Information Technology to be integrated with Operation Technology to efficiently monitor and manage the physical processes of various critical infrastructures. Recent incidents in cyber ecosystems have shown that CPSs are becoming increasingly vulnerable to complex attacks. These incidents often lead to sensing and actuation misbehaviour by illegal manipulations of data, which can severely impact the underlying physical processes of critical infrastructures. Current research acknowledges that IT-based security measures cannot entirely protect CPSs from such threats. Moreover, they are not designed to monitor the measurement level activities of physical processes, and they fail to mitigate blended cyberattacks, especially multi-stage and zero-day ones. This article addresses these limitations by proposing a framework, named UnSupervised Misbehaviour Detection (USMD), comprising a deep neural network that learns about a system's expected behaviour from data-driven representations. USMD can identify in real-time the attacks on CPSs by using the long-short term memory and Attention method for multi-sensor data. The USMD's performance is evaluated on various known data sets (i.e., ToN_IoT, SWaT, WADI and Gas pipeline datasets). The experimental results indicate that the superior performance of USMD compared with six state-of-the-art methods, which we implemented and extensively tested. USMD achieves F-scores of 0.9699 and 0.9702 on SWaT and WADI datasets, respectively.}

	abstract = {The complicated multi-step attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), have brought considerable threats to cybersecurity because they are naturally varied and complex. Therefore, studying the strategies of adversaries and making predictions are still significant challenges for attack prevention. To address these problems, we propose DeepAG , a framework utilizing system logs to detect threats and predict the attack paths. DeepAG leverages transformer models to novelly detect APT attack sequences by modeling semantic information of system logs. On the other hand, DeepAG utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to propose bi-directional prediction for attack paths, which achieves higher performance than traditional BiLSTM. In addition, with previously detected attack sequences and predicted paths, DeepAG constructs the attack graphs that attackers may follow to compromise the network. Furthermore, DeepAG offers the mechanisms of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) word processor and online update respectively to adapt new attack patterns that show up during detection and prediction stages. The experiments on open-source data sets show that more than 99% of over 15000 sequences can be detected accurately by DeepAG . Moreover, DeepAG can improve the baseline by 11.166% of accuracy in terms of prediction.}

	abstract = {While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved outstanding performance in extensive applications, exploiting its vulnerability with adversarial attacks is essential towards building robust DRL systems. In this work, we aim to propose a novel Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) for attacking the DRL mechanism, whereas the adversarial agent can decompose the adversarial policy into two separate sub-policies: 1) the switch policy which determines if an attacker should launch the attack, and 2) the lure policy which determines the action an attacker induces the victim to take. If the adversarial agent samples an injection action from the switch policy, the attacker can query the pre-constructed database for universal perturbation in the real-time manner, misleading the victim to take the induced action sampled from the lure policy. To train the adversarial agent to learn DAP, we utilize those samples wherein both of the sub-actions from DAP are not restricted by each other or by the external constraint, but can actually affect the attacker’s behaviors. Therefore, we propose trajectory clipping and padding in data pruning, and Decoupled Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO) in optimizing. Extensive experiments on different Atari games demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In addition, it can simultaneously implement the real-time and few-steps attack, which outperforms the existing counterparts.}

	abstract = {High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) places great emphasis on optimizing compression efficiency, where compression efficiency denotes file size ratio before and after compression. The current HEVC steganography is prone to cause degradation in compression efficiency. To analyze and avoid this problem, a Steganographic Compression Efficiency Degradation Model (SCEDM) is first proposed, which leverages the area ratio of different types of Coding Units (CU) as the distribution of block partitioning structure and combines with the K-L divergence to describe the compression efficiency degradation. By minimizing the output of the SCEDM, the degradation of compression efficiency caused by steganographies can be minimized. Besides, it is also proved that this minimizing process will not increase extra visual quality distortion. Based on this model, a novel adaptive steganography using HEVC intra block partitioning structure is proposed. This steganography consists of three parts: the CU Depth based Hierarchical Coding (CDHC) method, the structure merging strategy and the adaptive matching method. The CDHC method can convert secret binary bits to different block structures. The structure merging strategy improves the capacity, and the adaptive matching method minimizes the compression efficiency degradation according to the proposed SCEDM. The proposed steganography is further compared with state-of-the-art steganographies to confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and steganography in compression efficiency, capacity, visual quality and resistance to video steganalysis.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the booming development of RF sensing, which supports both identity authentication and behavior recognition by analysing the signal distortion caused by human body. In particular, RF-based identity authentication is more attractive to researchers, because it can capture the unique biological characteristics of users. However, the openness of wireless transmission raises privacy concerns since human behaviors could expose massive private information of users, which impedes the real-world implementation of RF-based user authentication applications. It is difficult to filter out the behavior information from the collected RF signals. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving deep neural network named BPCloak to erase the behavior information in RF signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. We conduct extensive experiments over mainstream RF signals collected from three real wireless systems, including the WiFi, radio frequency identification (RFID), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The experimental results show that BPCloak significantly reduces the behavior recognition accuracy, i.e., 85%+, 75%+, and 65%+ reduction for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave systems respectively, merely with a slight penalty of accuracy decrease when using these three systems for user authentication, i.e., 1%-, 3%-, and 5%-, respectively.}

	abstract = {The advent of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) has enabled service providers to mitigate high network latencies often encountered in accessing cloud services by deploying containerized application instances on edge servers situated near end users. MEC servers are, however, susceptible to various types of failures such as communication link failures, hardware failures and so on. A fault recovery strategy determines which MEC servers to utilize to re-deploy application containers in the event of a failure. In this work, we propose a two-fold fault recovery strategy characterized by application priority. We propose a Formal Methods driven local recovery strategy for high-priority applications. We use Stochastic Multi-Player Games as a Formal Model to characterize the interactions between the different components in an MEC environment. We use objectives specified in Probabilistic Alternating-Time Temporal Logic with a Probabilistic Model Checker to derive recovery strategies considering all possible execution scenarios of the model. For lower priority applications, we resort to a global recovery strategy by designing a greedy heuristic considering each server’s failure probability. We use benchmark datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show an average 14% reduction in latency with our approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {While existing methods can disrupt drone invasions in a protected airspace, none of them is able to accurately guide a drone to a desired location for safe handling. To address this issue, the Drone Position Manipulation (DPM) attack is proposed in this article to explore weaknesses in common navigation algorithms of consumer drones. The main advantage of DPM is that it can accurately redirect an invading drone to a desired location, by carefully crafting the spoofed guidance inputs of the drone to exploit the adjustment of path-following navigation algorithms. Compared with existing methods, this is the first work to achieve such accurate quantitative control. Another main contribution of this work is that it explores three fundamental components (i.e., guidance sensing, state estimation, and navigation control) together to enable the quantitative manipulation of flight paths, different from all existing methods. Furthermore, a formal analysis of the attack range is presented for investigating where a drone can be redirected from its target under given constraints. The evaluation on the Software-in-the-loop (SITL) module of ArduPilot system shows that the proposed attack is able to not only accurately lead a drone to a redirected destination but also make it fairly far away from its target. Lastly, the proposed attack can be applied to many autopiloted systems, because it exploits common weaknesses in these systems.}

	abstract = {Speculative execution techniques have been a cornerstone of modern processors to improve instruction-level parallelism. However, recent studies showed that this kind of techniques could be exploited by attackers to leak secret data via transient execution attacks, such as Spectre. Many defenses are proposed to address this problem, but they all face various challenges: (1) Tracking data flow in the instruction pipeline could comprehensively address this problem, but it could cause pipeline stalls and incur high performance overhead; (2) Making side effect of speculative execution imperceptible to attackers, but it often needs additional storage components and complicated data movement operations. In this article, we propose a label-based transparent speculation scheme called SpecBox . It dynamically partitions the cache system to isolate speculative data and non-speculative data, which can prevent transient execution from being observed by subsequent execution. Moreover, it uses thread ownership semaphores to prevent speculative data from being accessed across cores. In addition, SpecBox also enhances the auxiliary components in the cache system against transient execution attacks, such as hardware prefetcher. Our security analysis shows that SpecBox is secure and the performance evaluation shows that the performance overhead on SPEC CPU 2006 and PARSEC-3.0 benchmarks is small.}

	abstract = {Attribute-based access control (ABAC) models are widely used to provide fine-grained and adaptable authorization based on the attributes of users, resources, and other relevant entities. Hierarchical group and attribute based access control (HGABAC) model was recently proposed which introduces the novel notion of attribute inheritance through group membership. GURA G was subsequently proposed to provide an administrative model for user attributes in HGABAC, building upon the ARBAC97 and GURA administrative models. The GURA model uses administrative roles to manage user attributes. The reachability problem for the GURA model is to determine what attributes a particular user can acquire, given a predefined set of administrative rules. This problem has been previously analyzed in the literature. In this article, we study the user attribute reachability problem based on directly assigned attributes of the user and attributes inherited via group memberships. We first define a restricted form of GURA G , called rGURA G scheme, as a state transition system with multiple instances having different preconditions and provide reachability analysis for each of these schemes. In general, we show PSPACE-complete complexity for all rGURA G schemes. We further present polynomial time algorithms with empirical experimental evaluation to solve special instances of rGURA G schemes under restricted conditions.}

The issue of maintaining the security of these records has attracted many researchers. Thus, robust and dual watermarking based on redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT), Hessenberg Decomposition (HD), and randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) are put forward for CT scan images of COVID-19 patients. To ensure a high level of authentication, multiple watermarks in form of Electronic Patient Record (EPR) text and medical image are embedded in the cover. The EPR is encoded via turbo code to reduce /eliminate the channel noise if any. Further, both imperceptibility and robustness are achieved by a fuzzy inference system, and the marked image is encrypted using a lightweight encryption technique. Moreover, the extracted watermark is denoised using the concept of deep neural network (DNN) to improve its robustness. Experiment results and performance analyses verify the proposed dual watermarking scheme.}

	abstract = {As cloud services have become popular, and their adoption is growing, consumers are becoming more concerned about the cost of cloud services. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) generally use a pay-per-use billing scheme in the cloud services model: consumers use resources as they needed and are billed for their resource usage. However, CSPs are untrusted and privileged; they have full control of the entire operating system (OS) and may tamper with bills to cheat consumers. So, how to provide a trusted solution that can keep track of and verify the consumers’ resource usage has been a challenging problem. In this article, we propose a T-Counter framework based on Intel SGX. The T-Counter allows applications to construct a trusted solution to measure its CPU usage by itself in cloud computing. These constructed applications are instrumented with counters in basic blocks and added three components in trusted parts to count instructions and defend against malicious CSPs’ manipulations. We propose two algorithms which selectively instrument counters in the CFG. T-Counter is implemented as an extension of the LLVM framework and integrated with the SGX SDK. Theoretical analyses and evaluations show that T-Counter can effectively measure CPU usage and defend against malicious CSPs’ manipulations.}

However, Teacher models are often publicly available for sharing and reuse, which inevitably introduces vulnerability to trigger severe attacks against transfer learning systems. In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%. Our comparison also demonstrates that our design outperforms prior problematic defences.}

	abstract = {Learning-based malware detectors are widely used in practice to safeguard real-world computers. One major challenge is known as model aging, where the effectiveness of these models drops drastically as malware variants keep evolving. To tackle model aging, most existing works choose to label new samples to retrain the aged models. However, such data-perspective methods often require excessive costs in labeling and retraining. In this article, we observe that during evolution, malware samples often preserve similar malicious semantics while switching to new implementations with semantically equivalent APIs. Such observation enables us to look into the problem from a different perspective: feature space. More specifically, if the models can capture the intrinsic semantics of malware variants from feature space, it will help slow down the aging of learning-based detectors. Based on this insight, we design APIGraph to automatically extract API knowledge from API documentation and incorporate these knowledge into the training of malware detection models. We use APIGraph to enhance 5 state-of-the-art malware detectors, covering both Android and Windows platforms and various learning algorithms. Experiments on large-scale, evolutionary datasets with nearly 340K samples show that APIGraph can help slow down the aging of these models by 5.9% to 19.6%, as well as reduce labeling efforts from 33.07% to 96.30% on top of data-perspective methods.}

Given a crash, memory corruption diagnosis is expected to not only locate the root cause of the vulnerability, but also deliver rich semantics to understand the vulnerability. However, existing techniques can barely satisfy the above requirements. In this article, we present {{\\sf MemRay}}\n, a dynamic memory corruption diagnosis technique. The insight behind our approach is that most memory corruption is caused by malformed inputs, which further leads the vulnerable program to manipulate inputs by referencing invalid data structures. We design the “data structure reference sequence” to characterize how a program references various data structures to manipulate program inputs. Then, we identify memory corruptions by detecting violations in the input manipulations via data structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {{\\sf MemRay}}\non a wide range of memory-corruption vulnerabilities. The result shows that {{\\sf MemRay}}\nprecisely locates the root cause of vulnerabilities. Moreover, the “data structure reference” enables {{\\sf MemRay}}\nto deliver rich semantics and context information to assist vulnerability diagnosis on binary code.}

	abstract = {Decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) enables users to directly transfer cryptocurrencies privately without passing through a central authority. Anonymous cryptocurrencies have been proposed to improve the privacy degree of DAP systems, such as Zerocash and Monero. However, the strong degree of privacy may cause new regulatory concerns, i.e., the anonymity of transactions can be used for illegal activities, such as money laundering. In this paper, we propose a novel DAP scheme that supports regulatory compliance and enforcement. We first introduce regulators into the system, who define regulatory policies for anonymous payment, and the policies are enforced through commitments and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for compostable statements. By doing so, users can prove that transactions are valid and comply with regulations. A tracing mechanism is embedded in the scheme to allow regulators to recover the real identities of users when suspicious transactions are detected. The formal security model and proof are provided to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve desired security properties, and the performance evaluation shows its high efficiency.}

	abstract = {With emergence of smart city concept, intelligent transportation becomes one of its key enablers, with navigation as an indispensable component. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) based systems emerge to provide navigation services to vehicle users, which is characterized by employing Roadside Units (RSUs) to collect road condition information from nearby vehicles. The querying vehicle exploits the information retrieved through the RSUs to determine an optimal route. We focus on addressing two key issues in such system. First, while querying, the destination of the vehicle user should not be leaked to the queried RSU and trusted authority (TA), which is likely to be misused. Second, the navigation process should be independent of participation of the centralized TA, which can be a single point of failure. To address these issues, this article proposes a security and privacy preserved intelligent vehicle navigation system, adopting a distributed approach, to retrieve navigation without revealing the destination. The security of the system has been thoroughly evaluated using an adversary model, BAN Logic and AVISPA tool. In addition, the performance of the proposed system has been evaluated, and compared with the existing systems. The comparison illustrates that the proposed system is computationally efficient than the existing systems.}

Complete mitigation is difficult. Thus, the development of countermeasures is focused on degrading the attack effectiveness as much as possible without losing the model utilities. We investigate a novel personalized local differential privacy mechanism to defend against the attack. We obfuscate the model by adding high-dimensional Gaussian noise on model coefficients. Our solution can adaptively produce the noise to protect the model on the fly. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our mechanisms using real-world datasets. The experiment shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing differential-privacy-enabled solution, i.e., 4 times more queries are required to achieve the same attack result. We also plan to publish the relevant codes to the community for further research.}

	abstract = {Mobile applications (hereafter, apps) collect a plethora of information regarding the user behavior and his device through third-party analytics libraries. However, the collection and usage of such data raised several privacy concerns, mainly because the end-user - i.e., the actual owner of the data - is out of the loop in this collection process. Also, the existing privacy-enhanced solutions that emerged in the last years follow an ”all or nothing” approach, leaving the user the sole option to accept or completely deny access to privacy-related data. This work has the two-fold objective of assessing the privacy impact of mobile analytics libraries and proposing a data anonymization methodology that offers a trade-off between the utility and privacy of the collected data and enables complete control over the sharing process. To achieve that, we present an empirical privacy assessment on the analytics libraries used in the 4500 most-used Android apps of the Google Play Store in late 2020. Then, we propose an empowered anonymization methodology, based on MobHide (Caputo et al. , 2020), that gives the end-user complete control over the collection and anonymization process. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our solution thanks to HideDroid, a fully-fledged anonymization app for the Android ecosystem.}

	abstract = {Federated learning has recently emerged as a paradigm promising the benefits of harnessing rich data from diverse sources to train high quality models, with the salient features that training datasets never leave local devices. Only model updates are locally computed and shared for aggregation to produce a global model. While federated learning greatly alleviates the privacy concerns as opposed to learning with centralized data, sharing model updates still poses privacy risks. In this paper, we present a system design which offers efficient protection of individual model updates throughout the learning procedure, allowing clients to only provide obscured model updates while a cloud server can still perform the aggregation. Our federated learning system first departs from prior works by supporting lightweight encryption and aggregation, and resilience against drop-out clients with no impact on their participation in future rounds. Meanwhile, prior work largely overlooks bandwidth efficiency optimization in the ciphertext domain and the support of security against an actively adversarial cloud server, which we also fully explore in this paper and provide effective and efficient mechanisms. Extensive experiments over several benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA) show our system achieves accuracy comparable to the plaintext baseline, with practical performance.}

	abstract = {Voiceprint Authentication as a Service (VAaS) offers great convenience due to ubiquity, generality, and usability. Despite its attractiveness, it suffers from user voiceprint leakage over the air or at the cloud, which intrudes user voice privacy and retards its wide adoption. The literature still lacks an effective solution on this issue. Traditional methods based on cryptography are too complex to be practically deployed while other approaches distort user voiceprints, which hinders accurate user identification. In this article, we propose a leakage resilient user authentication cloud service with privacy preservation based on random personal voice challenges, named VOLERE (VOice LEakage REsilient). It applies a novel voiceprint synthesis method based on a Log Magnitude Approximate (LMA) vocal tract model to fuse original voices of different speaking modes in order to generate a synthesized voiceprint for authentication. Thus, raw voiceprints of users can be well protected. We implement VOLERE and conduct a series of user tests. Experimental results show sound performance of VOLERE regarding authentication accuracy, efficiency, stability, leakage resilience and user acceptance. In particular, its authentication accuracy is reasonably stable regardless user nationality, gender, age, elapsed time, and environment, as well as variance of speaking modes.}

Owing to the various features provided by mobile devices, a user's online social activities are tightly tied to his phone, and are conveniently, sometimes unnecessarily, available to social networks. In this article, we propose a novel attack architecture to show that attackers can infer a user's social network identities behind a mobile device through new dimensions. Specifically, we first developed a correlation between a user's device system states and the social network events, which leverage multiple mechanisms such as the learning-based memory regression model, to infer the possible accounts of the user in the social network app. Then we exploited the social network to social network correlation, via which we correlated information across different social networks, to identify the accounts of the target user. We implemented and evaluated these attacks on three popular social networks, and the results corroborate the effectiveness of our design.}

TrustZone-M, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Cortex-M processors, ensures stronger security within an IoT device by allowing isolated execution of security-critical operations, without trusting the entire software stack. However, TrustZone-M does not guarantee secure cross-world communication between applications in the Normal and Secure worlds. The cryptographic protection of the communication channel is an obvious solution; however, within a low-power IoT device, it incurs high overhead if applied to each cross-world message exchange. We present ShieLD, a framework that enables a secure communication channel between the two TrustZone-M worlds by leveraging the Memory Protection Unit (MPU). ShieLD guarantees confidentiality, integrity and authentication services without requiring any cryptographic operations. We implement and evaluate ShieLD using a Musca-A test chip board with Cortex-M33 that supports TrustZone-M. Our empirical evaluation shows, among other gains, the cross-zone communication protected with ShieLD is 5 times faster than the conventional crypto-based communication.}

Due to a lack of sufficient capacity in the network, high-valued payments are split and routed via multiple paths. Existing multi-path payment protocols either fail to achieve atomicity or are susceptible to wormhole attack. We propose a secure and privacy-preserving atomic multi-path payment protocol CryptoMaze. Our protocol avoids the formation of multiple off-chain contracts on edges shared by the paths routing partial payments. It also guarantees unlinkability between partial payments. We provide a formal definition of the protocol in the Universal Composability framework and analyze the security. We implement CryptoMaze on several instances of Lightning Network and simulated networks. Our protocol requires 11s for routing a payment of 0.04 BTC on a network instance comprising 25600 nodes. The communication cost is less than 1MB in the worst-case. On comparing the performance of CryptoMaze with several state-of-the-art payment protocols, we observed that our protocol outperforms the rest in terms of computational cost and has a feasible communication overhead.}

Prior work has addressed this issue mainly from a technical perspective and neglected other interfering aspects such as the social media dimension. To fill this gap, we propose STRisk which is a predictive system where we expand the scope of the prediction task by bringing into play the social media dimension. We study over 3800 US organizations including both victim and non-victim organizations. For each organization, we design a profile composed of a variety of externally measured technical indicators and social factors. In addition, to account for unreported incidents, we consider the non-victim sample to be noisy and propose a noise correction approach to correct mislabeled organizations. We then build several machine learning models to predict whether an organization is exposed to experience a hacking breach. By exploiting both technical and social features, we achieve a Area Under Curve (AUC) score exceeding 98%, which is 12% higher than the AUC achieved using only technical features. Furthermore, our feature importance analysis reveals that open ports and expired certificates are the best technical predictors, while spreadability and agreeability are the best social predictors.}

However, designing secure and efficient solutions, such as authentication protocols, for the many different embedded systems with varying internal communication modes remains challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight authenticated key-exchange (AKE) protocol for EIESs based on half-duplex and “command/response” bus. Specifically, the proposed protocol is designed to operate on resource-constrained devices, as well as having minimal number of interactions. We then prove the security of the proposed protocol and present the security parameter selection strategy for protocol implementation based on the empirical evaluations. Moreover, efficiency analysis also shows that the protocol can be effectively deployed in the EIESs environment.}

In particular, we first propose a purpose-aware access control (PAAC) model, which introduces new concepts of data processing purpose and data operation purpose and an automatic purpose analysis algorithm that identifies purposes from data analytics operations and queries. Moreover, we develop a unified access control mechanism that implements PAAC model in two modules. GuardSpark++ supports structured data access control in Spark Catalyst and GuardDAG supports unstructured data access control in Spark core. Finally, we evaluate GuardSpark++ and GuardDAG with multiple data sources, applications, and data analytics engines. Experimental results show that SparkAC provides effective access control functionalities with very small (GuardSpark++) or medium (GuardDAG) performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain a prevalent threat on low-cost bare-metal devices. Fuzzing is a popular technique for automatically discovering such vulnerabilities. However, bare-metal devices lack even basic security mechanisms such as Memory Management Unit. Consequently, fuzzing approaches encounter silent memory corruptions with no visible effects, making even discovery difficult. Once discovered, it is also essential to identify the type of observed vulnerability for applying mitigation. Both discovery and identification remain open challenges in the case of fuzzing firmware binaries. This article addresses these problems by proposing an automated instrumentation technique that allows the observation of memory corruption vulnerabilities that are otherwise not observable and facilitates the automated identification of the observed vulnerability. Additionally, we surveyed state-of-the-art IoT fuzzers and analyzed their experimental methodologies. We found that existing approaches have fundamental problems that lead to incorrect or misleading results. To evaluate the effectiveness of IoT fuzzers, it is essential to determine the range and type of vulnerabilities that these fuzzers can discover. Thus, we propose the first ground-truth benchmark suite for IoT fuzzers that enables accurate and consistent evaluation of their vulnerability-finding performance. Our instrumentation framework's efficacy and efficiency in combination with state-of-the-art IoT fuzzers are assessed using the proposed benchmark.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement in machine learning (ML), ML-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely deployed to protect networks from various attacks. One of the biggest challenges is that ML-based IDSs suffer from adversarial example (AE) attacks. By applying small perturbations (e.g., slightly increasing packet inter-arrival time) to the intrusion traffic, an AE attack can flip the prediction of a well-trained IDS. We address this challenge by proposing MANDA , a MANifold and Decision boundary-based AE detection system. Through analyzing AE attacks, we notice that 1) an AE tends to be close to its original manifold (i.e., the cluster of samples in its original class) regardless of which class it is misclassified into; and 2) AEs tend to be close to the decision boundary to minimize the perturbation scale. Based on the two observations, we design MANDA for accurate AE detection by exploiting inconsistency between manifold evaluation and IDS model inference and evaluating model uncertainty on small perturbations. We evaluate MANDA on both binary IDS and multi-class IDS on two datasets (NSL-KDD and CICIDS) under three state-of-the-art AE attacks. Our experimental results show that MANDA achieves high true-positive rate (98.41%) with a 5% false-positive rate.}

	abstract = {We investigate the extent to which redundancy (including with diversity) can help mitigate the impact of cyber attacks that aim to reduce system performance. Using analytical techniques, we estimate impacts, in terms of monetary costs, of penalties from breaching Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and find optimal resource allocations to minimize the overall costs arising from attacks. Our approach combines attack impact analysis, based on performance modeling using queueing networks, with an attack model based on attack graphs. We evaluate our approach using a case study of a website, and show how resource redundancy and diversity can improve the resilience of a system by reducing the likelihood of a fully disruptive attack. We find that the cost-effectiveness of redundancy depends on the SLA terms, the probability of attack detection, the time to recover, and the cost of maintenance. In our case study, redundancy with diversity achieved a saving of up to around 50 percent in expected attack costs relative to no redundancy. The overall benefit over time depends on how the saving during attacks compares to the added maintenance costs due to redundancy.}

	abstract = {Online Microlending, a new financial service, focuses on small loans without any sort of collateral. It provides more flexible and quicker funding for borrowers, as well as higher interest rates of return. For platforms that provide such services, an essential task is to adequately evaluate each loan’s risk so as to minimize the possible financial loss. However, there exists a special group of borrowers, namely fraud-agents , who gain illegal profits from inciting other borrowers to cheat, i.e., they help the high-risk borrowers evade the risk evaluation by crafting fake personal information. The existence of fraud-agents poses a severe threat to the risk management systems and results in a huge financial loss for lending platforms. In this article, we present the first machine learning-based solution to detect fraud-agents in online microlending. The key challenge of this decade-long problem is that it is unclear how to construct effective features from multiple behavior logs such as phone call history, address book, loan history and activity logs of borrowers. To address this problem, we first conduct an empirical study on over 600K borrowers to gain some insights on the adversarial behaviors of fraud-agents comparing to normal borrowers and benign-agents. Based on the study, we are able to design a total of 26 features, falling into four groups, for fraud agent detection. Then, we propose a two-stage detection model to address the challenge of limited number of labeled fraud agent examples. The evaluation results show that our method can achieve a precision of 94.30%. We deploy our method on a real large online microlending platform with 11,953,273 borrowers, and we identify 29,727 fraud-agents from them. The domain experts from the platform confirm that 95.59% of them are real fraud-agents, and have added them to the platform’s internal blacklist. We further conduct a measurement study on those fraud-agents to share deeper insights on their adversarial behaviors.}

A thorough meta-analysis or systematic review is required to gain a better understanding of these findings and to assess the strength of evidence for phishing susceptibility of a subpopulation, e.g., older users. We aim to determine whether an effect exists; another aim is to determine whether the effect is positive or negative and to obtain a single summary estimate of the effect. OBJECTIVES: We systematically review the results of previous user studies on phishing susceptibility and conduct a meta-analysis. METHOD: We searched four online databases for English studies on phishing. We included all user studies in phishing detection and prevention, whether they proposed new training techniques or analyzed users’ vulnerability. FINDINGS: A careful analysis reveals some discrepancies between the findings. More than half of the studies that analyzed the effect of age reported no statistically significant relationship between age and users’ performance. Some studies reported older people performed better while some reported the opposite. A similar finding holds for the gender difference. The meta-analysis shows: 1) a significant relationship between participants’ age and their susceptibility 2) females are more susceptible than males 3) users training significantly improves their detection ability.}

	abstract = {Detecting fake accounts (sybils) in online social networks (OSNs) is vital to protect OSN operators and their users from various malicious activities. Typical graph-based sybil detection (a mainstream methodology) assumes that sybils can make friends with only a limited (or small) number of honest users. However, recent evidences showed that this assumption does not hold in real-world OSNs, leading to low detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we explore users’ activities to assist sybil detection. The intuition is that honest users are much more selective in choosing who to interact with than to befriend with. We first develop the social and activity network (SAN), a two-layer hyper-graph that unifies users’ friendships and their activities, to fully utilize users’ activities. We also propose a more practical sybil attack model, where sybils can launch both friendship attacks and activity attacks. We then design Sybil_SAN to detect sybils via coupling three random walk-based algorithms on the SAN, and prove the convergence of Sybil_SAN. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm to compute the detection metric for Sybil_SAN, and derive the number of rounds needed to guarantee the convergence. We use “matrix perturbation theory” to bound the detection error when sybils launch many friendship attacks and activity attacks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Sybil_SAN is highly robust against sybil attacks, and can detect sybils accurately under practical scenarios, where current state-of-art sybil defenses have low accuracy. Lastly, we present two extensions of Sybil_SAN to further improve its accuracy.}

	abstract = {PIN authentication is widely used on mobile devices due to its usability and simplicity. However, it is known to be susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks, where an adversary spies the user’s PIN by direct human observation or camera-based recording. This paper proposes PressPIN, a novel enhanced PIN authenticator on mobile devices by sensing pressures from the user’s finger. Since pressure-sensitive touch screens are unavailable on most phones, we leverage the structure-borne propagation of sounds to estimate the pressure on the screen. When the user inputs the PINs, the pressure is extracted from each number to form the\nn\n-bit pressure code, where\nn\ncorresponds to the length of the PIN sequence. The pressure code is difficult to be inferred by snooping or videotaping, and increases the entropy of passwords. In this way, PressPIN provides a low-cost, user-friendly, and more secure solution resistant to shoulder surfing attacks. Our extensive experiments with 30 participants and three types of smartphones demonstrate that PressPIN can authenticate legitimate users with high accuracy (e.g., as high as 96.7% within two trials), and is robust to various types of attacks (e.g., only 2.5% attack success rate even when the adversary can observe the legitimate user’s PIN sequence and finger pressing clearly). Additionally, PressPIN requires no additional hardware (e.g., the pressure sensor) and can be readily integrated into existing authentication systems of mobile devices.}

	abstract = {Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) aims at detecting the association between diseases and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with statistical techniques and has great potential for disease diagnosis. To obtain high-quality results, GWAS requires large-scale genomic data containing individuals’ privacy information. Thus, how to improve the efficiency of GWAS while protecting the privacy of genomic data becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient GWAS scheme. By using secure three-party computation, we present a series of protocols, i.e., Secure Quality Control, Secure Principle Component Analysis, Secure Cochran-Armitage trend test, and Secure Logistic Regression, to cover the most significant procedures of secure GWAS. In these protocols, a new comparison protocol is designed to reduce communication and improve efficiency. Furthermore, by extending the above comparison protocol to be maliciously secure and utilizing other technologies, e.g., consistency check, we extend the whole GWAS scheme to malicious security with rationally additional overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our protocols achieve about 33% performance improvement than the state-of-art secure GWAS scheme using two-party computation in terms of runtime and communication in the semi-honest setting. The cost of our scheme in the malicious setting is around 1.5X than that in the semi-honest setting.}

However, the adoption of E2EE has been limited to messengers, and has not yet seen a noticeable trace in social network platforms, despite the increase in users’ privacy violations. In this paper, we propose, verify, implement and evaluate a novel E2EE protocol – Stick. Stick is a Signal-based protocol tailored for social network platforms. We believe our protocol is the first to support re-establishable encryption sessions in an asynchronous multi-device setting while preserving forward secrecy and introducing backward secrecy. Stick includes several innovative features, including a new session concept, multiple pairwise sessions and refreshing identity keys. We verified Stick using Verifpal - a formal verification tool in the symbolic model. Our security analysis shows our protocol does achieve a form of post-compromise security in many-to-many communications – the trait most group protocols lack. Most importantly, the Stick protocol can re-establish encryption sessions while ensuring authentication and confidentiality. We implemented our protocol as a stand-alone open-source API. Our evaluation shows the Stick protocol can be used in a real-world social network app with no noticeable compromise on usability or performance.}

	abstract = {Cyber vulnerabilities are security deficiencies in computer and network systems of organizations, which can be exploited by an adversary to cause significant damage. The technology and security personnel resources currently available in organizations to mitigate the vulnerabilities are highly inadequate. As a result, systems routinely remain unpatched, thus making them vulnerable to security breaches from the adversaries. The potential consequences of an exploited vulnerability depend upon the context as well as the severity of the vulnerability, which may differ among networks and organizations. Furthermore, security personnel tend to have varying levels of expertise and technical proficiencies associated with different computer and network devices. There exists a critical need to develop a resource-constrained approach for effectively identifying and mitigating important context-sensitive cyber vulnerabilities. In this article, we develop an advanced analytics and optimization framework to address this need and compare our approach with rule-based methods employed in real-world cybersecurity operations centers, as well as a vulnerability prioritization method from recent literature. First, we propose a machine learning-based vulnerability priority scoring system (VPSS) to calculate the priority scores for each of the vulnerabilities found in an organization’s network and quantify organizational context-based vulnerability exposure. Next, we propose a decision-support system, which consists of a two-step sequential optimization approach. The first model selects the high priority vulnerability instances from the dense report subject to resource constraints, and the second model then optimally allocates them to the security personnel with matching skill types for mitigation. Experiment results conducted using a real-world vulnerability data set show that our approach 1) outperforms both the rule-based methods and the vulnerability prioritization method from literature in prioritizing context-sensitive vulnerabilities, which are found across highly susceptible organizationally relevant host machines, and 2) maximizes the pairs of vulnerability instance type and the respective security analyst skill type for optimal mitigation.}

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things enables interconnection of billions of devices, which perform autonomous operations and collect various types of data. These things, along with their generated huge amount of data, need to be handled efficiently and securely. Centralized solutions are not desired due to security concerns and scalability issue. In this article, we propose HIBEChain, a hierarchical blockchain system that realizes scalable and accountable management of IoT devices and data. HIBEChain consists of multiple permissioned blockchains that form a hierarchical tree structure. To support the hierarchical structure of HIBEChain, we design a decentralized hierarchical identity-based signature (DHIBS) scheme, which enables IoT devices to use their identities as public keys. Consequently, HIBEChain achieves high scalability through parallel processing as blockchain sharding schemes, and it also implements accountability by use of identity-based keys. Identity-based keys not only make HIBEChain more user-friendly, they also allow private key recovery by validators when necessary. We provide detailed analysis of its security and performance, and implement HIBEChain based on Ethereum source code. Experiment results show that a 6-ary, (7,10)-threshold, 4-level HIBEChain can achieve 32,000 TPS, and it needs only 9 seconds to confirm a transaction.}

	abstract = {The distributed cryptocurrency networking is critical because the information delivered through it drives the mining consensus protocol and the rest of the operations. However, the cryptocurrency peer-to-peer (P2P) network remains vulnerable, and the existing security approaches are either ineffective or inefficient because of the permissionless requirement and the broadcasting overhead. We design and build a Lightweight and Identifier-Oblivious eNgine (LION) for the anomaly detection of the cryptocurrency networking. LION is not only effective in permissionless networking but is also lightweight and practical for the computation-intensive miners. We build LION for anomaly detection and use traffic analyses so that it minimally affects the mining rate and is substantially superior in its computational efficiency than the previous approaches based on machine learning. We implement a LION prototype on an active Bitcoin node to show that LION yields less than 1% of mining rate reduction subject to our prototype, in contrast to the state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches costing 12% or more depending on the algorithms subject to our prototype as well, while having detection accuracy of greater than 97% F1-score against the attack prototypes and real-world anomalies. LION therefore can be deployed on the existing miners without the need to introduce new entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.}

	abstract = {Skyline queries, especially those variants that allow users to define their own query criteria, are very promising and practical techniques in multi-criteria decision making applications. Meanwhile, the growing data volume drives the service providers to outsource their data to the cloud for reaping economic benefits. However, privacy concerns compel the outsourced data to be encrypted and require to perform the skyline queries over encrypted data. To achieve the privacy-preserving skyline queries, many schemes were proposed in the literature. However, those existing solutions cannot fully support the user-defined query criteria in skyline queries, and most of them employ a two-server model to support skyline queries over ciphertexts, which needs multi-round communications between the deployed two servers. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving user-defined skyline query scheme in a single-server model, which eliminates extra communications. Specifically, we first formally define the user-defined skyline query. Then, based on the idea of converting order relations into computing the inner products of two multi-dimensional points, we design three predicate encryption schemes. Finally, we adopt these predicate encryption schemes to construct our proposed scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that these predicate encryption schemes are selectively secure, and the proposed user-defined skyline query scheme is privacy-preserving. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the alternative scheme by up to an order of magnitude in terms of computational costs when performing user-defined skyline queries.}

	abstract = {The emerging blockchain technology, combined with the smart contract paradigm, is expected to transform traditional applications with decentralization. When the blockchain technology is applied to decentralize traditional applications, blockchain validators may need to take in sensitive off-chain data to execute a smart contract. On the one hand, decentralized applications (DApps) require authentic off-chain input data to correctly execute a given business procedure. On the other hand, users are reluctant to expose their sensitive privacy on the blockchain. For example, for a decentralized medical insurance DApp that takes as input personal health data, it is critical to guarantee authenticity and privacy of the data sent to the smart contract, such that the data can be verified by validators without leaking sensitive information. However, no satisfactory solution has been proposed to attain privacy and authenticity at the same time. In this work, we first present a highly efficient authenticated zero knowledge proof protocol called zk-DASNARK by extending the classical zk-SNARK scheme with data authentication. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated off-chain data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for blockchain-based DApps. Following the strategy of “compute off-chain and verify on-chain”, zk-AuthFeed can significantly reduce computation cost of blockchain validators. We fully implement a prototype of zk-AuthFeed, and conduct comprehensive experiments on a medical insurance DApp. We consider 4 typical computation models for insurance premium/reimbursement in the experiments. It shows that zk-AuthFeed is highly efficient: key generation takes about 10 seconds only, proof generation takes less than 4 seconds, and proof verification takes less than 40 ms.}

	abstract = {Outsourcing encrypted time series data and query services to a cloud has been widely adopted by data owners for economic considerations. However, it inevitably lowers data utility and query efficiency. Existing secure skyline query schemes either leak critical information or are inefficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving interval skyline query scheme by employing symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE). Specifically, we first devise a secure sort protocol to sort the encrypted dataset and a secure high-dimensional dominance check protocol to securely determine dominance relations of time series data, in which a dominance check tree is presented. With these secure protocols, we propose our secure skyline computation protocol that can ensure both security and efficiency. Furthermore, to deal with the characteristics of time series data, we design a look-up table to index time series for quick query response. The security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can protect outsourced data, query results, and single-dimensional privacy and hide access patterns. In addition, we evaluate our proposed scheme and compare the core component of our scheme with the state-of-the-art solution, and the results indicate that our protocol outperforms the compared solution by two orders of magnitude in the computational cost and at least 23× in the communication cost.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular option for users to store and share data. Encryption prior to outsourcing data to the cloud is the best way to protect data security and privacy; however, it hinders sharing of the data that was encrypted. In addition, users in many real-world organizations (e.g., enterprises) have multiple level structures and a higher-level user should have the privilege to decide which data can be shared with a lower-level user. Most solutions in the literature suffer from inefficiency or inflexibility in tackling this problem. In this article, we propose a fine-grained hierarchical data sharing (FHDS) scheme in clouds. With FHDS, the data owner can encrypt data with his public key, and then selectively share encrypted data with users in a hierarchy; if necessary, the users can disseminate the owner's data to their subordinates in the lower levels by generating access keys. In particular, the higher-level users could puncture the keys with some tags such that the part of the owner's data which is labeled by the punctured tags will not be accessible to the lower-level users. The proposed scheme is provable secure under our security model and performance analyses show the efficiency of the scheme.}

	abstract = {The stochastic multi-armed bandit is a classical reinforcement learning model, where a learning agent sequentially chooses an action (pull a bandit arm) and the environment responds with a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown distribution associated with the chosen action. A popular objective for the agent is to identify the arm having the maximum expected reward, also known as the best arm identification problem. We address the security concerns that occur in a cross-silo federated learning setting, where multiple data owners collaborate under the orchestration of a server to execute a best arm identification algorithm. We propose three secure protocols, which guarantee desirable security properties for the: input data (i.e., reward values), intermediate data (i.e., sums of rewards), and output data (i.e., ranking of arms and in particular the identified best arm). More precisely: (1) no data owner can learn the identified best arm; moreover, no data owner can learn local data pertaining to another data owner; (2) the orchestration participants cannot learn the identified best arm, any reward value, or any sum of rewards; (3) by analyzing the messages exchanged over the network, an external observer cannot learn the identified best arm, or any reward value, or any sum of rewards. Each protocol has a different architecture, uses different techniques, and proposes a different trade-off with respect to several criteria that we thoroughly analyze: number of participants, generality of the supported reward functions, cryptographic overhead, and communication cost. To build our protocols, we rely on secure multi-party computation, AES-CBC, and the additive homomorphic property of Paillier.}

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based semantics-preserving (i.e. functionality-preserving) attack against black-box GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for malware detection. The key factor of adversarial malware generation via semantic Nops insertion is to select the appropriate semantic Nops and their corresponding basic blocks. The proposed attack uses reinforcement learning to automatically make these “how to select” decisions. To evaluate the attack, we have trained two kinds of GNNs with three types (e.g., Backdoor, Trojan, and Virus) of Windows malware samples and various benign Windows programs. The evaluation results have shown that the proposed attack can achieve a significantly higher evasion rate than four baseline attacks, namely the binary diversification attack, the semantics-preserving random instruction insertion attack, the semantics-preserving accumulative instruction insertion attack, and the semantics-preserving gradient-based instruction insertion attack.}

	abstract = {Steganalysis is a collection of techniques used to detect whether secret information is embedded in a carrier using steganography. Most of the existing steganalytic methods are based on machine learning, which requires training a classifier with “laboratory” data. However, applying machine-learning classification to a new data source is challenging, since there is typically a mismatch between the training and the testing sets. In addition, other sources of uncertainty affect the steganlytic process, including the mismatch between the targeted and the actual steganographic algorithms, unknown parameters –such as the message length– and having a mixture of several algorithms and parameters, which would constitute a realistic scenario. This article presents subsequent embedding as a valuable strategy that can be incorporated into modern steganalysis. Although this solution has been applied in previous works, a theoretical basis for this strategy was missing. Here, we cover this research gap by introducing the “directionality” property of features concerning data embedding. Once a consistent theoretical framework sustains this strategy, new practical applications are also described and tested against standard steganography, moving steganalysis closer to real-world conditions.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of intelligent applications, many Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed in various application scenarios, playing an extremely important role. Remote attestation is an important method to ensure the software integrity of these devices and protect them from several attacks. Due to the lack of security hardware and no support of hardware extensions for Class-1 IoT devices, it is particularly important to design a suitable remote attestation scheme for these devices. In this paper, we first propose the delayed observation mechanism to alleviate the problem that the software-based remote attestation scheme is not suitable for wireless networks. At the same time, we propose a ”filling memory at attestation-time” mechanism, which solves the problem that attackers hide malicious code through return-oriented programming. Finally, we introduce a reputation mechanism to assist our attestation, and adopt the principle of ”making higher-performance verification nodes take on more work” to greatly reduce the time-consuming attestation. We analyze the security of the scheme and implement it on a UNO-R3 development board to prove its practicability and effectiveness. Compared with traditional software-based attestation schemes, our scheme can reduce the attestation time and resist proxy attacks.}

Most membership inference attacks rely on confidence scores from the victim model for the attack purpose. However, a few studies indicate that prediction labels of the victim model's output are sufficient for launching successful attacks. Besides the well-studied classification models, segmentation models are also vulnerable to this type of attack. In this article, for the first time, we propose the label-only membership inference attacks against semantic segmentation models. With a well-designed framework of the attacks, we can achieve a considerably higher successful attacking rate compared to previous work. In addition, we have discussed several possible defense mechanisms to counter such a threat.}

	abstract = {The existence of native code in Android apps plays an important role in triggering inconspicuous propagation of secrets and circumventing malware detection. However, the state-of-the-art information-flow analysis tools for Android apps all have limited capabilities of analyzing native code. Due to the complexity of binary-level static analysis, most static analyzers choose to build conservative models for a selected portion of native code. Though the recent inter-language analysis improves the capability of tracking information flow in native code, it is still far from attaining similar effectiveness of the state-of-the-art information-flow analyzers that focus on non-native Java methods. To overcome the above constraints, we propose a new analysis framework,\nμ\nDep, to detect sensitive information flows of the Android apps containing native code. In this framework, we combine a control-flow based static binary analysis with a mutation-based dynamic analysis to model the tainting behaviors of native code in the apps. Based on the result of the analyses,\nμ\nDep conducts a stub generation for the related native functions to facilitate the state-of-the-art analyzer DroidSafe with fine-grained tainting behavior summaries of native code. The experimental results show that our framework is competitive on the accuracy, and effective in analyzing the information flows in real-world apps and malware compared with the state-of-the-art inter-language static analysis.}

	abstract = {Covert communication channels can be easily constructed using text steganography based on social media. Offenders can easily utilize these channels to engage in various criminal activities, which brings great challenges in maintaining the security of cyberspace. Among the text information hiding methods, generative linguistic steganography poses the biggest threat to network security because it does not need the original carrier and has high embedding efficiency. The existing generative linguistic steganalysis methods fail to deeply mine text word relation, hence the detection performance is relatively unsatisfactory. In this article, we prove that there is explicit and latent steganography-sensitive text word relation. Based on this, we propose a generative linguistic steganalysis method based on E xplicit and L atent text word relation M ining, named ELM . First, we employ a distributed readin module to convert words into real number vectors. Then, MRA (Mining Relation by Attentions) is proposed to mine the explicit and latent text word relation. Finally, global adaptive classification module is presented to exploit the mined relation feature to predict whether secret information is embedded in the current text segment. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of ELM is better than the existing generative linguistic steganalysis methods.}

	abstract = {Bloom filters are widely used in networking and computing to accelerate membership checking. In many applications filters store sensitive data, so their privacy is of primary concern. At first glance, it seems that extracting the set of elements inserted from the filter would not be possible, because in Bloom filters elements are mapped to positions using hash functions. However, previous works have shown that for the Bloom filter, it may be possible to identify few of the elements inserted in the filter. In this work, we consider the case of counting Bloom filters (CBFs) and show that in some cases, the entire set of elements used to create the filter can be extracted from the filter. This poses serious privacy and security concerns when an attacker can get access to the filter contents. In this article, an algorithm to extract the elements inserted from the filter is presented and analyzed theoretically; then, the feasibility of the CBF inversion is shown by simulation. A case study is presented in detail to illustrate that in practical applications, these conditions can be met by using additional restrictions that are implicit in the nature of the application itself.}

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) has gained significant attention as the future deployment platform for the Internet and enterprise networks. The major advantages of SDN include effective traffic management, dynamic configuration of policy and flow rules, and better scalability with heterogeneous traffic requirements. However, centralized network control and the use of OpenFlow protocols introduce various security challenges for the underlying network. The attacks on the SDN controller is critical as it hosts all network control functions. Motivated by a systematic analysis of different attack scenarios in SDN using the STRIDE attack model, this article presents an effective security enforcement framework for proactive prevention of potential attacks on SDN controllers. First, based on a signaling game approach, we design a trust-based controller attack detection (TCAD) model that calculates the trust value of each incoming packet to take necessary action. Next, we propose a risk-based attack prevention (RAP) model that detects and filters malicious traffic flows in the network. Finally, we evaluate our proposed security enforcement framework on different scenarios with varying traffic requirements and by injecting attacks based on the STRIDE model. Experimental results show 95% accuracy in the potential attack detection and prevention.}

	abstract = {Social bots are intelligent programs that control the behavior of fake accounts in an online social network(OSN). They pass themselves off as human accounts and manipulate the health of the ecosystem of OSNs. Thus, it is crucial to distinguish social bots from human accounts. Despite recent advances in social bot detection, state-of-the-art methods face challenges in scalability, generalization, and robustness. Considering these drawbacks, in this article, a new category of features, called friendship preference, is proposed. Friendship preference features are extracted from the profile attributes of the followers. The proposed feature extraction formula is designed to be scalable as the number of followers grows. Two classifiers are developed to evaluate the proposed category of features in terms of efficiency and usefulness. The classifiers are benchmarked on several real datasets. The experimental results indicate that the classifiers outperform Botometer in terms of classification performance. Scalability is assessed by inspecting the detection performance of classifiers when the attributes of a limited number of the accounts in the neighborhood of the users with large egonets are available. Furthermore, generalization is validated by crossover validation on various datasets. Finally, robustness and the ability for early detection of social bots are discussed.}

	abstract = {The structure function is an often-used mathematical representation of the investigated system in reliability analysis. It is a binary function that models a system state according to the states of its components. The size of the structure function depends on the number of components and can be enormous for systems with many components. Therefore, the system reliability analysis based on the structure function needs special methods to decrease this dimension and to measure the system reliability. The concept of survival signature provides a useful transformation of the structure function to simplify reliability assessment for systems with many components of specified types. The survival signature is a complete probabilistic description of the system. The new methods and algorithms of system reliability analysis based on this mathematical representation should be developed. The Direct Partial Logic Derivative is one of the approaches that are effective in system reliability evaluation based on the structure function. This approach is used to determine different aspects of system failure depending on system components breakdowns. The development of this derivative for survival signature permits to obtain the new method for the reliability analysis of system failure caused by system component breakdown depending on components types.}

	abstract = {Current collision avoidance techniques deployed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on short-range sensors, such as proximity sensors, cameras, and microphones. Unfortunately, their efficiency is significantly limited in several situations; for instance, when a remote UAV approaches at high velocity, or when the surrounding environment is impaired (e.g., fog, noise). In the cited cases, to avoid collisions and maintain self-separation, UAVs often rely on the indiscriminate broadcast of their location. Therefore, an adversary could easily identify the location of the UAV and attack it, e.g., by physically shutting it down, launching wireless jamming attacks, or continuing tracking its movements. To address the above-introduced threats, in this article we present PPCA, a lightweight, distributed, and privacy-preserving scheme to avoid collisions among UAVs. Our solution, based on an ingenious tessellation of the space, is accompanied by a thorough analytical model and is supported by an extensive experimental campaign performed on a real 3DR-Solo drone. The achieved results are striking: PPCA can efficiently and effectively avoid collisions among UAVs, by requiring a limited bandwidth and computational overhead (84.85% less than traditional privacy-preserving proximity testing approaches), while providing unique benefits in terms of privacy of the participating UAVs.}

	abstract = {The configuration of security functions in computer networks is still typically performed manually, which likely leads to security breaches and long re-configuration times. This problem is exacerbated for modern networks based on network virtualization, because their complexity and dynamics make a correct manual configuration practically unfeasible. This article focuses on packet filters, i.e., the most common firewall technology used in computer networks, and it proposes a new methodology to automatically define the allocation scheme and configuration of packet filters in the logical topology of a virtual network. The proposed method is based on solving a carefully designed partial weighted Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem by means of a state-of-the-art solver. This approach formally guarantees the correctness of the solution, i.e., that all security requirements are satisfied, and it minimizes the number of needed firewalls and firewall rules. This methodology is extensively evaluated using different metrics and tests on both synthetic and real use cases, and compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, showing its superiority.}

	abstract = {Confidential computing aims to secure the code and data in use by providing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for applications using hardware features such as Intel SGX. Timing and cache side-channel attacks, however, are often outside the scope of the threat model, although once exploited they are able to break all the default security guarantees enforced by hardware. Unfortunately, tools detecting potential side-channel vulnerabilities within applications are limited and usually ignore the strong attack model and the unique programming model imposed by Intel SGX. This article proposes a precise side-channel analysis tool, ENCIDER, detecting both timing and cache side-channel vulnerabilities within SGX applications via inferring potential timing observation points and incorporating the SGX programming model into analysis. ENCIDER uses dynamic symbolic execution to decompose the side-channel requirement based on the bounded non-interference property and implements byte-level information flow tracking via API modeling. We have applied ENCIDER to 4 real-world SGX applications, 2 SGX crypto libraries, and 3 widely-used crypto libraries, and found 29 timing side channels and 73 code and data cache side channels. We also compare ENCIDER with three state-of-the-art side channel analysis tools using their benchmarks. ENCIDER does not only report most of the bugs with 20%-50% run time improvement and 65%-92% memory usage improvement, but also detects 9 missing bugs from these tools. We have reported our findings to the corresponding parties, e.g., Intel and ARM, who have confirmed most of the vulnerabilities detected.}

	abstract = {Android allows apps to communicate with its system services via system service helpers so that these apps can use various functions provided by the system services. Meanwhile, the system services rely on their service helpers to enforce security checks for protection. Unfortunately, the security checks in the service helpers may be bypassed via directly exploiting the non-SDK (hidden) APIs, degrading the stability and posing severe security threats such as privilege escalation, automatic function execution without users’ interactions, crashes, and DoS attacks. Google has proposed various approaches to address this problem, e.g., case-by-case fixing the bugs or even proposing a blacklist to block all the non-SDK APIs. However, the developers can still figure out new ways of exploiting these hidden APIs to evade the non-SDKs restrictions. In this article, we systematically study the vulnerabilities due to the hidden API exploitation and analyze the effectiveness of Google’s countermeasures. We aim to answer if there are still vulnerable hidden APIs that can be exploited in newest Android 12. We develop a static analysis tool called\nServiceAudit\nto automatically mine the inconsistent security enforcement between service helper classes and the hidden service APIs. We apply\nServiceAudit\nto Android 6\n∼\n12. Our tool discovers 112 vulnerabilities in Android 6 with a higher precision than existing approaches. Moreover, in Android 11 and 12, we identify more than 25 hidden APIs with inconsistent protections; however, only one of the vulnerable APIs can lead to severe security problem in Android 11, and none of them work on Android 12.}

This article presents Paradise, a real-time, generalized, and distributed provenance-based intrusion detection method. Paradise introduces a novel extract strategy to prune and extract process feature vectors from provenance dependencies at the system log level, and it stores them in high-efficiency memory databases. Using this strategy, Paradise does not depend on the specific operating system type or provenance collection framework. Provenance-based dependencies are calculated independently during the detection phase, thus, Paradise can negotiate all detection results from multiple detectors without extra communication overhead between detectors. Paradise also employs an efficient load-balanced distribution scheme that enhances the Kafka architecture to efficiently distribute provenance graph feature vectors to the detectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has a high detection accuracy with a low time overhead.}

One key challenge in the design of NetHCF is to handle the restrictions stemmed from the limited computational model and memory resources of programmable switches. We address this by decomposing the HCF scheme into two complementary parts, by aggregating the IP-to-Hop-Count (IP2HC) mapping table for efficient memory usage, and by designing adaptive mechanisms to handle routing changes, IP popularity changes, and network activity dynamics. We implement an open-source prototype of NetHCF , and conduct extensive evaluations. The evaluation results demonstrate that NetHCF is able to process most legitimate traffic in 1\nμ\ns, filter spoofed IP traffic effectively under network dynamics, with less than 30% of switch resource occupation.}

	abstract = {Emerging IoT clouds are playing a more important role in modern lives, enabling users/developers to program applications to make better use of smart devices. However, preliminary research has shown IoT cloud vulnerabilities could expose IoT users to security risks. To better understand the problem, we studied the SmartThings cloud, one of the most popular IoT cloud platforms that support user-defined device automation (SmartApps). Specifically, we found new vulnerabilities in SmartThings that allow attackers to fake events to trigger the SmartApps to operate devices (e.g., open a lock). Exploiting such vulnerabilities, we successfully faked 7 different types of events, which impact 138 (out of 187) SmartThings’ official open-sourced SmartApps. To defeat such attacks, we propose an authenticity-verification-based scheme to deny fake events. Moreover, we designed a tool, SmartPatch , to help users secure their SmartThings systems. In specific, SmartPatch automatically patches the vulnerable SmartApps and Device Handlers (input) and outputs the flawless programs, which are ready for users to deploy in their SmartThings systems. We have made SmartPatch publicly available. With the help of SmartPatch , we patched all the vulnerable SmartThings’ official open-sourced programs (146 SmartApps and 321 Device Handlers). Experiments have shown the compatibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) excel in many tasks, the huge training resources they require become an obstacle for practitioners to develop their own models. It has become common to collect data from the Internet or hire a third party to train models. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that these operations provide a viable pathway for maliciously injecting hidden backdoors into DNNs. Several defense methods have been developed to detect malicious samples, with the common assumption that the latent representations of benign and malicious samples extracted by the infected model exhibit different distributions. However, it is still an open question whether this assumption holds up. In this article, we investigate such differences thoroughly via answering three questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the distributional differences? 2) How can they be effectively reduced? 3) What impact does this reduction have on difference-based defense methods? First, the distributional differences of multi-level representations on the regularly trained backdoored models are verified to be significant by adopting Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Energy Distance (ED), and Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) as the metrics. Then, ML-MMDR, a difference reduction method that adds multi-level MMD regularization into the loss, is proposed, and its effectiveness is testified on three typical difference-based defense methods. Across all the experimental settings, the F1 scores of these methods drop from 90%-100% on the regularly trained backdoored models to 60%-70% on the models trained with ML-MMDR. These results indicate that the proposed MMD regularization can enhance the stealthiness of existing backdoor attack methods. The prototype code of our method is now available at https://github.com/xpf/Multi-Level-MMD-Regularization .}

	abstract = {Mobile two-factor authentication (TFA), which uses mobile devices as a second security layer of protection to online accounts, has been widely applied with the proliferation of mobile phones. Currently, many studies propose to use acoustic fingerprints as the second factor. However, these solutions ignore the variations of the extracted static acoustic fingerprints incurred by the acoustic propagation process, which we show can be leveraged to develop an enhanced man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to compromise the security strength of these systems, while hiding the traces of the attacking devices. To address this newly-uncovered vulnerability, we propose SoundID, a secure and novel authentication system that introduces a dual challenge-response design through the acoustic signals of the enrolled phone and the login device. Specifically, the enrolled phone first evaluates its proximity to the login device by the similarity of their audio recordings, and then the login authentication server compares the calculated dynamic acoustic fingerprint with the one received from the enrolled phone. To the best of our knowledge, SoundID is the first scheme that extracts dynamic acoustic fingerprints and can effectively defend against the enhanced MITM attack. SoundID combines the benefits of unpredictable influencing factors of acoustic propagation processes and the stable frequency response of the acoustic hardware, whose high complexity prevents attackers from predicting or impersonating them. We build a prototype of SoundID with off-the-shelf smartphones to validate its robustness and effectiveness. Our results show that SoundID is user-friendly and achieves over 96.62% accuracy with an equal error rate around 4.27%.}

	abstract = {Voice authentication has been increasingly adopted for sensitive operations on mobile devices. While voice biometrics can distinguish individuals by their spectral features (such as voiceprints), they are known to be prone to spoofing attacks, where malicious attackers can use pre-recorded or synthesized samples from legitimate users or impersonate the speaking style of the targeted user to deceive the voice authentication system. In this paper, we design and implement a novel software-only anti-spoofing system on smartphones. Our system leverages the pop noise , which is generated by the user’s oral airflow when speaking the passphrase close to the microphone. The pop noise is delicate and subject to user diversity, making it hard to be recorded by replay attacks beyond a certain distance or to be imitated precisely by impersonators. Specifically, we design a new pop noise detection scheme to pinpoint pop noises at the phonemic level, based on which we establish a theoretical model to calculate the sound pressure level from the speech signal in order to get the estimated pressure signal, and then analyze the consistency with the actual pressure signal extracted from the pop noise. Furthermore, we calculate the similarity score of the unique sequences which describe the individually unique relationship between pop noises and phonemes to resist spoofing attacks. Our evaluation on a dataset of 30 participants and three smartphones shows that our system achieves over 94.79% accuracy. Our system requires no additional hardware and is robust to various factors including authentication angle, authentication distance, the length of passphrase, ambient noise, etc.}

	abstract = {With the ongoing revolutionary growth of the industrial Internet of Things and smart grid networks, smart grid (SG) communication has been acknowledged as a next-generation network for intelligent and efficient electric power transmission. In SG networks, smart meters (SMs) generally send requests for electricity demand to service providers (SPs), which deal with the requests for efficient energy distribution. However, SGs experience many security issues with the deployed SMs and untrusted wireless communication. To tackle these security issues, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication scheme for demand response management in SGs, called BPPS. It can resist various attacks and achieve secure mutual authentication with key agreement; moreover, it provides integrity of demand-response data using blockchain. Moreover, we perform the informal and formal (mathematical) security analysis to confirm that BPPS is secure against various attacks and achieves session key security, respectively. Furthermore, we conduct the performance and simulation analysis for SGs using NS3 and Ethereum testnet. Consequently, BPPS provides high-level security and can be applied to actual SG networks.}

In this article, we study the poisoning attacks on video recognition models. We reveal the major limitations of the state-of-the-art poisoning attacks on stealthiness and attack effectiveness : (i) the frame-by-frame poisoning trigger may cause temporal inconsistency among the video frames which can be leveraged to easily detect the attack; (ii) the feature collision-based method for crafting poisoned videos could lack both generalization and transferability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel stealthy and efficient poisoning attack framework which has the following advantages: (i) we design a 3D poisoning trigger as natural-like textures, which can maintain temporal consistency and human-imperceptibility; (ii) we formulate an ensemble attack oracle as the optimization objective to craft poisoned videos, which could construct convex polytope-like adversarial subspaces in the feature space and thus gain more generalization; (iii) our poisoning attack can be readily extended to the black-box setting with good transferability. We have experimentally validated the effectiveness of our attack (e.g., up to\n95%\nsuccess rates with only less than\n∼0.5%\npoisoned dataset).}

	abstract = {Based on the Threshold Predicate Encryption (TPE), the biometric authentication scheme PassBio aims to correctly authenticate genuine end-users without leaking their biometric privacy information. However, this article proposes two impersonation attacks to PassBio by merely sending very few query messages. Specifically, an attacker is able to cheat the authentication server with probability 50% by sending the server a random query, or almost 100% by sending the server a collusion of old genuine queries, without being identified. Moreover, in order to defeat the impersonation attacks, this article presents a Verifiable Threshold Predicate Encryption (VTPE) scheme which includes three components: (1) a multi-segment TPE for reducing the computational cost and communication overhead significantly; (2) a segment-wise watermarking for defeating the random attacks; and (3) a challenge-response mechanism for defeating the replay and collusion attacks. In addition, the watermarking also creates a secure channel between the querying user and the server. The experiments on both simulated feature vectors and real face images demonstrate that the present attacks and countermeasures are effective and efficient.}

Studying adversarial texts is an essential step to improve the robustness of NLP models. However, existing studies mainly focus on generating adversarial texts for English, with no prior knowledge that whether those attacks could be applied to Chinese. After analyzing the differences between Chinese and English, we propose a novel adversarial Chinese text generation solution Argot, by utilizing the method for adversarial English examples and several novel methods developed on Chinese characteristics. Argot could effectively and efficiently generate adversarial Chinese texts with good readability in both white-box and black-box settings. Argot could also automatically generate targeted Chinese adversarial texts, achieving a high success rate and ensuring the readability of the generated texts. Furthermore, we apply Argot to the spam detection task in both local detection models and a public toxic content detection system from a well-known security company. Argot achieves a relatively high bypass success rate with fluent readability, which proves that the real-world toxic content detection system is vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. We also evaluate some available defense strategies, and the results indicate that Argot can still achieve high attack success rates.}

However, in vehicular networks, how to evaluate the reliability of sensing vehicles and achieve lightweight privacy preservation are urgent issues. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight privacy preservation scheme with efficient reputation management (PPRM) for MCS in vehicular networks. Specifically, we design a lightweight privacy-preserving sensing task matching algorithm which can preserve location privacy, identity privacy, sensing data privacy, and reputation value privacy while reducing computation and communication overheads of sensing vehicles. In particular, to prevent reputation values from being forged and select reliable sensing vehicles, we present a privacy-preserving reputation value equality verification algorithm to verify reputation values and a privacy-preserving reputation value range proof algorithm to select reliable sensing vehicles. Afterwards, a three-factor reputation value update algorithm is constructed to efficiently and accurately update the reputation values for sensing vehicles. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the PPRM scheme, and the results show that the PPRM scheme significantly outperforms the existing schemes in security and robustness aspects.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used as the critical component of applications, bringing high computational costs. Many practitioners host their models on third-party platforms. This practice exposes DNNs to risks: A third party hosting the model may use a malicious deep learning framework to implement a backdoor attack. Our goal is to develop the realistic potential for backdoor attacks in third-party hosting platforms. We introduce a threatening and realistically implementable backdoor attack that is highly stealthy and flexible. We inject trojans by hijacking the built-in functions of the deep learning framework. Existing backdoor attacks rely on poisoning; its trigger is a special pattern superimposed on the input. Unlike existing backdoor attacks, the proposed sequential trigger is a specific sequence of clean image sets. Moreover, our attack is model agnostic and does not require retraining the model or modifying the parameters. Its stealthy is that injecting trojans will not change the model’s prediction for a clean image, so existing backdoor defenses cannot detect it. Its flexibility lies in that adversary can remodify the trojan behavior at any time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with different frameworks demonstrate that our attack achieves a perfect success rate (up to 100%) with minimal damage to model performance. And we can inject multiple trojans which do not affect each other at the same time, trojans hidden in the framework make a universal backdoor attack possible. Analysis and experiments further show that state-of-the-art defenses are ineffective against our attacks. Our work suggests that backdoor attacks in the supply chain need to be urgently explored.}

	abstract = {Wireless broadcast transmission enables Inter-vehicle or Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication among nearby vehicles. This communication supports latency-critical applications for improved safety and maybe optimized traffic. However, V2V communication is vulnerable to cyber attacks involving message manipulation. Mechanisms are required to ensure both authenticity and integrity of broadcast data, while maintaining drivers privacy against surveillance. Considering the limited computational resources of vehicles and the possibility of high traffic density scenarios, authentication processes should have low computational overhead. Prior research has produced multiple authentication protocol proposals based on digital signatures, hash functions, or Message Authentication Codes (MACs). To date, there is no computationally efficient secure broadcast authentication scheme tolerable by the vehicles resource-constrained On-Board Units (OBUs) for latency-critical applications in heavy traffic conditions. This paper provides a new secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving scheme proposing Anonymous Lightweight Inter-vehicle (ALI) broadcast authentication with encryption. ALI provides a high level of anonymity by combining a message authentication scheme with beacon encryption. The cryptographic overhead for V2V communication in the ALI scheme is only 149 bytes, and can handle authentication of approximately 700 broadcast messages every 100 milliseconds (ms) on a 2.10 Gigahertz (GHz) Intel Core 2 Duo Processor. This demonstrates the suitability of the ALI scheme in heavy traffic scenarios. We show the security and efficiency of our proposal by conducting both a formal security proof and extensive performance analysis.}

Blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (BCPPA) is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff among anonymity, traceability and key/certificate management in VANETs. Existing BCPPA protocols mitigate these security and privacy challenges by adding a significant cost on verification and traceability. As a result, current solutions fail to meet high mobility, low latency, and real-time requirements of VANETs. In this article, we design three new system building blocks namely key derivation (KeyDer), signatures of knowledge (SoK) and smart contract, following by a more efficient BCPPA protocol (named as EBCPA). To show the advantage of EBCPA, we first demonstrate it can satisfy the necessary requirements (e.g., message authentication, conditional privacy protection, resilience to common attacks, and so forth). Moreover, we implement the EBCPA in the on-line Ethereum test network (Rinkeby), Hyperledger test network and VANETs simulation environment (via VanetMobiSim and NS-2). Finally, we evaluate its communication overhead and computational cost via comparing to existing BCPPA protocols that strive to achieve similar properties. From the implementation and comparison results, our proposal can improve efficiency by reducing the time cost of traceability at least 48.95% and verification at least 42.21%.}

	abstract = {The dissemination of digital disinformation in online social networks (OSNs) has been the subject of extensive research, although many challenges remain, including the analysis and control of disinformation dissemination across different platforms (i.e., cross-platform). In this article, we investigate and analyze the spreading patterns and regularities of disinformation both within a single platform and across platforms. To explore the complex relationship between user propagation desire and behaviour within the same group, a user propagation desire inference model based on propagation characteristics (behaviour characteristics and time characteristics) and a bidirectional backpropagation (B-BP) deep neural network are constructed. Then, to avoid overfitting due to the interaction of users’ propagation behaviour and the correlation among propagation characteristics, a novel adaptive weighted particle swarm optimization evolutionary algorithm is utilized to further optimize the B-BP deep neural network. We design and conduct a series of evaluation experiments on the current global hot topics including but not limited to novel coronavirus-19 pandemic (COVID-19), food safety, medical and health, and environmental protection. By using a real-world social platform and its social situation metadata analysis, the experimental results show that the proposed method not only accurately predicts the level of user propagation desire under multiple behaviour interactions but also facilitates social platform managers in handling disinformation disseminators. Our findings reveal that the intensity of social users’ desires to spread disinformation is related to the topics and groups that users are interested in, while the propagation motivation of social users is not strong under topics that users are not interested in. Our studies also demonstrate that social users with propagation desires tend to utilize their familiar social platforms and local circles for communication, and the behaviour and desire to spread disinformation to the cross-platform are not strong. We posit that these findings can help inform online and, fine-grained governance and mitigation strategies other than “one size fits all” approaches (e.g., “account prohibition and deletion”), and hopefully minimize disinformation dissemination.}

	abstract = {Permission checks play an essential role in operating system security by providing access control to privileged functionalities. However, it is challenging for kernel developers to scalably verify the soundness of existing checks due to the large codebase and complexity of the kernel. In fact, Linux kernel contains millions of lines of code with hundreds of permission checks, and even worse, its complexity is fast-growing. This paper presents PeX, a static Pe rmission check error detector for Linu X , which takes as input a kernel source code and reports any missing, inconsistent, and redundant permission checks. PeX uses KIRIN (Kernel InteRface based Indirect call aNalysis), a novel, precise, and scalable indirect call analysis technique. Over the interprocedural control flow graph built by KIRIN, PeX automatically identifies permission checks and infers the mappings between permission checks and privileged functions. For each privileged function, PeX examines all possible paths to the function to check if necessary permission checks are correctly enforced. We evaluated PeX on the latest stable Linux kernel v4.18.5 for three types of permission checks: Discretionary Access Controls (DAC), Capabilities, and Linux Security Modules (LSM). PeX reported 45 new permission check errors, 17 of which have been confirmed by the kernel developers.}

	abstract = {To resolve the distortion resulting from the mismatch between the interval partition and the watermark distribution in the reversible watermarking based on difference expansion, an investigation is made to difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning. It is found that the conventional floating number-based methods with uniform interval partitioning are not fully considering different watermark distributions, and the embedding distortion can be optimized. Thus, a reversible watermarking based on difference expansion with adaptive interval partitioning is put forward for 2D engineering graphics. Each interval is adaptively partitioned into\n2\ns\nsub-intervals, and the watermark is embedded via transforming the positions of the vertices to its corresponding sub-intervals. The watermark extraction is accomplished by acquiring the indices of the sub-intervals of the watermarked vertices, and the graphics recovery is achieved by moving the watermarked vertices to the reverse direction. Moreover, a new polar coordinate system is built to be invariant to overall geometric transformation and vertices rearrangement. Experimental results and analysis indicate that it maintains good authentication ability and semi-fragility. Furthermore, its imperceptibility is significantly improved compared with the existing watermarking schemes under the same experimental conditions.}

	abstract = {Adversarial training (AT) is a typical method to learn adversarially robust deep neural networks via training on the adversarial variants generated by their natural examples. However, as training progresses, the training data becomes less attackable , which may undermine the enhancement of model robustness. A straightforward remedy is to incorporate more training data, but it may incur an unaffordable cost. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose a deCisiOn bounDary-aware data Augmentation framework (CODA): in each epoch, the CODA directly employs the meta information of the previous epoch to guide the augmentation process and generate more data that are close to the decision boundary, i.e., attackable data. Compared with the vanilla mixup , our proposed CODA can provide a higher ratio of attackable data, which is beneficial to enhance model robustness; it meanwhile mitigates the model's linear behavior between classes, where the linear behavior is favorable to the standard training for generalization but not to the adversarial training for robustness . As a result, our proposed CODA encourages the model to predict invariantly in the cluster of each class. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed CODA can indeed enhance adversarial robustness across various adversarial training methods and multiple datasets.}

	abstract = {Neural network implementations are known to be vulnerable to physical attack vectors such as fault injection attacks. As of now, these attacks were only utilized during the inference phase with the intention to cause a misclassification. In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm by injecting faults during the training phase of a neural network in a way that the resulting network can be attacked during deployment without the necessity of further faulting. In particular, we discuss attacks against ReLU activation functions that make it possible to generate a family of malicious inputs, which are called fooling inputs, to be used at inference time to induce controlled misclassifications. Such malicious inputs are obtained by mathematically solving a system of linear equations that would cause a particular behaviour on the attacked activation functions, similar to the one induced in training through faulting. We call such attacks fooling backdoor s as the fault attacks at training phase inject backdoors into the network that allow an attacker to produce fooling inputs. We evaluate our approach against multi-layer perceptron networks and convolutional networks on a popular image classification task obtaining high attack success rates (from 60% to 100%) and high classification confidence when as little as 25 neurons are attacked, while preserving high accuracy on the originally intended classification task.}

	abstract = {Protecting against multi-step attacks of uncertain start times and duration forces the defenders into indefinite, always ongoing, resource-intensive response. To allocate resources effectively, the defender must analyze and respond to an uncertain stream of potentially undetected multiple multi-step attacks and take measures of attack and response intensity over time into account. Such response requires estimation of overall attack success metrics and evaluating effect of defender strategies and actions associated with specific attack steps on overall attack metrics. We present a novel game-theoretic approach GPLADD to attack metrics estimation and demonstrate it on attack data derived from MITRE’s ATT&CK Framework and other sources. In GPLADD, the time to complete attack steps is explicit; the attack dynamics emerges from attack graph and attacker-defender capabilities and strategies and therefore reflects “physics” of attacks. The time the attacker takes to complete an attack step is drawn from a probability distribution determined by attacker and defender strategies and capabilities. This makes time a physical constraint on attack success parameters and enables comparing different defender resource allocation strategies across different attacks. We solve for attack success metrics by approximating attacker-defender games as discrete-time Markov chains and show evaluation of return on detection investments associated with different attack steps. We apply GPLADD to MITRE’s APT3 data from ATT&CK Framework and show that there are substantial and un-intuitive differences in estimated real-world vendor performance against a simplified APT3 attack. We focus on metrics that reflect attack difficulty versus attacker ability to remain hidden in the system after gaining control. This enables practical defender optimization and resource allocation against multi-step attacks.}

	abstract = {In the current digital world, face analytic systems become an integral part of daily life. However, today's cutting-edge technology and readily available social media information make these systems vulnerable through face spoofing attacks. These attacks can be mitigated using remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG), which remotely detects cardiovascular signals. Unfortunately, the illumination variation and face deformations can easily corrupt the pulse signals and thereby degrade the performance of rPPG-based anti-spoofing methods, even when longer-duration face videos are employed. This paper proposes a face anti-spoofing method\nSUNRISE\n, that is, S hort videos U si N g p R e-empt I ve S plit and m E rge. It is an rPPG-based face anti-spoofing for short duration videos wherein facial deformations are removed by introducing the split and merge mechanism. It splits the video into several clips, provides low importance to the clips containing facial deformations, and eventually merges the results using quality-based fusion. The efficacy of existing rPPG-based methods is limited because they employed high dimensional features for training using the limited training data. We mitigate this limitation by utilizing the statistical features of clips. The experimental results on publicly available datasets reveal that the proposed method exhibits significantly better performance than the well-known existing methods for a short time duration.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is increasingly popular, as it allows us to circumvent challenges due to data islands (e.g., challenges in getting access to raw datasets, particularly when data are owned by multiple data owners) by training a global model using data from one or more data owners / sources. However, in an edge computing deployment one cannot assume that resource-constrained end devices are sufficiently secure. In other words, we have to consider the possibility of these devices being compromised and can be abused to facilitate poisoning attacks. Privacy-preserving is another important property to consider when dealing with sensitive user data on end devices. Most existing approaches only consider either defending against poisoning attacks or supporting privacy, but not both properties simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a differentially private federated learning model against poisoning attacks, designed for edge computing deployment. First, we design a weight-based algorithm to perform anomaly detection on the parameters uploaded by end devices in edge nodes, which improves detection rate using only small-size validation datasets and minimizes the communication cost. Then, differential privacy technology is leveraged to protect the privacy of both data and model in an edge computing setting. We also evaluate the detection performance in the presence of random and customized malicious end devices, and compare its performance with those of two other competing approaches published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing , in terms of attack resiliency, and communication and computation costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve an optimal tradeoff between security, efficiency and accuracy.}

In this article, we propose SEIMI , a highly efficient intra-process memory isolation technique for memory-corruption defenses. The core is to use the efficient Supervisor-mode Access Prevention (SMAP) , a hardware feature that is originally used for preventing the kernel from accessing the user space, to achieve intra-process memory isolation. To leverage SMAP, SEIMI creatively executes the user code in the privileged mode. In addition to enabling the new design of the SMAP-based memory isolation, we further develop multiple new techniques to ensure secure escalation of user code. Extensive experiments show that SEIMI outperforms existing isolation mechanisms, including the Memory Protection Keys (MPK) based scheme and the Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) based scheme.}

	abstract = {Bipartite graphs have been widely adopted in applications such as e-healthcare and recommendation systems thanks to their ability to model various real-world relationships. Meanwhile,\n(α,β)\n-core query services over bipartite graphs are generally recognized as a promising approach for finding communities, i.e., sets of closely related vertices, in a bipartite graph. As the bipartite graph grows, the service providers tend to outsource the services to the cloud for flexible and highly reliable computational resources. However, since the cloud is not fully trustable, there are privacy concerns related to the dataset, query requests, and results. Although many schemes have been proposed for privacy-preserving queries over graphs, they cannot be directly adopted to handle accurate\n(α,β)\n-core queries over bipartite graphs. Aiming at the challenges, under the two-server setting, this paper constructs two privacy-preserving schemes with different levels of security to handle\n(α,β)\n-core queries over the bipartite graph. Specifically, in the proposed schemes, a graph is represented as an index containing an edge table and a node table and further encrypted by a symmetric homomorphic encryption scheme, and then the two servers securely traverse the index. Detailed security analysis shows that both schemes can achieve access pattern privacy, while the security-enhanced one can further protect the structure privacy of the query requests and results. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are conducted, and the results also indicate our proposed schemes are computationally efficient.}

	abstract = {This article explores the calibration of a classifier output score in binary classification problems. A calibrator is a function that maps the arbitrary classifier score, of a testing observation, onto [0,1] to provide an estimate for the posterior probability of belonging to one of the two classes. Calibration is important for two reasons; first, it provides a meaningful score, that is the posterior probability; second, it puts the scores of different classifiers on the same scale for comparable interpretation. The article presents three main contributions: (1) Introducing multi-score calibration, when more than one classifier provides a score for a single observation. (2) Introducing the exact analogy between two scenarios: (a) designing a classifier from a set of features, and (b) designing a calibrator, to generate a single calibrated score, from a set of scores of different classifiers. Hence, we propose expanding these classifiers’ scores to higher dimensions to boost the calibrator’s performance. (3) Conducting a massive simulation study, in the order of 24,000 experiments, that incorporates different configurations, in addition to experimenting on three real datasets from the cybersecurity domain. The results show that there is no overall winner among the different calibrators and different configurations. However, general advices for practitioners include the following: the Platt’s calibrator (J. Platt et al. , 1999), a version of the logistic regression that decreases bias for a small sample size, has a very stable and acceptable performance among all experiments; our suggested multi-score calibration provides better performance than single score calibration in the majority of experiments, including the two real datasets. In addition, expanding the scores can help in some experiments.}

	abstract = {Recent development of smart cities includes advanced and optimized use of modern smart grid (SG) than the traditional power grid. The paradigm of SG has also transformed houses into a home area networks, where several smart devices and appliances are connected to the electricity control centers (ECC). Appliances share their load and consumption related information to ECC through smart meters. This consumption data may be used for supply-demand management, for example, by ramping production up or down as needed. However, security and privacy of the consumer's data are greatly important since fine-grained smart meter data may reveal users presence/absence in their house. To address this issue, several public-key-based or identity-based data aggregation schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, most of such schemes either suffer from the complexity of certificate management or key escrow problem. To eliminate these issues, in this paper, we propose an efficient certificate-based data aggregation (CB-DA) scheme. In the proposed CB-DA scheme, the owner selects a secret key and then use the secret key along with certificates as decryption/signing keys. Our analysis shows that the proposed CB-DA is secure under the random oracle model and more efficient than the existing data aggregation schemes.}

	abstract = {Machine learning has shown promise for improving the accuracy of Android malware detection in the literature. However, it is challenging to (1) stay robust towards real-world scenarios and (2) provide interpretable explanations for experts to analyse. In this article, we propose MsDroid , an An droid malware detection system that makes decisions by identifying m alicious s nippets with interpretable explanations. We mimic a common practice of security analysts, i.e., filtering APIs before looking through each method, to focus on local snippets around sensitive APIs instead of the whole program. Each snippet is represented with a graph encoding both code attributes and domain knowledge and then classified by Graph Neural Network (GNN). The local perspective helps the GNN classifier to concentrate on code highly correlated with malicious behaviors, and the information contained in graphs benefit in better understanding of the behaviors. Hence, MsDroid is more robust and interpretable in nature. To identify malicious snippets, we present a semi-supervised learning approach that only requires app labeling. The key insight is that malicious snippets only exist in malwares and appear at least once in a malware. To make malicious snippets less opaque, we design an explanation mechanism to show the importance of control flows and to retrieve similarly implemented snippets from known malwares. A comprehensive comparison with 5 baseline methods is conducted on a dataset of more than 81K apps in 3 real-world scenarios, including zero-day , evolution , and obfuscation . The experimental results show that MsDroid is more robust than state-of-the-art systems in all cases, with 5.37% to 49.52% advantage in F1-score. Besides, we demonstrate that the provided explanations are effective and illustrate how the explanations facilitate malware analysis.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming every corner of our daily life and plays important roles in the smart home. Depending on different requirements on wireless transmission, dedicated wireless protocols have been adopted on various types of IoT devices. Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) enable direct communication across those wireless protocols, which will greatly improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. However, it incurs serious security concerns on heterogeneous IoT devices. In this paper, we identify a new physical-layer attack, cross-technology signal emulation attack, where a WiFi device eavesdrops a ZigBee packet on the fly, and further manipulates the ZigBee device by emulating a ZigBee signal. To defend against this attack, we propose two defense strategies with the help of an anchor. Particularly, the passive defense strategy focuses on misleading the ZigBee signal eavesdropping, while the proactive approach develops a real-time detection mechanism on distinguishing between a common ZigBee signal and an emulated signal. We implement the complete attacking process and defense strategies with TI CC26x2R LaunchPad, USRP-N210 platform, and smart LED light bulbs, as well as a self-designed prototype, where a general light bulb can be turned on/off by a Nexus 5 smartphone directly. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the existence of the attack, and the feasibility, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed defense strategies.}

	abstract = {Face recognition has been extensively employed in practice, such as attendance system and public security. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm is one of the most significant ones in the field of face recognition, but it is very difficult for many clients to employ it in their resource-constrained devices (e.g., smartphones and notebook computers). Outsourcing computation provides a promising method for clients to perform heavy tasks with limited computing power. In this paper, we design a protocol of outsourcing LDA-based face recognition to an untrusted cloud, which can help the client to complete the operations of matrix inversion (MI), matrix multiplication (MM) and eigenvalue decomposition (ED) simultaneously. The proposed outsourcing protocol can hide the private data of the client from the cloud. More importantly, the client can verify whether the outsourcing results are correct or not with probability one and so it is impossible for the server to deceive the client. In addition, the proposed protocol greatly decreases the computational complexity of the client thus enabling the client to complete LDA algorithm efficiently. Finally, we implement the protocol and give a comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that the client obtain great computing savings and the face recognition accuracy in the proposed protocol is almost identical to the original LDA algorithm.}

	abstract = {Data outsourcing is a promising technical paradigm to facilitate cost-effective real-time data storage, processing, and dissemination. In data outsourcing, a data owner proactively pushes a stream of data records to a third-party cloud server for storage, which in turn processes various types of queries from end users on the data owner’s behalf. However, the popular outsourced multi-version key-value stores pose a critical security challenge that a third-party cloud server cannot be fully trusted to return both authentic and fresh data in response to end users’ queries. Although several recent attempts have been made on authenticating data freshness in outsourced key-value stores, they either incur excessively high communication cost or can only offer very limited real-time guarantee. To fill this gap, this article introduces KV-Fresh, a novel freshness authentication scheme for outsourced key-value stores that offers strong real-time guarantee for both point query and range query. KV-Fresh is designed based on a novel data structure, Linked Key Span Merkle Hash Tree, which enables highly efficient freshness proof by embedding chaining relationship among records generated at different time. Extensive simulation studies using a synthetic dataset generated from real data confirm the efficacy and efficiency of KV-Fresh.}

	abstract = {We address least-privilege in a particular context of public cloud computing: calls to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). AWS is, by far, the largest cloud provider, and therefore an important context in which to consider the fundamental security design principle of least-privilege, which states that a thread of execution should possess only those privileges it needs. There have been reports of over-privilege being a root cause of attacks against AWS cloud applications, and a least-privilege set for an API call is a necessary building-block in devising a least-privilege policy for a cloud application. We observe that accurate information on a least-privilege set for an invoker of a method to possess is simply not available for most such methods in AWS. We provide a meaningful characterization of least-privilege in this context. We then propose techniques to determine such sets, and discuss a black-box process we have devised and carried out to identify such sets for all 707 API methods we are able to invoke across five AWS services. We discuss a number of interesting discoveries we have made, some of which are surprising and some alarming, that we have reported to AWS. Our work has resulted in a database of least-privilege sets for API calls to AWS, which we make available publicly. Developers can consult our database when configuring security policies for their cloud applications, and we welcome contributors that augment our database. Also, we discuss example uses of our database via an assessment of two repositories and two full-fledged serverless applications that are available publicly and have policies published alongside. We observe that the vast majority of policies are over-privileged. Our work contributes constructively to securing cloud applications in the largest cloud provider.}

	abstract = {The advances in Internet of Things, Big Data, and machine learning technologies have greatly transformed our daily lives into much more intelligent ones by offering various promising services. Among those services, the discrete Fréchet distance (DFD) range query, which aims to obtain a set of trajectories whose distances to a given query trajectory do not exceed a given threshold, has been widely applied to support applications such as vehicle trajectory clustering and other data processing tasks. Meanwhile, due to the huge data volume issue in the Big Data era, there is a trend towards outsourcing various query services to the cloud for achieving a better performance. However, since the cloud is not fully trustable, designing privacy-preserving query services becomes a research focus. Over the past years, many schemes focusing on privacy-preserving trajectory analysis have been proposed, but none of them can well support privacy-preserving DFD range queries. Aiming at addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving DFD range query scheme, in which queries are conducted in a filtration-and-verification manner and the privacy of the dataset and queries can be preserved. Specifically, by indexing the dataset with two R-trees, a query can be conducted by i) querying the two R-trees to obtain a candidate set and ii) verifying each trajectory in the set, which involve two basic operations, namely, rectangle intersection detection and proximity detection. To preserve the privacy of the dataset and queries, we build the two basic operations upon a novel Inner-Product Preserving Encryption (IPPE) scheme, which is proved to be selectively secure with trivial leakages. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce the computational cost by effectively reducing the candidate set’s size.}

	abstract = {Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) is a practical cryptographic primitive that assists servers to provide search and update functionalities in the ciphertext domain. Recent work on DSSE schemes has focused on the direction of forward-privacy, requiring that newly added files cannot be linked to previously query results. However, due to the complexity of forward-privacy updates, existing schemes can only address an honest-but-curious server. It is difficult to verify updated results while preserving forward-privacy. In this paper, we explore how blockchain techniques can help us achieve a verifiable and forward-privacy DSSE scheme. Our scheme resorts to the emerging smart contract as a trusted platform to store digests for public result verification, and carefully crafts dynamic query protocols to enable encrypted search with forward-privacy. In our design, indexes are collocated with encrypted files and stored at storage-servers, which makes the blockchain light-weighted and search operations more efficient. Moreover, we propose a hybrid index design to support efficient files deletion. By using our blockchain-assisted primitive, the property collision between dynamic result verification and forward-privacy can be solved. We formally analyze the security strengths and provide the prototype implementation on Ethereum. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and usability of our blockchain-assisted DSSE scheme.}

	abstract = {As the demand for Internet of Things (IoT) technologies continues to grow, IoT devices have been viable targets for malware infections. Although deep learning-based malware detection has achieved great success, the detection models are usually trained based on the collected user records, thereby leading to significant privacy risks. One promising solution is to leverage federated learning (FL) to enable distributed on-device training without centralizing the private user records. However, it is non-trivial for IoT users to label these records, where the quality and the trustworthiness of data labeling are hard to guarantee. To address the above issues, this paper develops a semi-supervised federated IoT malware detection framework based on knowledge transfer technologies, named by FedMalDE. Specifically, FedMalDE explores the underlying correlation between labeled and unlabeled records to infer labels towards unlabeled samples by the knowledge transfer mechanism. Moreover, a specially designed subgraph aggregated capsule network (SACN) is used to efficiently capture varied malicious behaviors. The extensive experiments conducted on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMalDE in detecting IoT malware and its sufficient privacy and robustness guarantee.}

	abstract = {The success of machine learning (ML) depends on the availability of large-scale datasets. However, recent studies have shown that models trained on such datasets are vulnerable to privacy attacks, among which membership inference attack (MIA) brings serious privacy risk. MIA allows an adversary to infer whether a sample belongs to the training dataset of the target model or not. Though a variety of defenses against MIA have been proposed such as differential privacy and adversarial regularization, they also result in lower model accuracy and thus make the models less unusable. In this article, aiming at maintaining the accuracy while protecting the privacy against MIA, we propose a new defense against membership inference attacks by generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, sensitive data is used to train a GAN, then the GAN generate the data for training the actual model. To ensure that the model trained with GAN on small datasets can has high utility, two different GAN structures with special training techniques are utilized to deal with the image data and table data, respectively. Experiment results show that the defense is more effective on different data sets against the existing attack schemes, and is more efficient compared with most advanced MIA defenses.}

However, collecting a large amount of sensitive personal information is a challenging task. In addition, this information may have missing values, which are not considered in the existing methods for collecting personal information while ensuring data privacy. Failure to account for missing values reduces the accuracy of the data analysis. In this article, we propose a method for privacy-preserving data collection that considers many missing values. The patient data are anonymized and sent to a data collection server. The data collection server creates a generative model and a contingency table suitable for multi-attribute analysis based on expectation–maximization and Gaussian copula methods. Using differential privacy (the de facto standard) as a privacy metric, we conduct experiments on synthetic and real data, including COVID-19-related data. The results are 50–80% more accurate than those of existing methods that do not consider missing values.}

In this article, we first prove that it is impossible to devise a safe self - or snap-stabilizing broadcast algorithm. We then propose the first self- and snap-stabilizing broadcast algorithm with the propagation 1-safety and the propagation reliability properties. Starting in an arbitrary initial configuration or after a fault, our proposed algorithm implements propagation 1-safety ensuring that a spurious message , a message that did not originate from the legitimate root process, can be sent by a process to its neighbors, however, it cannot be forwarded further. In addition, the propagation reliability property of the proposed algorithm ensures that a legitimate message reaches all system processes exactly once.}

However, TLC NAND flash memory could have the reliability problem (such as the retention errors and the read disturb errors), as the cell capacity increases. Because the reasons of the retention errors and the read disturb errors are due to 8 different states in a TLC cell, we will propose a method to coordinate the retention errors, the read disturb errors and the Huffman coding on TLC NAND flash memory by removing some unsuitable states when different data accesses are considered. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can utilize the compression of the Huffman coding to improve the performance.

	abstract = {The rapid development of IoT (Internet of Things) brings great convenience to people through the utilization of IoT applications, but also brings huge security challenges. Existing IoT security breaches show that many IoT devices have authentication flaws. Although many IoT authentication schemes were proposed, they are not fit for recent smart IoT applications covering IoT device, back-end sever, and user-end mobile applications. To build the first line of defense for smart IoT systems, this paper proposes a new authentication scheme. The proposed scheme first models the entire lifecycle of the IoT device authentication for real-world scenarios of smart IoT systems that contains factory manufacturing, daily usage, and system resetting. For each stage in the lifecycle, the proposed scheme employs efficient symmetric key mechanisms to achieve the authentication between IoT device, back-end server, and mobile application. The proposed scheme supports both server-free local area network communication and sever-involved remote public area communication. Formal security verification shows that the proposed scheme resists existing attacks. The open-source experimental evaluations also show that the proposed scheme is efficient and promising for practical usage.}

	abstract = {Behaviour analysis is essential for the security verification of suspicious Android applications, but analysts are usually faced with a huge obstacle when conducting the app behaviour analysis. They are expected to have comprehensive knowledge of different IT fields and a strong awareness of cyber threats. However, training a new security analyst typically requires a significant amount of time and can be extremely costly. Although there are tools available to assist analysts in studying Android behaviour and security, the completion of this task still heavily relies on the experience of the analysts. To address this problem, we recognise visualisation as a promising method and conduct a series of controlled experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of Android app behaviour and security analysis. We accordingly develop a visualisation tool based on apps’ call graphs (CG) (named VisualDroid ) and conduct an experiment and a follow-up interview. Compared to existing solutions, the results suggest that the CG-based visualisation solution ( VisualDroid ) can lower the barriers to Android behaviour and security analysis. The user study reveals that the platform includes CG-based visualisation components leads to a statistically significant improvement in Android behaviour analysis and security awareness. More specifically, it improves APK Analyzer , JD-GUI , JD-GUI+FlowDroid by 71.4%, 35.7%, and 39.2% in terms of the effectiveness of behaviour analysis. Participants who use VisualDroid also show improvements in the aspect of security awareness with an increase of 155% against APK Analyzer , 96% against JD-GUI , and 59.3% JD-GUI+FlowDroid .}

	abstract = {Callbacks are an essential mechanism for event-driven programming. Unfortunately, callbacks make reasoning challenging because they introduce behaviors where calls to the module are interleaved. We present a parametric method that, from a particular invariant of the program, allows reducing the problem of verifying the invariant in the presence of callbacks, to the callback-free setting. Intuitively, we allow callbacks to introduce behaviors that cannot be produced by callback free executions, as long as they do not affect correctness. A chief insight is that the user is aware of the potential effect of the callbacks on the program state. To this end, we present a parametric verification technique which accepts this insight as a relation between callback and callback free executions. We implemented our approach and applied it successfully to a large set of real-world programs.}

	abstract = {The Control Area Network (CAN) represents the standard bus for intra-vehicular networks communication. Unfortunately, CAN was not designed to be a secure protocol. Communications over CAN do not take advantage of any security feature (e.g., cryptography and authentication), raising different vulnerabilities in critical applications. This lack of security is even more emphasized in recent CAN networks, which integrate remote connection capabilities (e.g., Bluetooth and WiFi). This insecurity-by-design led to the development of specific mechanisms to patch CAN vulnerabilities. Many proposed solutions rely on implementing optimized cryptographic primitives and assume that the cryptographic keys were previously shared among the different nodes during the production phase, omitting the issue related to keys distribution and update. We propose SENECAN, a solution that combines watermarking and wired jamming to secure the CAN bus's long-term key distribution. Our solution leverages intentional interference and spread spectrum watermarking to achieve security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and anti-replay. Compared to other works, SENECAN does not require any CAN protocol and system architecture modification. Instead, it requires an additional CAN transceiver and an initial transmission overhead. Finally, we tested the effectiveness and functioning of the SENECAN distribution schema in a real CAN environment.}

We design and integrate two new techniques in SymmeProof, namely vector compression and inner-product range proof. The proposed vector compression is able to reduce the communication cost to\nlog(n)\nfor\nn\n-size vectors. The proposed inner-product range proof converts a range proof relation into an inner-product form, which can further reduce the range proof size with the vector compression technique. Based on these two techniques, SymmeProof can eventually achieve a\nlog(n)\n-size range proof. The proposed SymmeProof can be used in many important applications such as blockchain confidential transactions as well as arguments for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. We evaluate the performance of SymmeProof. The results show that SymmeProof substantially outperforms representative methods such as Bulletproofs in the proof size without a trusted setup.}

	abstract = {Increasingly, information systems rely on computational, storage, and network resources deployed in third-party facilities such as cloud centers and edge nodes. Such an approach further exacerbates cybersecurity concerns constantly raised by numerous incidents of security and privacy attacks resulting in data leakage and identity theft, among others. These have, in turn, forced the creation of stricter security and privacy-related regulations and have eroded the trust in cyberspace. In particular, security-related services and infrastructures, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs) that provide digital certificate services and Third-Party Authorities (TPAs) that provide cryptographic key services, are critical components for establishing trust in crypto-based privacy-preserving applications and services. To address such trust issues, various transparency frameworks and approaches have been recently proposed in the literature. This article proposes TAB framework that provides transparency and trustworthiness of third-party authority and third-party facilities using blockchain techniques for emerging crypto-based privacy-preserving applications. TAB employs the Ethereum blockchain as the underlying public ledger and also includes a novel smart contract to automate accountability with an incentive mechanism that motivates users to participate in auditing, and punishes unintentional or malicious behaviors. We implement TAB and show through experimental evaluation in the Ethereum official test network, Rinkeby, that the framework is efficient. We also formally show the security guarantee provided by TAB , and analyze the privacy guarantee and trustworthiness it provides.}

	abstract = {Behavioral biometrics has been widely investigated and deployed in real world scenarios for human authentication. However, there has been almost nil attempt to identify behavior patterns in a cross-scenario setting, which is common in practice and needs urgent attention. This paper defines and investigates cross-scenario behavioral biometrics authentication using keystroke dynamics. A novel system called CrossBehaAuth is presented for extending keystroke dynamics-based behavior authentication to new scenarios and extensive problems. We design a temporal-aware learning mechanism based deep neural network for cross-scenario keystroke dynamics authentication. This mechanism selectively learns and encodes temporal information for efficient behavioral pattern transfer in cross-scenario settings. A local Gaussian data augmentation approach is proposed to increase the diversity of behavioral data and therefore, further improve the performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets. The extensive experimental results confirm the efficacy of our CrossBehaAuth for cross-scenario keystroke dynamics authentication. Our approach significantly improves the authentication accuracy in cross-scenario settings and even achieves comparable performance on single-scenario authentication tasks. In addition, our approach shows its generalizability and advantages in both single and cross scenario keystroke dynamics authentication.}

When the cover images are similar, a number of relevant samples are provided to steganalysis, which is disadvantageous to steganography. This paper proposes a new cover selection method to joint image similarity and embedding distortion. Due to the difference between steganography and other image processing tasks, e.g., image reconstruction, image recognition, we propose a customized method to calculate image similarity for steganography based on SVD (singular value decomposition). Importantly, the small singular values (instead of the large ones) are employed, since it is suitable for the properties of steganography. In addition, embedding distortion is calculated by the current distortion minimization framework. The obtained image similarity and embedding distortion are combined to form a new cover selection strategy. As a result, the properties of batch images can be fully used. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art cover selection methods when they are checked by modern steganalytic tools.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has achieved huge success in recent years, but is also vulnerable to various attacks. In this article, we concentrate on membership inference attacks and propose Aster, which merely requires the target model's black-box API and a data sample to determine whether this sample was used to train the given ML model or not. The key idea of Aster is that the training data of a fully trained ML model usually has lower prediction sensitivities compared with that of the non-training data (i.e., testing data). Less sensitivity means that when perturbing a training sample's feature value in the corresponding feature space, the prediction of the perturbed sample obtained from the target model tends to be consistent with the original prediction. In this article, we quantify the prediction sensitivity with the Jacobian matrix which could reflect the relationship between each feature's perturbation and the corresponding prediction's change. Then we regard the samples with a lower as training data. Aster can breach the membership privacy of the target model's training data with no prior knowledge about the target model or its training data. The experiment results on four datasets show that our method outperforms three state-of-the-art inference attacks.}

	abstract = {The clustering algorithm is a useful tool for analyzing medical data. For instance, the k-means clustering can be used to study precipitating factors of a disease. In order to implement the clustering algorithm efficiently, data computation is outsourced to cloud servers, which may leak the private data. Encryption is a common method for solving this problem. But cloud servers are difficult to calculate ciphertexts from multiple parties. Hence, we choose multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which supports computations on the ciphertexts that have different secret keys, to protect the private data. In this paper, based on Chen's multi-key FHE scheme, we first propose secure squared euclidean, comparison, minimum, and average protocols. Then, we design the basic and advanced schemes for implementing the secure multi-party k-means clustering algorithm. In the basic scheme, the implementation of homomorphic multiplication includes the process of transforming ciphertexts under different keys. In order to implement homomorphic multiplication efficiently, the advanced scheme uses an improved method to transform ciphertexts. Meanwhile, almost all computations are completely outsourced to cloud servers. We prove that the proposed protocols and schemes are secure and feasible. Simulation results also show that our improved method is helpful for improving the homomorphic multiplication of Chen's multi-key FHE scheme.}

	abstract = {Lots of non-additive cost assignment methods designed for image steganography have improved the security of stego images, but surprisingly there are only a few such non-additive cost assignment methods for video steganography. In this article, we first analyze the distortion propagation by decomposing it into inner-block, inter-block, and inter-frame distortion drifts. Then, we determine the inner-block distortion drift (caused by the embedding modifications) that induces the inter-block and the inter-frame distortion drifts, using prediction. Based on the findings, we compose a joint distortion for all transform coefficients in each transform block. Finally, we propose a joint distortion-based non-additive cost assignment (NACA) method to reduce the inner-block distortion drift by distortion compensation. This allows us to further reduce both intra-frame (inter-block) and inter-frame distortion drifts, and achieve enhanced security. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of NACA, in terms of security and coding performance. The evaluation results demonstrate that NACA achieves improved security and visual stego video quality, and maintains a very marginal increase in bit-rate, in comparison to four other competing additive cost assignment approaches.}

	abstract = {The recent literature has shown that adversarial embedding has promise for enhancing the security of steganography. However, existing methods achieve the final stego mainly based on a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based steganalyzer without considering any other steganalytic features. When the steganalyzer is re-trained, its performance usually drops significantly. We propose a novel adversarial embedding method via stego generation and selection. To improve the diversity of the stego images, this method first randomly generates many candidate stegos according to the amplitudes of the gradients and embedding costs of a given cover. Since the image residuals are the commonly used low-level features in many steganalyzers, the proposed method carefully designs different adaptive high-pass filters to calculate the image residuals, and then selects a final stego from among those candidate stegos which can successfully fool the pre-trained steganalyzer, according to the residual distance between stego and the cover. Extensive experimental evaluations on re-trained CNN-based and traditional steganalyzers demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the security of the modern steganographic methods in both spatial and JPEG domains, and achieve much better performance than related adversarial embedding methods.}

We first propose an encryption mechanism for phenotype data, where each data owner is allowed to encrypt its data with a unique secret key. Moreover, the ciphertext supports privacy-preserving search and, consequently, enables the identification of the case and control groups for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) without any privacy violations. Furthermore, we provide a per-query based authorization mechanism for a client to access and operate on the data stored at the CSP. Additionally, we apply multi-key fully homomorphic encryption to encrypt genomic data and show how to compute GWAS statistics (e.g., chi-square distribution test) over the ciphertext of individuals in the identified case and control groups. Thus, for the first time, the proposed scheme provides privacy-preserving computation for the entire GWAS pipeline. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme and run experiments over a real-life genomic dataset to show its effectiveness. The result shows that the proposed solution is capable to efficiently identify the case/control groups and subsequently conduct GWAS on the identified case/control groups.}

	abstract = {J1939 is a networking layer built on top of the widespread CAN bus used for communication between different subsystems within a vehicle. The J1939 and NMEA 2000 protocols standardize data enrichment for these subsystems, and are used for trucks, weapon systems, naval vessels, and other industrial systems. Practical security solutions for existing CAN based communication systems are notoriously difficult because of the lack of cryptographic capabilities of the devices involved. In this paper we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) for J1939 and NMEA 2000 networks. Our IDS (CANDID) combines timing analysis with a packet manipulation detection system and data analysis. This data analysis enables us to capture the state of the vehicle, detect messages with irregular timing intervals, and take advantage of the dependencies between different Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to restrict even the most advanced attacker. Our IDS is deployed and tested on multiple vehicles, and has demonstrated greater accuracy and detection capabilities than previous work.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous model aggregation (HMA) is an effective paradigm that integrates on-device trained models heterogeneous in architecture and target task into a comprehensive model. Recent works adopt knowledge distillation to amalgamate the knowledge of learned features and predictions from heterogeneous on-device models to realize HMA. However, most of them ignore that the disclosure of learned features exposes on-device models to privacy attacks. Moreover, the aggregated model may suffer from the imbalanced supervision caused by the uneven distribution of amalgamated knowledge about each class and show class bias. In this article, to address these issues, we propose a response-based class-balanced heterogeneous model aggregation mechanism, called CBHMA. It can effectively achieve HMA in a privacy-preserving manner and alleviate class bias in the aggregated model. Specifically, CBHMA aggregates on-device models by using only their response information to reduce their privacy leakage risk. To mitigate the impact of imbalanced supervision, CBHMA quantitatively measures the imbalanced supervision level for each class. Based on that, CBHMA customizes fine-grained misclassification costs for each class and utilizes such costs to adjust the importance of each class (more importance to classes with weaker supervision) in the response-based HMA algorithm. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CBHMA.}

	abstract = {Location-based services have significantly affected mobile users’ everyday life, and location privacy has become essential. Some applications (e.g., location-based recommendation, mobility analytics) do not need the raw location data, and the service providers adopt aggregation to protect users’ location traces. However, some works show that even these aggregation data may disclose users’ location privacy when additional prior knowledge is available to an adversary. We consider the location privacy problem in the presence of Location Uniqueness , a property by which some geographical locations can be re-identified based on the aggregated point-of-interest information. We first study whether existing protection mechanisms are adequate for defending against this type of attack. Then we present two practical attacks for inferring users’ actual locations based on the POI aggregates. A secure POI aggregate release mechanism is proposed for defending against this type of re-identification attack and achieving differential privacy at the same time. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results show that the existing protection mechanisms cannot provide sufficient protection against location re-identification attacks. The proposed attacks can significantly improve the inference performance, and the proposed protection mechanism achieves satisfactory performance.}

	abstract = {Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author: Please provide index terms/keywords for your article. To download the IEEE Taxonomy go to http://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf ?> the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by Jia et al. 2017, and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by Celik et al. 2017, and achieved a 100% accuracy. Our experimental studies indicate that adopting CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.}

	abstract = {Data deduplication is of critical importance to reduce the storage cost for clients and to relieve the unnecessary storage pressure for cloud servers. While various techniques have been proposed for secure deduplication of identical files/blocks, the effective and secure deduplication solutions on fuzzy similar data (image, video, and others) which occupy a large portion in the real world across wide applications, remain open. In this article, we propose a novel deduplication system, named Fuzzy Deduplication (FuzzyDedup), to implement the secure deduplication of similar data (i.e., similar files, chunks, or blocks). In particular, we leverage the similarity-preserving hash, a fuzzy extractor based on error-correcting codes, and the encryption with customized design to construct a fuzzy-style deduplication encryption scheme (FuzzyMLE), achieving the ciphertext-based deduplication for similar data. Besides, to defend against data ownership cheating attack and duplicate-faking attack, a fuzzy-style proof of ownership scheme (FuzzyPoW) is designed for the cloud server to securely verify a client in possession of the similar data. To further enhance security and efficiency, we also propose both server-aided and random-tag FuzzyMLE to make FuzzyDedup robust against off-line brute-force attack and to support tag randomization, respectively. Then, we design Hamming distance reduction and tag cutting optimization algorithms to improve the tag query efficiency of FuzzyDedup. In the end, we formally prove the security of our solution and conduct experiments on real-world datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results exhibit the efficiency of FuzzyDedup in terms of computation cost and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides a new paradigm to offer flexible IT infrastructures. In IaaS clouds, tenants deploy software-defined networking (SDN) policies to simplify network management and customize network behaviors. However, programming SDN networks is error-prone no matter using low-level APIs or high-level programming languages. Specifically, SDN policies may contain misconfigurations that do not break the pre-defined network invariants (e.g., black holes), but either degrade the deployment efficiency or mistakenly translate tenants intents. Prior studies for checking either traditional access control policies or network-wide invariants, are thus fail to detect these misconfigurations. To address this gap, this paper presents PMM, a misconfiguration checking tool for compositional SDN that works at the data plane of cloud networks. We first propose a new data structure, minimal interval set, to represent the match patterns of rulesets. This representation serves the basis for composition algebra construction and misconfiguration checking. We then propose the principles, algorithms and also optimisations for fast and accurate checking. We finally implement PMM in Covisor. Experiments with both real-world rulesets and synthetic rulesets show that PMM can detect misconfigurations of SDN policies in cloud networks within hundreds of milliseconds.}

First, we present an in-depth analysis of the security and privacy characteristics of the most prominent contact tracing protocols, under both passive and active adversaries. The results of our study indicate that all protocols are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, mainly due to the deterministic nature of the underlying cryptographic protocols. Our second contribution is the design and implementation of SpreadMeNot , a novel contact tracing protocol that can defend against most passive and active attacks, thus providing strong (provable) security and privacy guarantees that are necessary for such a sensitive application. Our detailed analysis, both formal and experimental, shows that SpreadMeNot satisfies security, privacy, and performance requirements, hence being an ideal candidate for building a contact tracing solution that can be adopted by the majority of the general public, as well as to serve as an open-source reference for further developments in the field.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we show that Hybrid Routing and Prophet protocols in Opportunistic Mobile Networks (OMNs) are vulnerable to the CollusiveHijack attack, in which a malicious attacker, Eve, compromises a set of nodes and lies about their Inter-Contact-Times (ICTs). Eve claims that her nodes meet more frequently than in reality to hijack the routes of legitimate nodes in OMNs. The CollusiveHijack attack enables Eve to launch more severe attacks like packet modification, traffic analysis, and incentive seeking attacks. To identify the CollusiveHijack attack, we propose the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test to determine whether the statistical distribution of the packets’ delays follows the derived distribution from the ICTs among the nodes. We propose three techniques to detect the CollusiveHijack attack, the Path Detection Technique (PDT), the Hop Detection Technique (HDT), and the Early Hop Detection Technique (EHDT), which trade off compatibility with the Bundle Security Protocol, the detection rate, and the detection latency. We evaluated our techniques through extensive trace-driven simulations and a proof-of-concept system implementation and show that they can detect CollusiveHijack attacks with 80.0% to 99.4% detection rates (when Eve hijacks more than 60 packets) while maintaining a low false positive rate (\n∼\n3.6%) and a short detection latency (7-14 hours) for EHDT (75%-85% enhancement compared to PDT and HDT).}

	abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) has been adopted in various applications such as Gigwalk and Uber, where a platform takes location-based tasks (e.g., picking up passengers) from a requester and selects suitable workers to perform them. In most existing works, the platform selects workers based on the requester and worker information, which suffers from serious privacy issues. Some works have considered privacy issues, but they still suffer from either of two limitations: (i) Privacy of the requester and worker cannot be protected simultaneously; (ii) Third-party trusted entities are usually required. Motivated by this, we focus on protecting the privacy of both the requester and the worker without third-party entities while selecting workers. We use randomized response, a widely recognized and prevalent privacy model achieving Local Differential Privacy (LDP), to jointly protect the privacy of workers’ locations and charges based on the location-charge correlation. For the requester, we present a novel mechanism called randomized matrix multiplication to hide the real task locations. More importantly, we prove that the worker selection based on the protected information is non-submodular and NP-hard, which cannot be addressed in polynomial time. To this end, we present an approximate algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, of which the effectiveness is measured by the approximation ratio, i.e., the ratio of the optimal solution to the approximate solution. Finally, simulations based on real-world datasets illustrate that our worker selection outperforms the state-of-the-art method on both privacy protection and worker selection.}

Sensitive data can be modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that nearby Wi-Fi-capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices) can intercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the Internet. We utilized the physical layer information exposed by the Wi-Fi chips to extract the signals. We further implemented the transmitter and receiver and discussed design considerations and implementation details. We evaluated this covert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and presented a set of countermeasures.

	abstract = {In data-driven anti-fraud engineering for online payment services, the integration of proper function modules is an effective way to further improve detection performance by overcoming the inability of single-function methods to cope with complex and varied frauds. However, a qualified integration is really inaccessible under multiple demanding requirements, i.e., improving detection performance, ensuring decision explainability, and limiting processing latency and computing consumption. In this work, we propose a qualified integration system, named CAeSaR, that can simultaneously meet all of the above requirements. This satisfactory result is achieved by the cooperation of two innovative techniques. The first is a novel three-way taxonomy of function division, called TRTPT, according to the temporal positions of transactions relative to a reference fraudulent transaction. Based on TRTPT, CAeSaR can introduce three kinds of anti-fraud function modules which collaboratively cover all types of frauds theoretically. The second is an effective integration scheme, called TELSI. It generates the candidate decision strategies by combining the judgments of three function modules by only two simple logical connectives, which essentially ensures the decision explainability. Particularly, TELSI can assign the most effective decision strategy to the corresponding transaction adaptively by a devised stacking-based multi-classification. The advantages of CAeSaR are validated in practice over real-life data from a prestigious bank.}

	abstract = {Biometric applications makes biometric authentication replace the traditional password in many cases. Biometric recognition technology has the advantages of convenience and high stability, facilitating identity recognition. However, the shortcoming of biometric authentication is easy to be stolen and leaked, which raises security concerns. In this paper, we design a lightweight joint biometric authentication scheme (SELBA) based on face and fingerprint. We improve searchable encryption (SE) to protect the privacy security of extracted biometric features in the storage and authentication stage. Because of the problem that biometric features cannot be changed or retrieved once leaked in existing schemes, we propose a cancelable mechanism to reconstruct stolen or damaged biometric templates. Moreover, we make a complete security analysis of the SELBA to meet the confidentiality, renewability, revocability, irreversibility and unlinkability of template in biometric recognition. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments on real data sets to show that SELBA is secure, efficient and easy to use in practical application scenarios.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks either by examples with indistinguishable perturbations which produce incorrect predictions, or by examples with noticeable transformations that are still predicted as the original label. The latter case is known as the Type I attack which, however, has achieved limited attention in literature. We advocate that the vulnerability comes from the ambiguous distributions among different classes in the resultant feature space of the model, which is saying that the examples with different appearances may present similar features. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Type I attack method called generative adversarial attack (GAA). Specifically, GAA aims at exploiting the distribution mapping from the source domain of multiple classes to the target domain of a single class by using generative adversarial networks. A novel loss and a U-net architecture with latent modification are elaborated to ensure the stable transformation between the two domains. In this way, the generated adversarial examples have similar appearances with examples of the target domain, yet obtaining the original prediction by the model being attacked. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method generates adversarial images that are more visually similar to the target images than the competitors, and the state-of-the-art performance is achieved.}

	abstract = {Identifying the nature of data flows can help improve network service and security. Most existing solutions usually simplify the traffic classification to protocol and application identification based on some uniqueness assumptions. However, in the real world these assumptions aren't always reasonable due to the abuse of multiplexing techniques. In this work, a new scheme is proposed from a different perspective that aims to directly identify the content inside a data flow without considering the external protocols and applications. We use wavelet to obtain the time-scale signals of each data flow and develop a new hidden Markov tree (HMT) with an embedding deep neural network (DNN) to model these signals. Each hidden state of the HMT represents a specific signal generation pattern. Transition of hidden states describes the time-scale context of the signal patterns. DNN is used to describe the probabilistic relationship between the implicit patterns and the observed time-scale signals. We derive new algorithms for the model and create an instance for each type of traffic, which projects the data flows into a multi-dimensional decision space and achieves their content identification through a classifier. Numerical experiments using real datasets are presented to validate the proposed scheme. Performance-related issues and comparisons with related works are discussed.}

	abstract = {Expressive data sharing and efficient data deletion are essential to drive the development of cloud-assisted IoT. But insecure transmission and the vulnerability of the cloud server may cause potential threats to IoT data, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is widely applied to ensure data confidentially. Nonetheless, the potential data exposure caused by the compromised long-term key and the contradiction between conventional access structures in ABE and the various demands of data owners are still two huge challenges. To overcome these challenges, this article designs an unbounded and puncturable ciphertext-policy ABE with arithmetic span program (\nUP\n-\nCP\n-\nABE\n-\nASP\n) scheme and presents an expressive data sharing and self-controlled fine-grained data deletion solution in cloud-assisted IoT, which allows data owners to efficiently encrypt and share data with various computable access policies, but also enables data owners and data users to independently delete specific data stored in the cloud. The designed\nUP\n-\nCP\n-\nABE\n-\nASP\nleverages unbounded ABE and puncturable encryption to support the flexible update of system parameters and the deletion of specific data. Also, the arithmetic span program access structure is combined to realize expressive data sharing. Moreover, the\nUP\n-\nCP\n-\nABE\n-\nASP\nis adaptively secure in the standard model, and comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate its practicability and scalability in cloud-assisted IoT.}

	abstract = {Organizations tend to collaboratively train the deep learning model over their combined datasets for a common benefit (e.g., better-trained model or learning a complicated model). However, due to the consideration about privacy leakage, organizations cannot share their data directly, especially related to sensitive domains. In this article, a privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning mechanism, namely Sigma, is designed to allow participating organizations to train a collective model without exposing their local training data to the others. Specifically, a single-server-aided private collaborative architecture is introduced to achieve the private collaborative learning, which protects organizations’ data even if\nn−1\nout of\nn\nparticipants colluded. We also design a practical protocol to perform the secure model training, which can resist the typical inference attack through the sharing information. After that, we propose a fair model releasing mechanism for participants and introduce differential privacy to prevent model stealing and membership inference attack. Furthermore, we prove that Sigma can ensure participants’ privacy preservation and analyze the communication overhead in theory. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of Sigma, we conduct an experiment over two real-world datasets and the simulation results demonstrate that Sigma can efficiently achieve the collaborative model training and effectively resist the membership inference attack.}

	abstract = {Steganalysis aims to reveal covert communication established via steganography. In the arm race with steganography, steganalysis has evolved from the old-style hand-crafted features set to deep-learning architectures. However, recent studies show that the majority of existing deep steganalysis models have a large amount of redundancy, which leads to a huge waste of storage and computing resources. The existing model compression method cannot flexibly compress the convolutional layer in residual shortcut block so that a satisfactory shrinking rate cannot be obtained. In this article, we propose STD-NET, an unsupervised deep-learning architecture search approach via hierarchical tensor decomposition for image steganalysis. Our proposed strategy will not be restricted by various residual connections, since this strategy does not change the number of input and output channels of the convolution block. We propose a normalized distortion threshold to evaluate the sensitivity of each involved convolutional layer of the base model to guide STD-NET to compress target network in an efficient and unsupervised approach, and obtain two network structures of different shapes with low computation cost and similar performance compared with the original one. Extensive experiments have confirmed that, on one hand, our model can achieve comparable or even better detection performance in various steganalytic scenarios due to the great adaptivity of the obtained network architecture. On the other hand, the experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed strategy is more efficient and can remove more redundancy compared with previous steganalytic network compression methods.}

While prior studies have proposed techniques to enable efficient error-resilience (e.g., selective instruction duplication), a fundamental requirement for realizing these techniques is a detailed understanding of the application's resilience. In this work, we present TensorFI 1 and TensorFI 2, high-level fault injection (FI) frameworks for TensorFlow-based applications. TensorFI 1 and 2 are able to inject both hardware and software faults in any general TensorFlow 1 and 2 program respectively. Both are configurable FI tools that are flexible, easy to use, and portable. They can be integrated into existing TensorFlow programs to assess their resilience for different fault types (e.g., bit-flips in particular operations or layers). We use TensorFI 1 and TensorFI 2 to evaluate the resilience of 11 and 10 ML programs respectively, all written in TensorFlow, including DNNs used in the autonomous vehicle domain. The results give us insights into why some of the models are more resilient. We also measure the performance overheads of the two injectors, and present 4 case studies, two for each tool, to demonstrate their utility.}

With the growing of safety- and security-critical applications built upon deep learning frameworks, their reliability is becoming increasingly important. To ensure the reliability of these frameworks, several efforts have been taken to study the causes and symptoms of bugs in deep learning frameworks, however, relatively little progress has been made in investigating the fault triggering conditions of those bugs. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study on fault triggering conditions in three widely-used deep learning frameworks (i.e., TensorFlow, MXNET and PaddlePaddle). We have collected 3,555 bug reports from GitHub repositories of these frameworks. A bug classification is performed based on fault triggering conditions, followed by the analysis of frequency distribution of different bug types and the evolution features. The correlations between bug types and fixing time are investigated. Moreover, we have also studied the root causes of Bohrbugs and Mandelbugs and investigated the important consequences of each bug type. Finally, the analysis of regression bugs in deep learning frameworks is conducted. We have revealed 12 important findings based on our empirical results and have provided 10 implications for developers and users.}

	abstract = {Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complex systems that must consider different aspects such as safety, compliance to traffic regulations, comfort, etc. The relative importance of these aspects is usually balanced in a weighted cost function. However, there is generally no optimal set of weights, and different driving situations may require different weights values to guarantee a safe drive. Recent testing approaches can generate diverse driving scenarios in which different ADS configurations lead to various degrees of hazard. These tests need to be properly analyzed to improve the ADS's safety. In this paper, we propose an analysis approach that is able to assess the relation between the ADS configurations and the level of hazard that is obtained in some particular traffic situations. The approach uses fuzzification to partition ADS weights in different categories, and a spectrum-based analysis to identify which weights categories are related to hazard and safety. The occurrence of a hazard could be due to a single weight or to combinations of two or more weights. For scalability, the approach performs an incremental analysis, in which first single weights are considered, and then weight combinations of higher order. The approach has been applied to an industrial path planner.}

To support the definition of safe and robust vehicle architectures and intelligent systems, in this paper we define the failure modes of a vehicle camera, together with an analysis of effects and known mitigations. Further, we build a software library for the generation of the corresponding failed images, and we feed them to six object detectors for mono and stereo cameras and to the self-driving agent of an autonomous driving simulator.

	abstract = {Continuity and steadiness are vital for services with massive users, which requires the anomalies of services should be detected and resolved in a timely manner. Our previous work proposed a tool, namely ImpAPTr (Impact Analysis based on Pruning Tree) , to identify the combination of multiple dimensional attributes as the clues leading to the root cause of service anomalies. However, ImpAPTr applies a threshold driven strategy, i.e., it needs to be triggered by a\n≥0.05%\ndrop of the success rate of the service calls (abbr. SRSC ), which may face problems in an atypical yet pervasive situation in field application. For example, the combination of trivial anomalies (i.e., each causes a drop less than 0.05% to SRSC ) can lead to a far more than 0.05% drop on SRSC . Besides, a suitable threshold is usually hard to be determined, etc. To address these problems, we propose a new method, namely ImpAPTr+ in this paper to free the constraint of the 0.05% threshold. The basic idea is to involve time dimension and identify clues across multiple time intervals of data. We performed evaluation on three typical methods (i.e., ImpAPTr+ , R-Adtributor and Squeeze ) with both production environment dataset and simulation dataset. The former dataset is directly retrieved from the service monitoring data in Meituan , one of the largest on-line service providers worldwide. The latter dataset is fabricated also using the monitoring data from the same company. The results indicate: (1) ImpAPTr+ outperforms previous approaches to a large degree in terms of accuracy. (2) Both ImpAPTr+ and R-Adtributor are able to find proper clues within seconds. (3) ImpAPTr+ tends to find proper clues with shorter time intervals (i.e., less data), which implies that the method is more suitable for near real-time monitoring scenarios.}

	abstract = {Modern distributed systems generate interleaved logs when running in parallel. Identifiers (ID) are always attached to them to trace running instances or entities in logs. Therefore, log messages can be grouped by the same IDs to help anomaly detection and localization. The existing approaches to achieve this still fall short meeting these challenges: 1) Log is solely processed in single components without mining log dependencies. 2) Log formats are continually changing in modern software systems. 3) It is challenging to detect latent performance issues non-intrusively by trivial monitoring tools. To remedy the above shortcomings, we propose SwissLog, a robust anomaly detection and localization tool for interleaved unstructured logs. SwissLog focuses on log sequential anomalies and tries to dig out possible performance issues. SwissLog constructs ID relation graphs across distributed components and groups log messages by IDs. Moreover, we propose an online data-driven log parser without parameter tuning. The grouped log messages are parsed via the novel log parser and transformed with semantic and temporal embedding. Finally, SwissLog utilizes an attention-based Bi-LSTM model and a heuristic searching algorithm to detect and localize anomalies in instance-granularity, respectively. The experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of SwissLog.}

	abstract = {Ozment and Schechter (USENIX Security’2006) analyzed the evolution of OpenBSD vulnerabilities over the span of 7 years (1998-2005) and concluded that its security increases with age. In this paper, we extend their study by analyzing the evolution of OpenBSD vulnerabilities over the span of 22 years (1998-2020) and Firefox vulnerabilities over the span of 9 years (2011-2020). Our empirical study leads to a number of insights, including the following: both OpenBSD and Firefox get more secure (i.e., less vulnerable) with time, but today’s developers do not necessarily produce more secure code; OpenBSD and Firefox developers tend to make similar security mistakes, but Firefox vulnerabilities are easier to exploit; finally, Firefox’s vulnerability density is almost one order of magnitude higher than OpenBSD’s, meaning Firefox is more vulnerable.}

	abstract = {Previous work has shown that early resolution of issues detected by static code analyzers can prevent major costs later on. However, developers often ignore such issues for two main reasons. First, many issues should be interpreted to determine if they correspond to actual flaws in the program. Second, static analyzers often do not present the issues in a way that is actionable. To address these problems, we present Sorald : a novel system that uses metaprogramming templates to transform the abstract syntax trees of programs and suggests fixes for static analysis warnings. Thus, the burden on the developer is reduced from interpreting and fixing static issues, to inspecting and approving full fledged solutions. Sorald automatically fixes violations of 10 rules of SonarQube , a single Java static analyzer that is among the mostly used. We evaluate Sorald on a dataset of 161 popular repositories on Github . Our analysis shows the effectiveness of Sorald as it fixes 65% (852/1,307) of the violations that meets the repair preconditions. Overall, our experiments show it is possible to automatically fix notable violations of the static analysis rules produced by the state-of-the-art static analyzer SonarQube .}

	abstract = {The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) integrated architecture is a key enabling platform for 5G to run multiple customized services in the form of service function chain (SFC) configured as an ordered set of service functions (SFs). However, memory-related software aging in the SF that can be exploited by attackers becomes a new threat to the dependability of MEC-SFC services. To provide dependable MEC-SFC services, proactive rejuvenation techniques to counteract the SF aging problem are essential. In this paper, we develop a semi-Markov model to quantitatively investigate the transient availability and steady-state dependability (availability and reliability) of MEC-SFC services. Our model enables the analysis of a MEC-SFC with any number of SFs, and can capture complex time-dependent behaviors of aging, failure, and recovery. The approximate accuracies of the presented model on dependability measures are comprehensively evaluated through comparative studies with simulation experiments. We then detect potential bottlenecks for a MEC-SFC system through sensitivity analysis and further analyze the impact of event-time interval distributions on steady-state dependability. Finally, we investigate the transient behaviors of a MEC-SFC service when varying system parameters during MEC-SFC operation.}

Unfortunately, previous studies have focused on letters-only passwords or passwords that include both letters and digits, and few empirical studies have been conducted on the security of digital passwords, let alone the regional differences in digital passwords. In this paper, we studied the vulnerability of pure six-digit passwords extracted from the leaked dataset of the Chinese website. We used the Pearson chi-square test to check whether each digit in the password obeyed a uniform distribution. We showed regional conventions for Chinese digital passwords. We proposed using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model password resistance to guessing attacks and explore how different architectures and training methods impact the effectiveness of neural networks. The experimental results on five website datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in terms of both learning efficiency and matching accuracy.}

As a special BP, a decision tree is a popular machine learning classifier for its effectiveness and simplicity. In this work, we propose a UC-secure efficient 3-party computation platform for outsourced branching program and/or decision tree evaluation. We construct a constant-round protocol and a linear-round protocol. In particular, the overall (online + offline) communication cost of our linear-round protocol is\nO(d(ℓ+logm+logn))\nand its round complexity is\n2d−1\n, where\nm\nis the DAG size,\nn\nis the number of features,\nℓ\nis the feature length, and\nd\nis the longest path length. To enable efficient oblivious hopping among the DAG nodes, we propose a lightweight 1-out-of-\nN\nshared OT protocol with logarithmic communication in both online and offline phase. This partial result may be of independent interest to some other cryptographic protocols. Our benchmark shows, compared with the state-of-the-arts, the proposed constant-round protocol is up to 10X faster in the WAN setting, while the proposed linear-round protocol is up to 15X faster in the LAN setting.}

	abstract = {Security and privacy issues have become a major hindrance to the broad adoption of Ride-Hailing Services (RHSs). In this article, we introduce a new collusion attack initiated by the Ride-Hailing Service Provider (RHSP) and a driver that could easily link the real riders and their anonymous requests (credentials). Besides this attack, existing work requires heavy computations to execute user matching, and it is challenging for riders to verify matching results. Meanwhile, a malicious driver may cancel an assigned ride order due to its short distance. To address these issues, we present a RHS system named Nereus to support collusion resistance, efficiency, verifiability, and accountability. First, we integrate a smart contract into a Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclave to establish a private smart contract for collusion resistance. We use a Bloom filter to achieve efficient matching. Second, we leverage privacy-preserving range query and Merkle proofs to make matching results verifiable. Meanwhile, we adopt short group signatures to provide anonymous authentication and deposit commitments to hold the runaway driver accountable. We formally state and prove the security and privacy of Nereus. We build a prototype based on Ethereum and SGX to conduct extensive performance analysis in regard to gas costs, computational costs, and communication overhead. Experimental results show that Nereus significantly improves over existing schemes in terms of computational costs.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks, where minor modifications on the input are able to mislead the models to give wrong results. Although defenses against adversarial attacks have been widely studied, investigation on mitigating backdoor attacks is still at an early stage. It is unknown whether there are any connections and common characteristics between the defenses against these two attacks. We conduct comprehensive studies on the connections between adversarial examples and backdoor examples of Deep Neural Networks to seek to answer the question: can we detect backdoor using adversarial detection methods. Our insights are based on the observation that both adversarial examples and backdoor examples have anomalies during the inference process, highly distinguishable from benign samples. As a result, we revise four existing adversarial defense methods for detecting backdoor examples. Extensive evaluations indicate that these approaches provide reliable protection against backdoor attacks, with a higher accuracy than detecting adversarial examples. These solutions also reveal the relations of adversarial examples, backdoor examples and normal samples in model sensitivity, activation space and feature space. This is able to enhance our understanding about the inherent features of these two attacks and the defense opportunities.}

HSS schemes cannot guarantee correct reconstruction, if some servers are malicious and provide wrong partial results. Recently, verifiable HSS (VHSS) has been introduced to achieve an additional property: (iii) any $t$ colluding servers cannot persuade the client(s) to accept their partial results and reconstruct a wrong value. The property (iii) is usually achieved by the client verifying the servers’ partial results. A VHSS scheme is compact if the verification is substantially faster than locally computing $f(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})$ . Of the existing VHSS schemes for polynomials, some are not compact; the others are compact but impose very heavy workload on the servers, even for low degree polynomials (e.g., they are at least 4000× slower than the existing HSS schemes in order to evaluate polynomials of degree $\\leq 5$ , which have many applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning). In this paper, we propose both a single-client VHSS (SVHSS) model and a multi-client VHSS (MVHSS) model. Our SVHSS allows a client to use a secret key to share its data among servers; our MVHSS allows multiple clients to share their data with a public key. For any integers $m,t>0$ , we constructed both an $(m,t)$ -SVHSS scheme and an $(m,t)$ -MVHSS scheme that satisfy the properties of (i)-(iii). Our constructions are based on level- $k$ homomorphic encryptions. The $(m,t)$ -SVHSS and $(m,t)$ -MVHSS are compact and allow the computations of degree- $d$ polynomials for $d\\leq ((k+1)m-1)/t$ and $d\\leq ((k+1)(m-t)-1)/t$ , respectively. Experiments show that our schemes are much more efficient than the existing compact VHSS for low degree polynomials. For example, to compute polynomials of degree $\\leq 5$ , our MVHSS scheme is at least 420× faster. By applying SVHSS and MVHSS, we may add verifiability to privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) algorithms. Experiments show that the resulting schemes are at least 52× and 20× faster than the existing verifiable PPML schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, almost all the proposed adaptive video steganographic schemes are based on minimizing an additive embedding distortion. However, they ignore the hard fact that the additive embedding distortion is not quite suitable for video steganography because of the interplay of cover elements in video steganography. In this article, an adaptive intra prediction mode based (IPM-based) video steganography is proposed by minimizing the non-additive distortion in HEVC. To reduce the complexity of minimizing the non-additive distortion, a multi-layered embedding structure combined with a proposed embedding distortion updating strategy is adopted to approximate the non-additive distortion in an additive form. First, all IPMs are decomposed into multiple layers based on the distortion drift graph to offer multi-layered embedding. Each IPM in the same layer is considered to be independent, and syndrome-trellis code (STC) can be applied to embed the message segment into each layer with an additive distortion function sequentially. Then, a distortion function composed of self-distortion and drift-distortion is proposed to initialize the distortion of modifying each IPM. Finally, after embedding the first message segment into the IPMs in the first layer with the initialized distortions, an embedding distortion updating strategy is applied to update the distortions of the IPMs in the remaining layers dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive IPM-based video steganography can achieve much better perceptual quality and security performance than the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {The indoor navigation system supported by spatial crowdsourcing emerges as a promising application to provide customized location service for requesters. An important stage of crowdsourcing is to select trustworthy workers. Workers’ reputation, as an essential criterion of this selection, is usually evaluated by feedback ratings from requesters. However, the reputation in the crowdsourcing-based indoor navigation system is vulnerable to the collusion attack, that is malicious workers (i.e., attackers) collude with requesters to illegally increase reputation. In this paper, we propose a collusion detection scheme to distinguish attackers and provide a secure reputation mechanism. Specifically, we first identify collusive requesters categorized into three different levels according to their feedback rating behaviors. Then, the weighted logistic regression (WLR) is developed to distinguish the collusive requesters who provide exorbitant feedback ratings. Furthermore, we employ an outlying sequence detection based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), to resist the multiple location queries initiated by the same collusive requester through analyzing the distribution distance. In addition, we propose a community detection algorithm, named Fastgreedy, to identify the collusion from many requesters. Finally, the extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively detect collusive requesters and significantly outperform other methods.}

Unfortunately, the HostOS/Hypervisor, especially the QEMU-KVM architecture, is not immune to all vulnerabilities and exploitations. Recently, researchers have put forward lots of schemes to protect Virtual Machines under the compromised HostOS/Hypervisor. However, some of these schemes rely on special hardware facilities, while other (e.g., Nested Virtualization schemes) require large modification to current commercial cloud architecture. In this paper, we present a novel scheme, named HyperPS, to implement virtual machine protection under the compromised HostOS/Hypervisor. The key idea of HyperPS is to deprive the HostOS/Hypervisor of the privileges of managing the physical memory into an isolated and trusted execution environment. HyperPS does not rely customized hardware or extra processor privilege. HyperPS shares the same privilege with the HostOS. We have implemented a fully functional prototype based on the KVM in Intel x86_64 architecture. Experiment results show that HyperPS has achieved an acceptable trade-off between security and performance.}

	abstract = {Database fingerprinting is widely adopted to prevent unauthorized data sharing and identify the source of data leakages. Although existing schemes are robust against common attacks, their robustness degrades significantly if attackers utilize inherent correlations among database entries. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of existing schemes by identifying different correlation attacks: column-wise correlation attack, row-wise correlation attack, and their integration. We provide robust fingerprinting against these attacks by developing mitigation techniques, which can work as post-processing steps for any off-the-shelf database fingerprinting schemes and preserve the utility of databases. We investigate the impact of correlation attacks and the performance of mitigation techniques using a real-world database. Our results show (i) high success rates of correlation attacks against existing fingerprinting schemes (e.g., integrated correlation attack can distort 64.8% fingerprint bits by just modifying 14.2% entries in a fingerprinted database), and (ii) high robustness of mitigation techniques (e.g., after mitigation, integrated correlation attack can only distort 3% fingerprint bits). Additionally, the mitigation techniques effectively alleviate correlation attacks even if (i) attackers have access to correlation models directly computed from the original database, while the database owner uses inaccurate correlation models, (ii) or attackers utilize higher order of correlations than the database owner.}

	abstract = {Swarm attestation, as an important branch of Remote Attestation (RA), enables a trusted party ( verifier ) to verify the security states of multiple devices ( provers ) in a large network ( swarm ) simultaneously via a challenge-response mechanism. However, swarm attestation suffers from significant redundancy overhead since all devices in the swarm need to be attested in each attestation round. Besides, it faces challenges such as verifier-impersonation Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, highly dynamic networks, transient & self-relocating malware, and Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks. In this paper, considering not only the detection accuracy but also the privacy of swarm owners in real Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, we propose an Automatic Federated Swarm Attestation scheme (FeSA). Under this scheme, we design a federated-learning-based automatic swarm attestation protocol that enables the verifiers to identify the suspicious devices by a neural network model and then attest them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme to apply a federated learning method to RA, ruling out the redundancy attestation rounds while preserving data privacy. The FeSA redesigns the interaction model of RA by a challenge-query mechanism to reduce the overhead of an individual device to a constant. In order to evaluate our scheme, we first set up a smart office environment with 12 types of smart IoT devices for real-world data collection up to 21 days. Based on the real dataset, we demonstrate that FeSA can indeed identify the compromised IoT devices while reducing redundancy. We further simulate large-scale swarms of up to 1,000,000 devices to validate the efficiency of FeSA in large-scale swarms. Last, the security analysis proves the ability of FeSA to resist various attacks.}

	abstract = {The deployment of ultra-dense networks in the fifth-generation (5 G) network architecture can significantly improve the quality of wireless links, but this will cause frequent handovers of mobile users and increase authentication delays. Furthermore, the simultaneous influx of a large number of mobile users may cause serious network congestion. Aiming at these problems, this article proposes a novel authentication scheme supporting multi-user access, which fully considers the scenarios of intra-domain handover and inter-domain handover across AMF. Using the characteristics of the network architecture integrated with mobile edge computing (MEC) and software-defined networks (SDN), the user's moving path can be predicted in advance to speed up the handover process. Most importantly, the proposed scheme can perform secure, efficient and flexible mutual authentication and key agreement between the group and the core network by using aggregated message authentication codes with detecting functionality (AMAD) and contributory broadcast encryption technique. Through the use of BAN Logic and Scyther tool verification, the proposed scheme can not only realize multiple user authentication and key agreement, but also fulfill various security goals. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has moderate computational and communication overhead, and lower transmission overhead compared with existing schemes, which can effectively reduce authentication delay.}

	abstract = {Although proxy-assisted revocable attribute-based encryption provides fine-grained privacy protection and reduces the decryption cost of data users, it inherits several disadvantages in outsourcing decryption. The decryption capability in outsourcing decryption is divided into two parts: the outsourcing transformation key and the user decryption key. The proxy server utilizes transformation keys to transform the ciphertext which can only be decrypted by the users who generated the transformation key. When multiple users with the same attributes request outsourcing transformation, the proxy server must do numerous transformation operations, increasing the computing overhead of the proxy server and the user request response time. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a multi-proxy assisted revocable attribute group-based encryption (MP-RAGBE) scheme. We form a user group out of users who have the same attributes and send the transformation keys directly to the proxy server. Users in the same group can decrypt the transformed ciphertext, and only a small number of transformation keys need to be updated when revocation occurs. The security and experimental analyses show that the proposed scheme meets the defined security requirements while significantly reducing user request response time, the overhead of transformation key generation, transmission, and ciphertext transformation.}

	abstract = {Many regions are in urgent need of facial masks for slowing down the spread of COVID-19. To fight the pandemic, people are contributing masks through donation systems. Most existing systems are built on a centralized architecture which is prone to the single point of failure and lack of transparency. Blockchain-based solutions neglect fundamental privacy concerns ( donation privacy ) and security attacks ( collusion attack, stealing attack ). Moreover, current auditing solutions are not designed to achieve donation privacy, thus not appropriate in our context. In this work, we design a decentralized, anonymous, and secure auditing framework Astraea based on private smart contracts for donation systems. Specifically, we integrate a Distribute Smart Contract (DiSC) with an SGX Enclave to distribute donations, prove the integrity of donation number (intention) and donation sum while preserving donation privacy. With DiSC, we design a Donation Smart Contract to refund deposits and defend against the stealing attack the collusion attack from malicious collector and transponder. We formally define and prove the privacy and security of Astraea by using security reduction. We build a prototype of Astraea to conduct extensive performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Astraea is practically efficient in terms of both computation and communication.}

	abstract = {Various fine-grained randomization schemes have been designed to increase the entropy of process space, while none of them can rise from an academic exercise to industrial deployment like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). One of the critical reasons is the incorrectness of randomization caused by the mismatch between their pointer collection capabilities and the high accuracy requirements of the pointer patching task. In this article, we present PointerScope, an accurate compile-time pointer collection scheme deriving from a group of novel observations. The success of PointerScope relies on the complete tracing of the pointer generation process, including the compilation chain from compiler to static linker and the interface specification between them. From this view, PointerScope identifies four types of pointer-related static linker behaviors and clarifies five types of inherent addressing modes in the x86-64 architecture. The vague understanding of them causes the Compiler-assisted Code Randomization (CCR) to incorrectly collect pointers and patch them to the wrong values after randomization. Further, we measure the pointer collection capability of augmented binary analysis, the experimental results show that they can mitigate challenges from the traditional binary analysis by the given premises, but additional heuristics still need to be designed to support the fine-grained randomization.}

	abstract = {With the global prevalence of mobile devices, concerns about mobile devices regarding privacy breaches and data leakage are rising. Although sensor permissions are required for mobile applications to access outputs of built-in sensors, motion sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) can be visited directly without permission requirement. Extant studies have shown that motion sensors may cause breaches of confidential information, such as passwords, digits, and voice-based commands, but whether it is possible to synthesize intelligible speech waveforms from low-resolution motion sensors has been understudied. In this article, we present an escalated side-channel attack of built-in speakers by synthesizing intelligible speech waveforms from low-resolution vibration signals. Opposite to traditional classification problems, we formulate this task as a generative problem and introduce an end-to-end synthesis framework dubbed as AccMyrinx to eavesdrop on the speaker via the low-resolution vibration signals. In AccMyrinx , we introduce the data alignment solution to provide the pair-wise voice-vibration sequences and present wavelet-based MelGAN (WMelGAN) with multi-scale time-frequency domain discriminators to generate intelligible acoustic waveforms. We conducted intensive experiments and demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing the intelligible acoustic signals from low-resolution solid-borne vibration signals. Compared with existing synthesis solutions, our proposed solution outperforms the baselines in both subject and object metrics with the smoothed word error rate of 42.67% and the Mel-Cepstral distortion of 0.298. In addition, the quality of synthetic speeches could be impacted by several factors, including gender, speech rate, volume, and sampling frequency.}

	abstract = {Self-propagating worms can infect millions of computers on the Internet in just several minutes. As witnessed by the recent Mirai and WannaCry worms, worm attacks are real, destructive, and continue to persist. Although many worm detectors exist, most that we studied suffer from three drawbacks: none systematically consider countermeasures from worm authors, potentially causing low effectiveness against evasive worms; all focus on outbound worms leaving a network, leaving their efficacy against inbound worms entering a network unanswered; and many require bi-directional traffic to detect worms, making their placement on the Internet inflexible. We therefore revisit worm detection in this paper, while avoiding the aforementioned drawbacks of existing work. We describe our design of SWORD, a new worm detector that focuses on the fundamental behavior of worms. It includes two complementary modules to monitor connections from and to a protected network, with one module monitoring burst durations and the other ensuring quiescent periods. Via extensive experiments using both simulated worm traffic and a real-world Mirai worm trace, we demonstrate that SWORD is superior to existing detectors at not only detecting both classic and evasive outbound worms, but also inbound worms, especially those that are superspreading or surreptitious.}

HSM based security solution is recommended by auto industry to protect CAN FD from potential security attacks, but it induces new challenges on timing analysis of CAN FD messages, which is left open in the literature. This article develops the first security-aware system model to describe the processing of CAN FD messages, and presents a new WCRT analysis to bound the interference induced by security-critical messages. We give the theoretical proof that our WCRT analysis can upper bound the response time of CAN FD messages. Using a small message set, we show that the WCRT computed by our new analysis is only 14% percent higher than the true WCRT obtained from an exhaustive search based simulator. By comparing with existing method, the number of impacted messages increases along with the increasing number of security critical messages, and for the two typical CAN FD systems, the percentage of WCRT increase varies from 12.43% to 14.57% and 7.0% to 10.89%, respectively; the percentage of WCRT decrease varies from 3.29% to 6.04% and 4.13% to 7.93%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications, which often handle assets of considerable value. While the underlying platforms guarantee the correctness of smart-contract execution, they cannot ensure that the code of a contract is correct. Today, as evidenced by a number of recent security breaches, developers still have a hard time making contracts that work properly.Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart-contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts in isolation. To address this gap, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a abstract state machine based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify the behavior of a set of interacting contracts at a high level of abstraction. VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code that is functionally and behaviorally equivalent to verified models, which enables the creation of correct-by-design smart contracts. We additionally introduce a graphical notation (called deployment diagrams ) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, we present a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. To demonstrate the applicability of VeriSolid , we translate existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) specifications to temporal properties for two of the most popular contract interfaces: ERC20 and ERC721. We also show you how to write code for the ERC20 and ERC721 interfaces in a way that is safe, and we do this by using VeriSolid . We evaluate our framework on 726 contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, which include 267 ERC20 and 459 ERC721 contracts. Our experiments indicate that 18% of ERC20 contracts and 4% of ERC721 contracts fail to satisfy the EIP specifications.}

	abstract = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have radically changed the way people communicate. The most widely used platforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram, claim more than one billion monthly active users each. Beyond these, news-oriented micro-blogging services, e.g., Twitter, are daily accessed by more than 120 million users sharing contents from all over the world. Unfortunately, legitimate users of the OSNs are mixed with malicious ones, which are interested in spreading unwanted, misleading, harmful, or discriminatory content. Spam detection in OSNs is generally approached by considering the characteristics of the account under analysis, its connection with the rest of the network, as well as data and metadata representing the content shared. However, obtaining all this information can be computationally expensive, or even unfeasible, on massive networks. Driven by these motivations, in this article we propose SpADe, a multi-stage Spam Account Detection algorithm with reject option, whose purpose is to exploit less costly features at the early stages, while progressively extracting more complex information only for those accounts that are difficult to classify. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to single-stage approaches, which are much more complex in terms of features processing and classification time.}

	abstract = {Eavesdropping via inertial measurement units (IMUs) has brought growing concerns over smartphone users’ privacy. In such attacks, adversaries utilize IMUs, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, which require zero permissions for access to acquire speeches. A common countermeasure is to limit sampling rates (within 200 Hz) to reduce overlap of vocal fundamental bands (85\n∼\n255 Hz) and inertial measurements (0\n∼\n100 Hz). Nevertheless, we observe that IMUs sampling below 200 Hz still record adequate speech-related information because of aliasing distortions. Accordingly, we propose a practical side-channel attack, namely InertiEAR , to break the defense of sampling rate restriction on the zero-permission eavesdropping. It leverages accelerometers and gyroscopes jointly to eavesdrop on both top and bottom speakers in smartphones. We exploit coherence between responses of the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope using a mathematical model. The coherence allows precise segmentation without manual assistance. We also mitigate the impact of hardware diversity and achieve better device-independent performance than existing approaches that have to massively increase training data from different smartphones for a scalable network model. These two advantages re-enable zero-permission attacks but also extend the attacking surface and endangering degree to off-the-shelf smartphones. InertiEAR achieves the recognition accuracy of 78.8% with the cross-device accuracy of up to 60.9% among 12 smartphones.}

	abstract = {Behavior-based anomaly detection (AD) approaches for enterprise-IT security are not easily applicable to other domains, such as embedded devices and IoT nodes in cyber-physical systems. AD approaches are usually highly optimized for specific purposes, tightly bound to domain-specific technologies and rely on a specific syntax of investigated data. Data from cyber-physical systems is however highly diverse, often poorly documented and not easily ingested for automated analysis. AECID provides an anomaly detection approach, that monitors unstructured textual event data (i.e., log data), and implements self-learning for autonomous operation. A parser generator establishes a model of normal system behavior on top of observed events, which then can be leveraged to detect anomalies as deviations from that baseline. The unsupervised anomaly detection approaches of AECID apply machine learning techniques to perform sequence analysis, correlation analysis and statistical tests of events represented in log data. This paper discusses AECID's applicability in a building security system use case. A proof of concept demonstrates the effective detection of anomalies in log data of a building access control system stemming from card misuse, including stolen access cards and cloned cards.}

	abstract = {Group Key Exchange (GKE) is an important tool to develop secure multi-user applications such as group text messages, ad-hoc networks, and so on. Most of the currently deployed GKE schemes are synchronous, i.e., they require all the participants to be online during their execution. However, with more battery-powered devices being used in such applications, the synchronicity requirement is challenging to fulfill. To fill the gaps, asynchronous GKE schemes have been introduced in the literature. Nevertheless, the currently available asynchronous and synchronous GKE schemes rely on Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) for key establishment and management. To this end, reliance on TTPs is a serious shortcoming since TTPs are well known to be the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing GKE schemes require participants to perform all computations, which can degrade the performance of resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an asynchronous GKE scheme that uses blockchain and smart contracts to store the security keys-related material and reduce the computational load of the participants. Furthermore, our proposed scheme provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Post-Compromised Security (PCS). Our implementation on Ethereum shows that the proposed scheme can scale to more than 100 participants when combined with a distributed storage system.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, machine learning models, especially neural networks, have became prevalent in many real-world applications. These models are trained based on a one-way trip from user data: as long as users contribute their data, there is no way to withdraw. To this end, machine unlearning becomes a popular research topic, which allows the model trainer to unlearn unexpected data from a trained machine learning model. In this article, we propose the first uniform metric called forgetting rate to measure the effectiveness of a machine unlearning method. It is based on the concept of membership inference and describes the transformation rate of the eliminated data from “memorized” to “unknown” after conducting unlearning. We also propose a novel unlearning method called Forsaken . It is superior to previous work in either utility or efficiency (when achieving the same forgetting rate). We benchmark Forsaken with eight standard datasets to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that it can achieve more than 90% forgetting rate on average and only causeless than 5% accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {The confidentiality of the operating system kernel addresses is crucial to keeping the kernel secure from malicious users. To avoid leaking this position, researchers have proposed various techniques to defeat the exploits of abnormal data flows embedded in the kernel's memory safety loopholes, such as uninitialized memory read and buffer over-reads. However, this is far from complete. The kernel address can be leaked even in normal data flows without exploiting memory safety loopholes. We have designed a static analysis tool named Hawkeye to fill the gap. It searches for kernel address leakages in normal data flows that reveal the kernel address clues. Hawkeye precisely identifies the kernel addresses with minimum manual annotation and scales to analyze the whole kernel source code. It requires nearly ten times fewer memory resources and 40 times less inspection time than the state-of-the-art tool that analyzes kernel address leakage. Hawkeye unveils hundreds of leakages in various versioned kernels. It has even discovered 20 bugs in the mainline Linux kernel with the kernel pointer hashing mechanism already deployed and three bugs in FreeBSD. All the corresponding patches have been accepted by the developers.}

Existing solutions, such as T-SGX, Déjà Vu, Cloak and Varys, detect side-channel attacks at runtime. But they are limited by design, because false detection is unavoidable in these detection methods and therefore any security policy developed atop these mechanisms has to tolerate some malicious operations to achieve practical false positive detection rates. In this article, we propose the concept of verifiable execution contracts, which request the privileged software to provide a benign execution environment for enclaves within which launching attacks becomes very difficult, if not impossible. Since the privileged software is untrusted, we design methods for verifying that the execution contracts are observed. With the proposed verifiable execution contracts, we analyzed how existing attacks could be mitigated.}

In this article, we investigate the security vulnerabilities of the existing neural communication system. Based on our analysis, we design two kinds of attack models, including target man-in-the-middle attack and target fraud attack . After that, to improve the security performance of neural communication systems, we develop a new defense mechanism to facilitate two-way secure communication by separating secret key from plaintext and incorporating defensive loss into the training process. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our proposed neural communication system via theoretical proof. Finally, we implement comprehensive real data experiments to evaluate the performance of our attack and defense methods from the aspects of classification accuracy, communication efficiency and communication qualify, which confirms the advantages of our proposed neural communication system compared with the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {Modern applications often involve the processing of sensitive information. However, the lack of privilege separation within the user space leaves sensitive application secrets such as cryptographic keys just as unprotected as a ”hello world” string. Cutting-edge hardware-supported security features are being introduced. However, the features are often vendor-specific or lack compatibility with older generations of the processors. The situation leaves developers with no portable solution to incorporate protection for the sensitive application component. We propose LOTRx86, a fundamental and portable approach for user-space privilege separation. Our approach creates a more privileged user execution layer called PrivUser by harnessing the underused intermediate privilege levels on the x86 architecture. The PrivUser memory space, a set of pages within process address space that are inaccessible to user mode, is a safe place for application secrets and routines that access them. We implement the LOTRx86 ABI that exports the privcall interface to users to invoke secret handling routines in PrivUser. This way, sensitive application operations that involve the secrets are performed in a strictly controlled manner. The memory access control in our architecture is privilege-based , accessing the protected application secret only requires a change in the privilege, eliminating the need for costly remote procedure calls or change in address space. We evaluated our platform by developing a proof-of-concept LOTRx86-enabled web server that employs our architecture to securely access its private key during an SSL connection. We conducted a set of experiments, including a performance measurement on the PoC on both Intel and AMD PCs, and confirmed that LOTRx86 incurs only a limited performance overhead.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces AGAPECert, an Auditable, Generalized, Automated, Privacy-Enabling, Certification framework capable of performing auditable computation on private data and reporting real-time aggregate certification status without disclosing underlying private data. AGAPECert utilizes a novel mix of trusted execution environments, blockchain technologies, and a real-time graph-based API standard to provide automated, oblivious, and auditable certification. Our technique allows a privacy-conscious data owner to run pre-approved Oblivious Smart Contract code in their own environment on their own private data to produce Private Automated Certifications. These certifications are verifiable, purely functional transformations of the available data, enabling a third party to trust that the private data must have the necessary properties to produce the resulting certification. Recently, a multitude of solutions for certification and traceability in supply chains have been proposed. These often suffer from significant privacy issues because they tend to take a ”shared, replicated database” approach: every node in the network has access to a copy of all relevant data and contract code to guarantee the integrity and reach consensus, even in the presence of malicious nodes. In these contexts of certifications that require global coordination, AGAPECert can include a blockchain to guarantee ordering of events, while keeping a core privacy model where private data is not shared outside of the data owner's own platform. AGAPECert contributes an open-source certification framework that can be adopted in any regulated environment to keep sensitive data private while enabling a trusted automated workflow.}

	abstract = {Content Centric Network (CCN) can be extended to efficiently and reliably support content delivery and solve the network performance degradation caused by dynamic topology and intermittent connectivity of Vehicle Ad hoc NETwork (VANET). However, the in-network caching mechanism of Vehicular Content Centric Network (VCCN) is vulnerable against Cache Pollution Attack (CPA), where attackers aim to fill the buffer space with non-popular contents by releasing fake requests. Unavoidably, the cache hit ratio of content requests from legal users is degraded and the content retrieval latency is increased under CPA. Hence, it is critical to detect and mitigate CPA. The current solutions for static CCN cannot be directly applied into dynamic VCCN. In this article, we propose a detection scheme based on hybrid heterogeneous multi-classifier ensemble learning, where CPA is determined by the cooperation of multiple vehicles. In our scheme, each vehicle can build or join a cluster whose head possesses more common moving attributes of position, speed and direction with other members. Besides, the cluster head as a base learner is responsible for training its own classifier by making some relevant statistics on requests and hit ratio. Specifically, the problem of ensemble classifier making from the individual classifiers is formulated as a linear optimization problem, with the goal of minimizing the false ratio of detecting CPA. The generalization ability of ensemble learning can make very accurate predictions on CPA. By comparison, our detection scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of detection ratio, hit ratio, retrieval delay. Besides, simulations have proved that the overfitting problem of adopting a singe base learning algorithm can be alleviated in our scheme.}

	abstract = {Peer to Peer (P2P) or direct connection IoT has become increasingly popular owing to its lower latency and higher privacy compared to database-driven or server-based IoT. However, wireless vulnerabilities raise severe concerns on IoT device-to-device communication. This is further aggravated by the challenge to achieve lightweight direct mutual authentication and secure key exchange between IoT peer nodes in P2P IoT applications. Physical unclonable function (PUF) is a key enabler to lightweight, low-power and secure authentication of resource-constrained devices in IoT. Nevertheless, current PUF-enabled authentication protocols, with or without the challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of each of its interlocutors stored in the verifier's side, are incompatible for P2P IoT scenarios due to the security, storage and computing power limitations of IoT devices. To solve this problem, a new lightweight PUF-based mutual authentication and key exchange protocol is proposed. It allows two resource-constrained PUF embedded endpoint devices to authenticate each other directly without the need for local storage of CRPs or any private secrets, and simultaneously establish the session key for secure data exchange without resorting to the public-key algorithm. The proposed protocol is evaluated using the game-based formal security analysis method as well as the automatic security analysis tool ProVerif to corroborate its mutual authenticity, secrecy, and resistance against replay and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Using two Avnet Ultra96-V2 boards to emulate the two IoT endpoint devices, a physical prototype system is also constructed to demonstrate and validate the feasibility of the proposed secure P2P connection scheme. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed protocol outperforms related protocols in terms of security features, computational complexity as well as communication and storage costs.}

	abstract = {Fault tree analysis is a well-known technique in reliability engineering and risk assessment, which supports decision-making processes and the management of complex systems. Traditionally, fault tree (FT) models are built manually together with domain experts, considered a time-consuming process prone to human errors. With Industry 4.0, there is an increasing availability of inspection and monitoring data, making techniques that enable knowledge extraction from large data sets relevant. Thus, our goal with this work is to propose a data-driven approach to infer efficient FT structures that achieve a complete representation of the failure mechanisms contained in the failure data set without human intervention. Our algorithm, the FT-MOEA, based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enables the simultaneous optimization of different relevant metrics such as the FT size, the error computed based on the failure data set and the Minimal Cut Sets. Our results show that, for six case studies from the literature, our approach successfully achieved automatic, efficient, and consistent inference of the associated FT models. We also present the results of a parametric analysis that tests our algorithm for different relevant conditions that influence its performance, as well as an overview of the data-driven methods used to automatically infer FT models.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an ideal privacy-preserving learning technique which can train a global model in a collaborative way while preserving the private data in the local. However, recent advances have demonstrated that FL is still vulnerable to inference attacks, such as reconstruction attack and membership inference. Among these attacks, the property inference attack, aiming to infer properties of the training data that are irrelevant with the learning objective, has not received too much attention while resulting in severe privacy leakage. Existing property inference attack approaches either cannot achieve satisfactory performance when the global model has converged or under dynamic FL where participants can drop in and drop out freely. In this paper, we propose a novel poisoning-assisted property inference attack (PAPI-attack) against FL. The key insight is that there exists underlying discriminative ability in the periodic model updates, which reflects the change of the data distribution, especially the occurrence of the sensitive property. Thus, a binary attack model can be constructed by a malicious participant for inferring the unintended information. More importantly, we present a property-specific poisoning mechanism by modifying the label of training data from the adversary to distort the decision boundary of shared (global) model in FL. Consequently, benign participants are induced to disclose more information about the sensitive property. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PAPI-attack outperforms the state-of-the-art property inference attacks against FL.}

	abstract = {Genome-wide analysis has demonstrated both health and social benefits. However, large scale sharing of such data may reveal sensitive information about individuals. One of the emerging challenges is identity tracing attack that exploits correlations among genomic data to reveal the identity of DNA samples. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the adversary can narrow down the sample's identity by detecting his/her genetic relatives and quantify such privacy threat by employing a Shannon entropy-based measurement. For example, we exemplify that when the dataset size reaches 30% of the population, for any target from that population, the uncertainty of the target's identity is reduced to merely 2.3 bits of entropy (i.e., the identity is pinned down within 5 people). Direct application of existing approaches such as differential privacy (DP), secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) may not be applicable to this challenge in genome-wide analysis because of the compromise on utility (i.e., accuracy or efficiency). Towards addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a framework named\nυ\nFrag to facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing and computation in genome-wide analysis.\nυ\nFrag mitigates privacy risks by using a vertical fragmentation to disrupt the genetic architecture on which the adversary relies for identity tracing without sacrificing the capability of genome-wide analysis. We theoretically prove that it preserves the correctness of the primitive functionalities and algorithms ranging from basic summary statistics to advanced neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nυ\nFrag outperforms secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) protocols, with a speedup of more than 221x for training neural networks, and also traditional non-private algorithms and a state-of-the-art noise-based differential privacy (DP) solution in most settings.}

	abstract = {Spatial keyword queries are attractive techniques that have been widely deployed in real-life applications in recent years, such as social networks and location-based services. However, existing solutions neither support dynamic update nor satisfy the privacy requirements in real applications. In this article, we investigate the problem of Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) for spatial keyword queries. First, we formulate the definition of DSSE for spatial keyword queries (namely,\nDSSE\nSKQ\n) and extend the DSSE leakage functions to capture the leakages in\nDSSE\nSKQ\n. Then, we present a practical\nDSSE\nSKQ\nconstruction based on geometric prefix encoding inverted-index and encrypted bitmap. Rigorous security analysis proves that our construction can achieve not only forward/backward privacy but content privacy as well, which can resist the most existing leakage-abuse attacks. Evaluation results using real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our construction. Comparative analysis reveals that our construction outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in terms of privacy and performance, e.g., our construction is\n175×\nfaster than existing schemes with only 51% server storage cost.}

	abstract = {A graph is a powerful abstraction for representing information. We address the problem of publishing a secure version of a graph that does not leak information to an adversary who may possess prior information about portions of the graph, and may have unbounded computational power. In this context, we revisit four notions of security, all of which are based on variants of graph isomorphism, that have been proposed in two different application contexts in the literature. We compare the four notions to one another, first from the standpoint of strength, i.e., whether meeting one notion implies meeting another, and then from the standpoint of computational hardness, i.e., what the exact computational complexity is for the problem of checking whether a graph meets a notion. For the latter, we identify that for two of the notions we consider, the problem is\nNP-complete\n, and for the two others, it is ISO -complete, where ISO is the class of problems induced by graph isomorphism. We observe that strength is not necessarily correlated to computational hardness. In summary, our work makes contributions at the foundations of an important notion of security for graphs.}

	abstract = {The use of invariants in developing security mechanisms has become an attractive research area because of their potential to both prevent attacks and detect attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In general, an invariant is a property that is expressed using design parameters along with Boolean operators and which always holds in normal operation of a system, in particular, a CPS. Invariants can be derived by analysing operational data of various design parameters in a running CPS, or by analysing the system's requirements/design documents, with both of the approaches demonstrating significant potential to detect and prevent cyber-attacks on a CPS. While data-driven invariant generation can be fully automated, design-driven invariant generation has a substantial manual intervention. In this paper, we aim to highlight the shortcomings in data-driven invariants by demonstrating a set of adversarial attacks on such invariants. We propose a solution strategy to detect such attacks by complementing them with design-driven invariants. We perform all our experiments on a real water treatment testbed. We shall demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce false positives and achieve high accuracy in attack detection on CPSs.}

	abstract = {Mitigating adversarial deep learning attacks remains challenging, partly because of the ease and low cost in carrying out such attacks. Therefore, in this article, we focus on the understanding of universal adversarial example attack on image classification models. Specifically, we seek to understand the difference(s) between adversarial examples in two adversarial datasets (DAmageNet and PGD dataset) and clean examples in ImageNet learned by the classification model, and whether we can use such findings to resist adversarial example attacks. We also seek to determine if we can retrain a discriminator to discriminate whether the input image is an adversarial example, using adversarial training. We then design a number of experiments (e.g., class activation map (CAM) analysis, feature map analysis, feature maps/filters changing, adversarial training, and binary classification model) to help us determine whether the universal adversarial dataset can be successfully used to attack the classification model. This, in turn, contributes to a better understanding of adversarial defenses over pretrained classification model from an interpretation perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the earliest works to systematically investigate the interpretation of universal adversarial example attack on image classification models, both visually and quantitatively.}

To address the issue that the medical fraud labels are insufficient in both size and classes for training a good AMFD model, this work proposes a novel Variational AutoEncoder-based Relational Model (VAERM) which can simultaneously exploit Patient-Doctor relational network and one-class fraud labels to improve the fraud detection. Then, the proposed VAERM coupled with active learning strategy can assist healthcare industry experts to conduct cost-effective fraud investigation. Finally, we propose an online model updating method to reduce the computation and memory requirement while preserving the predictive performance. The proposed framework is tested in a real world dataset and it empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both automatic fraud detection and fraud investigation tasks.}

	abstract = {Trigger set-based watermarking schemes have gained emerging attention as they provide a means to prove ownership for deep neural network model owners. In this paper, we argue that state-of-the-art trigger set-based watermarking algorithms do not achieve their designed goal of proving ownership. We posit that this impaired capability stems from two common experimental flaws that the existing research practice has committed when evaluating the robustness of watermarking algorithms: (1) incomplete adversarial evaluation and (2) overlooked adaptive attacks. We conduct a comprehensive adversarial evaluation of 11 representative watermarking schemes against six of the existing attacks and demonstrate that each of these watermarking schemes lacks robustness against at least two non-adaptive attacks. We also propose novel adaptive attacks that harness the adversary's knowledge of the underlying watermarking algorithm of a target model. We demonstrate that the proposed attacks effectively break all of the 11 watermarking schemes, consequently allowing adversaries to obscure the ownership of any watermarked model. We encourage follow-up studies to consider our guidelines when evaluating the robustness of their watermarking schemes via conducting comprehensive adversarial evaluation that includes our adaptive attacks to demonstrate a meaningful upper bound of watermark robustness.}

	abstract = {As a promising architectural design for future Internet, Named Data Networking (NDN) relies on data names, instead of destination IP addresses, to deliver data. NDN supports data authenticity and integrity by making public key signatures mandatory on data content and data names. This handles the primary security concern in NDN, but is still vulnerable to new DDoS attacks, including Cache Pollution attacks and Interest Flooding attacks, which degrade NDN transmission significantly, by violating the crucial components of NDN routers. To defend against DDoS attacks in NDN, the most effective way is to persistently detect the malicious traffic and then throttle them. Except for the usual concern of the accuracy and efficiency in attack detection, since these attacks themselves have already imposed a huge burden on victims, to avoid exhausting the remaining resources on the victims for detection purpose, a lightweight detection solution is highly desired. We study DDoS attacks and propose a persistent detection solution based on an observed malicious traffic pattern, which leverages a novel sketch to monitor the malicious traffic in a timely and lightweight way. Additionally, our analysis and experiments demonstrate that, with fixed low resource consumption, the proposed solution can persistently detect DDoS attacks in NDN.}

Evaluating and comparing IDSs with respect to their detection accuracies is thereby essential for their selection in specific use-cases. Despite a great need, hardly any labeled intrusion detection datasets are publicly available. As a consequence, evaluations are often carried out on datasets from real infrastructures, where analysts cannot control system parameters or generate a reliable ground truth, or private datasets that prevent reproducibility of results. As a solution, we present a collection of maintainable log datasets collected in a testbed representing a small enterprise. Thereby, we employ extensive state machines to simulate normal user behavior and inject a multi-step attack. For scalable testbed deployment, we use concepts from model-driven engineering that enable automatic generation and labeling of an arbitrary number of datasets that comprise repetitions of attack executions with variations of parameters. In total, we provide 8 datasets containing 20 distinct types of log files, of which we label 8 files for 10 unique attack steps. We publish the labeled log datasets and code for testbed setup and simulation online as open-source to enable others to reproduce and extend our results.}

However, it takes a proximate distance or a long time for IoT devices to sense highly correlated context with enough entropy. In this work, we present a fast and secure approach, named MPairing , to pairing multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices. This approach is based on the key idea that devices co-located within a physically-secure boundary can perceive qualified context under the help of human-in-the-loop (HITL). Specifically, we leverage received-signal-strength (RSS) trajectory data with manually-generated interference in a short period as the shared secret to achieve fast and secure pairing. Subsequently, the real-time RSS trajectory data is utilized to generate random numbers in lieu of pre-shared key (PSK), which makes our scheme more resistant to background attacks. We theoretically prove the security of our pairing scheme and implement it in real-world environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively defend against malicious devices by imposing a threshold on the similarity of RSS trajectory data. The experimental results also show that, compared with the traditional context-based pairing that takes up to 24 hours, in our scheme it takes only 10 seconds on average for a legitimate device to pass the similarity checking, which is efficient and robust.}

	abstract = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted media involves using algorithms to perform data encryption to improve the privacy of the original media and hide data for covert communication or access control. This study explores the feasibility of applying coordinate transformation and random sampling to enhance the embedding rate and total embedding capacity of separable reversible data hiding in encrypted polygonal models based on multiple most significant bit (multi-MSB) prediction and Huffman coding. We first transform each vertex coordinate value of the input model into a decimal value between 0 and 1 and then convert the value into numerous binary digits with a user-defined compression threshold. Thereafter, the random sampling concept is used to generate embeddable vertices with only partial neighboring vertices as a reference. Thus, the embedding rate and total embedding capacity can both be increased considerably. The multi-MSB prediction technique is adopted to obtain the embedding capacity of each embeddable vertex, each vertex coordinate value in the proposed study can have a respective embedding length. Finally, the auxiliary information compressed through Huffman coding and an encrypted secret message are embedded in the multi-MSB of each embeddable vertex coordinate value through bit substitution. The experimental results of this study indicate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Online Failure Prediction (OFP) allows proactively taking countermeasures before a failure occurs, such as saving data or restarting a system. However, despite its potential contribution to improving dependability, OFP still presents key limitations. Besides the problem of choosing the optimal set of features, assessing predictive models is complex and common procedures for supporting comparison are not available. There is, in fact, little work on developing and assessing failure predictors for complex systems. In this aricle, we present two extensive case studies on distinct Operating Systems (OSs), Linux and Windows, showing that it is possible to create models that can predict different types of incoming failures, highlighting various important considerations such as the operational requirements of the target system. To drive the case studies, we define a well-structured framework for a fair and sound assessment and comparison of alternative predictive solutions. It includes scenarios for choosing the most adequate metrics for the assessment, comparing alternative models, and selecting the best predictor, while considering the need to tolerate perturbations in the data. In practice, we show that, by following a well-defined process, it is possible to develop accurate failure predictors and establish a ranking of the models under evaluation in different scenarios and OSs.}

	abstract = {With the rapid developments of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the security of sensitive data has attracted more and more attention for many resource-asymmetric smart environments, such as smart home, smart agriculture and so on. The resource-asymmetry environment refers to the uneven distribution of resources on different devices side, which is specifically manifested as gateway side is resource-rich, user side and device side are resource-restricted. Hence, a secure and practical authentication key establishment scheme for such smart environments is urgently needed. Recently many researchers have designed authentication and key establishment schemes for security purpose, however most of them cannot consider the excess of gateway resources and guarantee the anonymity of user, and further, they are not suitable for resource-asymmetric smart environments because they are not lightweight enough in user side and smart device side. Due to the fact that Rabin cryptosystem has the large difference in time-consuming between encryption and decryption, it is extremely suitable for constructing authentication and key establishment scheme for resource-asymmetric smart environments. So, a new practical authentication and key establishment scheme based on the Rabin cryptosystem for resource-asymmetric smart environments is proposed, which can make better use of the advantages of abundant gateway resources and realize the lightweight operations on device side and user side, and at the same time can provide user anonymity. With Proverif and BAN logic, we can prove that our solution not only provides anonymity, but also satisfies all defined security features. Simultaneously, compared with latest similar protocols in computation cost and communication overhead, the results show that our scheme is more effective. Hence, our design has more attraction for authentication and key establishment scheme in resource-asymmetric smart environments.}

We first provide an overview of Nxt and its PoS consensus algorithm design, and introduce a concise mathematical analysis of the Nxt PoS algorithm. We then present an experimental study on the Nxt PoS behavior in a simulated environment and in a small network running Nxt private nodes. We show that the fractions of the blocks generated by forgers in the system are generally proportional to their weight in stakes provided that the weight is relatively small, which is consistent with the mathematical analysis. We consider two scenarios of double-spending attacks: (1) a single dominating forger with large stakes; and (2) a group of colluding forgers that collectively control large stakes. The simulation results show that the single-forger attack is more advantageous over using a pool of forgers in launching successful double-spending attacks. Finally, we propose a quota-based mechanism to limit the fraction of blocks that any forger could generate. We show that the mechanism is highly effective in mitigating the single-forger attack, but has limited success in preventing the double-spending attacks based on forging pools.}

In this paper, we provide new Distributed (multi) Secret Sharing Protocols for\n(k,n)\n-threshold access structures that improve on previous results, characterized by nearly-optimal storage overhead, achieving both storage optimality and a better encoding/decoding complexity. The protocols are also simpler than previous ones and allow for easier encoding.}

	abstract = {The evolution of social media has led to a trend of posting daily photos on online Social Network Platforms (SNPs). The privacy of online photos is often protected carefully by security mechanisms. However, these mechanisms will lose effectiveness when someone spreads the photos to other platforms. In this article, we propose Go-sharing, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving framework that provides powerful dissemination control for cross-SNP photo sharing. In contrast to security mechanisms running separately in centralized servers that do not trust each other, our framework achieves consistent consensus on photo dissemination control through carefully designed smart contract-based protocols. We use these protocols to create platform-free dissemination trees for every image, providing users with complete sharing control and privacy protection. Considering the possible privacy conflicts between owners and subsequent re-posters in cross-SNP sharing, we design a dynamic privacy policy generation algorithm that maximizes the flexibility of re-posters without violating formers’ privacy. Moreover, Go-sharing also provides robust photo ownership identification mechanisms to avoid illegal reprinting. It introduces a random noise black box in a two-stage separable deep learning process to improve robustness against unpredictable manipulations. Through extensive real-world simulations, the results demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the framework across a number of performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Rule-based password generation is one of the most effective and often employed techniques in the highly compute-intensive password recovery process. However, it is challenging to design and maintain a practical password mangling ruleset, which is a time-consuming task requiring specialized expertise. This paper therefore introduced MDBSCAN (Modified Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), a novel density-based cluster approach in machine learning, to build an automatic password mangling rule generator. To evaluate the proposed method, cross-checks across 4 different real-world password datasets leaked from popular Internet services and applications are adopted. The results indicate that the proposed generator could produce high-quality mangling rules with a better hit rate and enhance current mangling rules by identifying hidden or omitted rules. The proposed approach also shows strong interpretability and computational efficiency. When examining the RockYou password dataset with the top 77 rules, the hit rate may rise by 11% to 104% proportionally to other well-known solutions. Furthermore, by combining the top 77 rules generated by MDBSCAN with those from other rulesets, 3–12.67% more real-world passwords can be retrieved.}

	abstract = {Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm by collaboratively training a global model through sharing local gradients without exposing raw data. However, the shared gradients pose a threat to privacy leakage of local data. The central server may forge the aggregated results. Besides, it is common that resource-constrained devices drop out in federated learning. To solve these problems, the existing solutions consider either only efficiency, or privacy preservation. It is still a challenge to design a verifiable and lightweight secure aggregation with drop-out resilience for large-scale federated learning. In this article, we propose VOSA, an efficient verifiable and oblivious secure aggregation protocol for privacy-preserving federated learning. We exploit aggregator oblivious encryption to efficiently mask users’ local gradients. The central server performs aggregation on the obscured gradients without revealing the privacy of local data. Meanwhile, each user can efficiently verify the correctness of the aggregated results. Moreover, VOSA adopts a dynamic group management mechanism to tolerate users’ dropping out with no impact on their participation in future learning process. Security analysis shows that the VOSA can guarantee the security requirements of privacy-preserving federated learning. The extensive experimental evaluations conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed VOSA with high efficiency.}

	abstract = {As one of the most popular relational databases for embedded devices, SQLite is lightweight to be embedded into applications without installing a specific database management system. However, simplicity and easy-to-use are double-edged swords; while bringing convenience, they also make data processing and storage risky. For example, an attacker can obtain data from a database file or memory and tamper with it once he has gained higher privileges, threatening the database's confidentiality and integrity. To address such security issues, based on a trusted execution environment (TEE) and a trusted platform module (TPM), we have proposed Smaug, a general secure scheme to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of SQLite and similar databases. With Smaug, all the critical data is stored in ciphertext, and data integrity protection is also provided. Besides, with TEE, all the sensitive operations are isolated from the untrusted environment, which can effectively resist attacks against memory. In addition, we use TPM to provide a solid root-of-trust (RoT) for the system. Finally, we have implemented a prototype system, and the performance evaluations have clarified the dominant factors that affect the system availability, providing a reference to the design and implementation of similar systems.}

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to authenticated key establishment include the use of PKI or trusted third parties. While certificate deployment is sub-optimal for large-scale, low-cost applications, the use of trusted third parties is subject to human error and leaked credentials. For this context, co-location can be a valuable resource, and it is often exploited through common randomness harvesting techniques, but these, in turn, suffer from low achievable rates and usually from restrictive assumptions about the environment. Recent techniques for exploiting co-location are based on the notion of quality time and rely on sophisticated throttled clue-issuing mechanisms that allow a device with enough time to spend in the vicinity of the transmitter to find a secret key by collecting enough consecutive clues. By contrast, attackers are afforded only limited time to listen to, or interact with, the clue transmitter. Previous work in this direction deals solely with passive attackers and uses high-overhead information throttling mechanisms. This paper introduces the active attacker model for the quality-time paradigm and proposes a simple solution, a Zeroconf Key Establishment Protocol (ZeroProKeS). Additionally, the paper shows how to efficiently expand the proposed protocol to adhere to any customized information transfer function between legitimate users.}

	abstract = {Vertical federated learning (VFL) is an emerging privacy-preserving paradigm that enables collaboration between companies. These companies have the same set of users but different features. One of them is interested in expanding new business or improving its current service with others’ features. For instance, an e-commerce company, who wants to improve its recommendation performance, can incorporate users’ preferences from another corporation such as a social media company through VFL. On the other hand, graph data is a powerful and sensitive type of data widely used in industry. Their leakage, e.g., the node leakage and/or the relation leakage, can cause severe privacy issues and financial loss. Therefore, protecting the security of graph data is important in practice. Though a line of work has studied how to learn with graph data in VFL, the privacy risks remain underexplored. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study on relation inference attacks to reveal VFL's risk of leaking samples’ relations. Specifically, we assume the adversary to be a semi-honest participant. Then, according to the adversary's knowledge level, we formulate three kinds of attacks based on different intermediate representations. Particularly, we design a novel numerical approximation method to handle VFL's encryption mechanism on the participant's representations. Extensive evaluations with four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. For instance, the area under curve of relation inference can reach more than 90%, implying an impressive relation inference capability. Furthermore, we evaluate possible defenses to examine our attacks’ robustness. The results show that their impacts are limited. Our work highlights the need for advanced defenses to protect private relations and calls for more exploration of VFL's privacy and security issues.}

	abstract = {Traditional schemes for reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) focus on one data hider and cannot resist the single point of failure. Besides, the image security is determined by one party, rather than multiple parties. Thus, it is valuable to design RDH-EI schemes with multiple data hiders for stronger security. In this article, we propose a multiple data hiders-based RDH-EI scheme using a new secret sharing technique. First, we devise an\n(r,n)\n-threshold\n(r≤n)\nmatrix-based secret sharing (MSS) using matrix theory, and theoretically verify its efficacy and security properties. Then, using the MSS, we propose an\n(r,n)\n-threshold RDH-EI scheme called MSS-RDHEI. The content owner encrypts an image to be\nn\nencrypted images using the MSS with an encryption key, and outsources these encrypted images to\nn\ndata hiders. Each data hider can embed some data, e.g., copyright and identification information, into the encrypted image for the purposes of storage, management, or other processing, and these data can also be losslessly extracted. An authorized receiver can recover the confidential image from\nr\nencrypted images. By designing, our MSS-RDHEI scheme can withstand\nn−r\npoints of failure. Experimental results show that it ensures the image content confidentiality and achieves a much larger embedding capacity than state-of-the-art schemes.}

This paper presents methodologies of extracting feature set of a handwritten signature through sampling and of encoding of the samples into binary values using a tree based encoding, for generating the digital template. The results of the proposed approach are assessed in terms of strength of IP ownership proof, security against a forged signature and impact of embedding signature constraints on design cost. The results revealed that the proposed approach provides robust security at negligible design cost overhead and also outperforms state of the art hardware security approaches for DSP cores.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies have drawn a lot of attentions, and its immutability is paramount to applications requiring persistent records. However, tremendous real-world incidents have exposed the harm of strict immutability, such as the illicit data stored on Bitcoin and the loss of millions of dollars in vulnerable smart contracts. Moreover, “Right to be Forgotten” has been imposed in new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of European Union, which is incompatible with blockchain's immutability. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient redactable blockchain in a controlled way. In this paper, we present a generic design of redactable blockchain protocols in the permissionless setting, applied to both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work blockchains. Our protocol can (1) maintain the same adversary bound requirement as the underlying blockchain, (2) support various network environments, (3) offer public verifiability for any redaction, and (4) achieve instant redaction, even only within one slot in the best case, which is desirable for redacting harmful data. Furthermore, we define the first ideal protocol of redactable blockchain and conduct security analysis following the language of universal composition. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation showing that the overhead remains minimal for both online and re-spawning nodes, which demonstrates the high efficiency of our design.}

	abstract = {Rowhammer is a hardware vulnerability in DRAM memory, where repeated access to hammer rows can induce bit flips in neighboring victim rows . Rowhammer attacks have enabled privilege escalation, sandbox escape, cryptographic key disclosures, etc. A key requirement of all existing rowhammer attacks is that an attacker must have access to at least part of an exploitable hammer row. We term such rowhammer attacks as Explicit Hammer. Recently, several proposals leverage the spatial proximity between the accessed hammer rows and the location of the victim rows for a defense against rowhammer. These all aim to deny the attacker's permission to access hammer rows near sensitive data, thus defeating explicit hammer-based attacks. In this paper, we question the core assumption underlying these defenses. We present Implicit Hammer, a confused-deputy attack that causes accesses to hammer rows that the attacker is not allowed to access. It is a paradigm shift in rowhammer attacks since it crosses privilege boundary to stealthily rowhammer an inaccessible row by implicit DRAM accesses. Such accesses are achieved by abusing inherent features of modern hardware and/or software. We propose a generic model to rigorously formalize the necessary conditions to initiate implicit hammer and explicit hammer, respectively. Compared to explicit hammer, implicit hammer can defeat the advanced software-only defenses, stealthy in hiding itself and hard to be mitigated. To demonstrate the practicality of implicit hammer, we have created two implicit hammer's instances, called PThammer and SyscallHammer.}

	abstract = {Internet users are vulnerable to privacy attacks despite the use of encryption. Webpage fingerprinting, an attack that analyzes encrypted traffic, can identify the webpages visited by a user. The key challenges in performing mass-scale webpage fingerprinting arise from (i) the sheer number of combinations of user behavior and preferences to account for, and; (ii) the bound on the number of website queries imposed by the defense mechanisms (e.g., DDoS defense) deployed at the website. These constraints preclude the use of conventional data-intensive ML-based techniques. In this work, we propose Snoopy, a first-of-its-kind framework, that performs webpage fingerprinting for a large number of users visiting a website. Snoopy caters to the generalization requirements of mass-surveillance while complying with a bound on the number of website accesses (finite query model) for traffic sample collection. We show that Snoopy achieves\n≈90%\naccuracy when evaluated on most websites, across various browsing contexts. A simple ensemble of Snoopy and an ML-based technique achieves\n≈97%\naccuracy while adhering to the finite query model, in cases when Snoopy alone does not perform well.}

In this paper, we propose a set of Gray-Box attacks on PDs that an adversary may use which vary depending on the knowledge that he has about the PD. We show that these attacks severely degrade the effectiveness of several existing PDs. We then propose the concept of operation chains that iteratively map an original set of features to a new set of features and develop the “Protective Operation Chain” (\nPOC\nfor short) algorithm.\nPOC\nleverages the combination of random feature selection and feature mappings in order to increase the attacker's uncertainty about the target PD. Using 3 existing publicly available datasets plus a fourth that we have created and will release upon the publication of this article 1 , we show that\nPOC\nis more robust to these attacks than past competing work, while preserving predictive performance when no adversarial attacks are present. Moreover,\nPOC\nis robust to attacks on 13 different classifiers, not just one. These results are shown to be statistically significant at the\np<0.001\nlevel.}

	abstract = {As a popular and practical query type in location-based services, the spatial keyword query has been extensively studied in both academia and industry. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for data privacy, many privacy-preserving spatial keyword query schemes have been proposed to deal with queries over encrypted data. However, none of the existing schemes preserve access pattern privacy, and the recent research illustrates that leaking such privacy may incur inference attacks and thus disclose sensitive information. In addition, most existing schemes only consider the boolean keyword search, which is not quite practical and flexible in real-world applications. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose two privacy-preserving spatial keyword similarity query schemes that can preserve full and partial access pattern privacy, respectively. First, we present a basic privacy-preserving spatial keyword similarity query scheme (PPSKS) by integrating a secure set membership test (SSMT) technique with secure circuits. After that, to improve performance, we propose a tree-based scheme (PPSKS+) by employing a new index called FR-tree together with a predicate encryption technique that can encrypt FR-tree. Formal security analysis shows that: i) our proposed schemes can protect outsourced data, query requests, and query results; ii) our PPSKS scheme can hide full access patterns, while the PPSKS+ scheme preserves\nm\n-access pattern privacy. Extensive experiments are also conducted, and the results indicate that our tree-based PPSKS+ scheme is much more efficient, almost two orders of magnitude better than our linear search PPSKS scheme in performing queries.}

	abstract = {Whereas cryptography easily arouses attacks by means of encrypting a secret message into a suspicious form, steganography is advantageous for its resilience to attacks by concealing the message in an innocent-looking cover signal. Minimal distortion steganography, one of the mainstream steganography frameworks, embeds messages while minimizing the distortion caused by the modification on the cover elements. Due to the unavailability of the original cover signal for the receiver, message embedding is realized by finding the coset leader of the syndrome function of steganographic codes migrated from channel coding, which is complex and has limited performance. Fortunately, deep generative models and the robust semantic of generated data make it possible for the receiver to perfectly reproduce the cover signal from the stego signal. With this advantage, we propose cover-reproducible steganography where the source coding, e.g., arithmetic coding, serves as the steganographic code. Specifically, the decoding process of arithmetic coding is used for message embedding and its encoding process is regarded as message extraction. Taking text-to-speech and text-to-image synthesis tasks as two examples, we illustrate the feasibility of cover-reproducible steganography. Steganalysis experiments and theoretical analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the existing methods in most cases.}

	abstract = {Deep Learning(DL) techniques have gained significant importance in the recent past due to their vast applications. However, DL is still prone to several attacks, such as the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), based on the memorability of training data. MIA aims at determining the presence of specific data in the training dataset of the model with substitute model of similar structure to the objective model. As MIA relies on the substitute model, they can be mitigated if the substitute model is not clear about the network structure of the objective model. To solve the challenge of shadow-model construction, this work presents L-Leaks, a member inference attack based on Logits. L-Leaks allow an adversary to use the substitute model's information to predict the presence of membership if the shadow and objective model are similar enough. Here, the substitute model is built by learning the logits of the objective model, hence making it similar enough. This results in the substitute model having sufficient confidence in the member samples of the objective model. The evaluation of the attack's success shows that the proposed technique can execute the attack more accurately than existing techniques. It also shows that the proposed MIA is significantly robust under different network models and datasets.}

	abstract = {The emergence of new communication applications adds high heterogeneity to 5G-networks. With the increase of heterogeneity, handover of user equipment between different service HetNets is frequent. It must smoothly realize user-free switching to provide services continuously. Although the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed a standard protocol for this scenario, it is found that these protocols cannot satisfy key forward/backward secrecy, lacks mutual authentication, etc. Further, it can be subjected to replay, DoS and other attacks. To alleviate these problems, we propose a mask random array protocol, MRSA. For efficient, secure handover authentication in 5G HetNets, we first design a verification mechanism called mask array, which depends on a random number self-circulating encryption structure. The mechanism can not only check the identity of the communication entity but also evaluate the freshness of the message. Second, we devise the mask array-based key derivation method to ensure the whole mechanism's key security. Third, formal proof and automated analysis are established to verify the efficiency and safety of the proposed MRSA protocol. Finally, function and robustness analysis illustrate the ability to resist attacks, while the simulation base station communication analysis shows the efficiency of the protocol from three aspects of data, time and energy. MRSA has significant performance advantages compared to existing schemes in 5G HetNets.}

These techniques prevent compromising biometric data by generating and using their corresponding cancelable templates for user authentication. However, the non-invertible distance preserving transformation methods employed in various schemes are often vulnerable to information leakage since matching is performed in the transform domain. This paper proposed a non-invertible distance preserving scheme based on vector permutation and shift-order process. First, the dimension of feature vectors is reduced using kernelized principal component analysis before randomly permuting the extracted vector features. A shift-order process is then applied to the generated features to achieve non-invertibility and combat similarity correlation-based attacks. The generated hash codes are resilient to various security and privacy attacks such as ARM, masquerade, and brute-force preimage. Experimental evaluations conducted on eight fingerprint datasets from FVC2002, FVC2004, and FVC2006 reveal a high matching performance of the proposed method with better recognition accuracy than other existing state-of-the-art. The scheme also fulfills the revocability and unlinkability requirements of cancelable biometrics.}

The HT is hidden inside the transmitter modulating the sensitive information into the preamble of each transmitted frame which is used for the synchronization of the transmitter with the receiver. The data leakage does not affect synchronization and is imperceptible by the inconspicuous nominal receiver as it does not incur any performance penalty in the communication. A knowledgeable rogue receiver, however, can recover the data using signal processing that is too expensive and impractical to be used during run-time in nominal receivers. The HT mechanism is designed at circuit-level and is embedded entirely into the digital section of the RF transceiver having a tiny footprint. The proposed HT attack is demonstrated with measurements on a hardware platform. We demonstrate the stealthiness of the attack, i.e., its ability to evade defenses based on testing and run-time monitoring, and the robustness of the attack, i.e., the ability of the rogue receiver to recover the leaked information even under unfavorable channel conditions.}

	abstract = {Digital certificates play an important role in the authentication of communicating parties for transport layer security. Recently, however, frequent incidents such as the illegal issuance of fake certificates by a compromised certificate authority have raised concerns about the legacy certificate system. Certificate Transparency (CT) mitigates such issues by employing a log server to audit issued certificates publicly, making the certificate issuance and verification processes transparent. Unfortunately, the legacy CT ecosystem suffers from log server compromises and user browsing information leakage. Furthermore, the data structure for the certificate management in the legacy CT system incurs computation overhead linear to the number of registered certificates in the log. In this paper, we propose a secure CT scheme by leveraging a shared value tree (SVT), a novel log structure specifically designed to address the log server compromise and browsing information leakage problems. The verification time of SVT remains constant regardless of the number of registered certificates in the log. We analyze our scheme on the legacy CT system to demonstrate its incremental deployability, guaranteeing a smooth transition toward a more secure web ecosystem.}

It is attractive for the merits of checking the validity of the queried data and detecting the malicious actions of tampering with the outsourced database concurrently. However, the database in the context of VDB is merely suitable to store a fixed-size dataset. Hence, VDB is inapplicable to the unbounded-size database that provides the capability to store and manage the arbitrary-size datasets in the incremental manners. To circumvent the weaknesses, we research on the verifiable unbounded-size database with update (VUSDB). The VUSDB is sufficient for multiple clients to store their own arbitrary-size datasets in the database that has already contained some datasets. In order to design a VUSDB scheme, we first put forward a primitive called authenticated matrix commitment and give a scheme. This primitive is qualified to commit to a collection of ordered data represented in the form of matrix, and assure the ownership of the opened data. Then we utilize the authenticated matrix commitment scheme to construct a VUSDB scheme. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed schemes are efficient and practical.}

	abstract = {Fingerprinting Internet-of-Things(IoT) devices on types and brands is a necessary work for security analysis in the cyberspace. The existing approaches mainly rely on the dominant features of devices which is response to information in order to identify these online devices. However, the web server components reusing and products rebranding are the common phenomenons of these embedded IoT devices. It caused the existing approaches difficult to identify most devices even errors due to the similar responses. In this paper, we present an approach, IoTXray, which improves the work efficiently of information collection about accelerating the relations between reusing/rebranding devices with the corresponding manufacturers. And these relations can generate more accurate and reliable fingerprints than previous approaches. Using the mixed neural networks, IoTXray comprehensively detects the real manufactures of online IoT devices upon three different kinds of data sources. In the experiment, our approach can identify 7,025,854 IoT devices on HTTP-hosts. The identification rate has reached to several times higher than previous approaches. Our approach has especially detected 3,268,953 reusing and 963,653 rebranding devices with their original manufacturers.}

	abstract = {In order to remain competitive, Internet companies collect and analyse user data for the purpose of the improvement of user experiences. Frequency estimation is a widely used statistical tool, which could potentially conflict with the relevant privacy regulations. Privacy preserving analytic methods based on differential privacy have been proposed, which require either a large user base or a trusted server. Although the requirements for such solutions may not be a problem for larger companies, they may be unattainable for smaller organizations. To address this issue, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving sampling-based frequency estimation method which has high accuracy even in the scenario with a small number of users while not requiring any trusted server. This is achieved by combining multi-party computation and sampling techniques. We also provide a relation between its privacy guarantee, output accuracy, and the number of participants. Distinct from most existing methods, our methods achieve centralized differential privacy guarantee without the need of any trusted server. We established that, even for a small number of participants, our mechanisms can produce estimates with high accuracy and hence they provide smaller companies with more opportunity for growth through privacy-preserving statistical analysis. We further propose an architectural model to support weighted aggregation in order to achieve a higher accuracy estimate to cater for users with varying privacy requirements. Compared to the unweighted aggregation, our method provides a more accurate estimate. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

We examine the protection potency of sanitized multi-dimensional frequency distributions (FDs) via DP mechanisms against homogeneity attack (HA). Adversaries can obtain the exact values on sensitive attributes of their targets through HA without having to identify them from released data. We propose measures for disclosure risk (DR) from HA and derive closed-form relations between the privacy loss parameters and DR from HA. The availability of the closed-form relations will assist practitioners in understanding the abstract concepts of DP and privacy loss parameters by putting them in the context of a concrete privacy attack and offer a perspective for choosing privacy loss parameters when employing DP mechanisms. We apply the derived mathematical relations in real data to demonstrate the assessment of DR from HA on differentially privately sanitized FDs at various privacy loss parameters. The results suggest that relations between DR from HA and privacy loss are S-shaped; the former may not disappear even when privacy loss approaches 0.}

	abstract = {With the appearance of electric energy market deregulation, there exists a growing concern over the potential privacy leakage of commercial data among competing power companies where data sharing is essential in the applications such as smart grid state estimation. Most of the existing solutions are either perturbation-based or conventional cryptography-based where a trusted central 3rd party would often be required. This article proposes privacy-preserving state estimation protocols for DC and AC models. The proposed idea is to distribute the overall task of the system state estimation into sub-tasks which can be performed by local sub-grid operators with their private data. A masking method is designed inside a homomorphic encryption scheme which is then used to ensure both the input and output data privacy during the collaboration process among individual sub-task players. Security is achieved via the computationally indistinguishable post-quantum security guaranteed by a levelled homomorphic encryption scheme over real numbers and the differential privacy of the output estimated states provided by the Laplace mechanism perturbation integrated into the masking linear transformation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of our proposed privacy-preserving system state estimation protocols.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threats (APT) have increased in recent times as a result of the rise in interest by nation-states and sophisticated corporations to obtain high-profile information. Typically, APT attacks are more challenging to detect since they leverage zero-day attacks and common benign tools. Furthermore, these attack campaigns are often prolonged to evade detection. We leverage an approach that uses a provenance graph to obtain execution traces of host nodes in order to detect anomalous behavior. By using the provenance graph, we extract features that are then used to train an online adaptive metric learning. Online metric learning is a deep learning method that learns a function to minimize the separation between similar classes and maximizes the separation between dis- similar instances. We compare our approach with baseline models and we show our method outperforms the baseline models by increasing detection accuracy on average by 11.3% and increases True positive rate (TPR) on average by 18.3%. We also show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art models performances in comprehensive attack datasets in both binary and multi-class settings.}

	abstract = {Speaker recognition systems (SRSs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising significant security concerns. In this work, we systematically investigate transformation and adversarial training based defenses for securing SRSs. According to the characteristic of SRSs, we present 22 diverse transformations and thoroughly evaluate them using 7 recent promising adversarial attacks (4 white-box and 3 black-box) on speaker recognition. With careful regard for best practices in defense evaluations, we analyze the strength of transformations to withstand adaptive attacks. We also evaluate and understand their effectiveness against adaptive attacks when combined with adversarial training. Our study provides thirteen useful insights and findings, many of them are new or inconsistent with the conclusions in the image and speech recognition domains, e.g., variable and constant bit rate speech compressions have different performance, and some non-differentiable transformations remain effective against current promising evasion techniques which often work well in the image domain. We demonstrate that the proposed novel feature-level transformation combined with adversarial training is rather effective compared to the sole adversarial training in a complete white-box setting, e.g., increasing the accuracy by 13.62% and attack cost by two orders of magnitude, while other transformations do not necessarily improve the overall defense capability. This work sheds further light on the research directions in this field. We also release our evaluation platform SpeakerGuard to foster further research.}

	abstract = {By collecting and analyzing patients' e-healthcare data in Medical Internet-of-Things (MIOT), e-Healthcare providers can offer alternative and helpful evaluation services of the risk of diseases to patients. However, e-Healthcare providers cannot cope with the huge volumes of data and respond to this online service. Providers typically outsource medical data to powerful medical cloud servers. Since outsourced servers are not fully trusted, a direct evaluation service will inevitably result in privacy risks concerning the patient's identity or original medical data. It is hard to hide the results of an evaluation from the single-server model unless a fully homomorphic cryptosystem is used or the patients must communicate online with the cloud multiple times in an inefficient manner. With regards to these issues, this article proposes a S ecure and P rivacy- P reserving D ecision T ree E valuation scheme (namely SPP-DTE) to achieve secure disease diagnosis classification under e-Healthcare systems without revealing the sensitive information of patients such as physiological data or the private data of medical providers such as the structure of decision trees. Our proposed scheme uses modified KNN computation to match the similarity and preserve the confidentiality of raw data and also applies matrix randomization and monotonically increasing and one-way functions to confuse the intermediate results . The experiment is conducted in data sets from UCI machine learning repository of medical health data. Our analysis indicates that the proposed SPP-DTE scheme is efficient in terms of computational cost and communication overhead that is practical and efficient for privacy protection in e-Healthcare classification and diagnosis system.}

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are expected to continue plaguing service availability in emerging networks which rely on distributed edge clouds to offer critical, latency-sensitive applications. However, edge servers increase the network attack surface, which is exacerbated with the massive number of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that can be weaponized to launch DDoS attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to detect DDoS attacks early, i.e., at the network edge. In this paper, we empower the network edge with intelligent DDoS detection by learning from similarities between different data and DDoS attacks available across the edge servers. To this end, we develop a novel Outlier Exposure (OE)-enabled cross-silo Federated Learning framework, namely FedOE. FedOE enables distributed training of OE-based ML models using a limited number of labeled outliers (i.e., attack flows) experienced at edge servers. We propose a novel OE-based Autoencoder (oAE) that can better discriminate anomalies in comparison to the widely adopted traditional Autoencoder, using a tailored, OE-based loss function. We evaluate oAE in FedOE and demonstrate its ability to generalize to zero-day attacks, with just 50 labeled attack flows per edge server. The results show that oAE achieves a high F1-score for most DDoS attacks, outclassing its non-OE counterpart.}

	abstract = {Audio recordings used as evidence have become increasingly important to litigation. Before their admissibility as evidence, an audio forensic expert is often required to help determine whether the submitted audio recordings are altered or authentic. Within this field, the copy-move forgery detection (CMFD), which focuses on finding possible forgeries that are derived from the same audio recording, has been an urgent problem in blind audio forensics. However, most of the existing methods require idealistic pre-segmentation and artificial threshold selection to calculate the similarity between segments, which may result in serious misleading and misjudgment especially on high frequency words. In this work, we present a robust method for detecting and locating an audio copy-move forgery on the basis of constant Q spectral sketches (CQSS) and the integration of a customised genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, the CQSS features are first extracted by averaging the logarithm of the squared-magnitude constant Q transform. Then, the CQSS feature set is automatically optimised by a customised GA combined with SVM to obtain the best feature subset and classification model at the same time. Finally, the integrated method, named CQSS-GA-SVM, is evaluated against the state-of-the-art approaches to blind detection of copy-move forgeries on real-world copy-move datasets with read English and Chinese corpus, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CQSS-GA-SVM exhibits significantly high robustness against post-processing based anti-forensics attacks and adaptability to the changes of the duplicated segment duration, the training set size, the recording length, and the forgery type, which may be beneficial to improving the work efficiency of audio forensic experts.}

The deployment of resource-limited devices and the use of a wide range of technologies expand the attack surface and position the smart home as a target for many potential security threats. Access control is among the top security challenges in smart home IoT. Several access control models have been developed or adapted for IoT in general, with a few specifically designed for the smart home IoT domain. Most of these models are built on the role-based access control (RBAC) model or the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. However, recently some researchers demonstrated that the need arises for a hybrid model combining ABAC and RBAC, thereby incorporating the benefits of both models to better meet IoT access control challenges in general and smart homes requirements in particular. In this paper, we used two approaches to develop two different hybrid models for smart home IoT. We followed a role-centric approach and an attribute-centric approach to develop HyBAC\nRC\nand HyBAC\nAC\n, respectively. We formally define these models and illustrate their features through a use case scenario demonstration. We further provide a proof-of-concept implementation for each model in Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT platform. Finally, we conduct a theoretical comparison between the two models proposed in this paper in addition to the EGRBAC model (RBAC model for smart home IoT) and HABAC model (ABAC model for smart home IoT), which were previously developed to meet smart homes’ challenges.}

	abstract = {Traditional data access control schemes only prevent unauthorized access to private data with a single owner. They are not suitable for application in a Multi-Level Data Processing (MLDP) scenario, where data are processed by a series of parties who also insert new data. Hence, the accumulated dataset should be protected through access control handled by hierarchically-structured parties who are at least partial data owners in MLDP. Existing multi-owner access control schemes mainly focus on controlling access to co-owned data of multiple entities with the equal ownership, but seldom investigates how to apply access control in MLDP. In this paper, we base the off-the-shelf Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Intel SGX, to propose an Efficient and Secure Multi-owner Access Control scheme (ESMAC) for access authorization in MLDP. Moreover, to prevent unauthorized data disclosure by non-root data owners aiming to gain extra profits, we further introduce undercover polices to supervise their behaviors. Specifically, we design a data protection scheme based on game theory to decide the payoffs and punishments of honest and dishonest data owners, which motivates data owners to behave honestly when claiming ownership over data. Through comprehensive security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate ESMAC's security and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Calculating system damage caused by a cyberattack can help in understanding the impact and destructiveness of the attack to discover system security weaknesses. Thus, system damage calculations is important in the process of network offense–defense confrontation. However, there is little research on attack damage calculation. Current methods are unable to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an attack in a rational and accurate way. The lack of theoretical support and the complexity of both cyber systems and attacks bring tremendous challenges to attack damage calculations. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ADCaDeM to enable quantitative attack damage calculation based on a differential manifold. The damage is a negative utility produced by attack behaviors on an attacked object, which can be characterized and expressed by its attributes. We formally map the attack behaviors into a space constructed by the attributes of the attacked object in a mathematical way. Then, we propose an algorithm to construct these attributes as a differential manifold to represent their algebraic topological structure. According to the theory of tangent vectors and geodesics on the differential manifold, we can calculate attack behavioral utility in a physical way, such as computing the work done in physics. Regardless of the complexity of the dimensional structure of the attributes, the differential manifold structure can reasonably represent and calculate the damage caused by an attack. We simulate a data theft attack and a web penetration attack to test the performance of ADCaDeM and compare it with existing methods. Our experimental results illustrate ADCaDeM's advance in terms of rationality for calculating the damage caused by some typical cyberattacks.}

	abstract = {Network covert timing channels can be maliciously used to exfiltrate secrets, coordinate attacks and propagate malwares, posing serious threats to cybersecurity. Current covert timing channels normally conduct small-volume transmission under the covers of various disguising techniques, making them hard to detect especially when a detector has little priori knowledge of their traffic features. In this article, we propose a generic and sensitive detection approach, which can simultaneously (i) identify various types of channels without their traffic knowledge and (ii) maintain reasonable performance on small traffic samples. The basis of our approach is the finding that the short-term timing behavior of covert and legitimate traffic is significantly different from the perspective of inter-packet delays’ variation. This phenomenon can be a generic reference to detect various channels because it is resistant to major channel disguising techniques which only mimic long-term traffic features, while it is also a sensitive reference to spot small-volume covert transmission since it can capture traffic anomalies in a fine-grained manner. To obtain the inner patterns of inter-packet delays’ variation, we design a context-sensitive feature-extraction technique. This technique transforms each raw inter-packet delay into a discrete counterpart based on its contextual properties, thus extracting its variation features and reducing traffic data complexity. Then we learn legitimate variation patterns using a neural network model, and identify samples showing anomalous variation as covert. The experimental results show that our approach effectively detects all currently representative channels in the absence of their knowledge, presenting once to twice higher sensitivity than the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving pattern matching enables a user to find all occurrences of a pattern in a text without revealing any sensitive information. However, many previous works designed on homomorphic encryption suffer from expensive computational overhead and a simple way to use it can lead to potential input leakage via access pattern during the matching process. In this article, we propose a differentially oblivious pattern matching algorithm, called DOPM . It is deployed on two servers by taking a series of lightweight secret-sharing-based protocols as building blocks. In DOPM , we utilize a witness array and the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) technique to parallelize the algorithm, which achieves sublinear round complexity in performing two-party computation. Additionally, we formally define a new access pattern privacy in the context of differential privacy, named (\\epsilon,\\delta)\n-differentially oblivious privacy ( (\\epsilon,\\delta)\n-DOP), and present a pair of differentially oblivious algorithms to read and write elements in an array without using oblivious shuffle. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that the proposed DOPM achieves the goal of protecting confidentiality and access pattern during the matching process. Finally, we benchmark our scheme on a real-world human genome dataset, and experimental results show that DOPM is 10.9\\times\nfaster than the brute-force matching, 3.4-7.1\\times\nfaster than two state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Recently, generative steganography that transforms secret information to a generated image has been a promising technique to resist steganalysis detection. However, due to the inefficiency and irreversibility of the secret-to-image transformation, it is hard to find a good trade-off between the information hiding capacity and extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a secret-to-image reversible transformation (S2IRT) scheme for generative steganography. The proposed S2IRT scheme is based on a generative model, i.e., Glow model, which enables a bijective-mapping between latent space with multivariate Gaussian distribution and image space with a complex distribution. In the process of S2I transformation, guided by a given secret message, we construct a latent vector and then map it to a generated image by the Glow model, so that the secret message is finally transformed to the generated image. Owing to good efficiency and reversibility of S2IRT scheme, the proposed steganographic approach achieves both high hiding capacity and accurate extraction of secret message from generated image. Furthermore, a separate encoding-based S2IRT (SE-S2IRT) scheme is also proposed to improve the robustness to common image attacks. The experiments demonstrate the proposed steganographic approaches can achieve high hiding capacity (up to 4 bpp ) and accurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate) simultaneously, while maintaining desirable anti-detectability and imperceptibility.}

	abstract = {Instant Messaging (IM) applications such as Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp have become tremendously popular in recent years. Unfortunately, such IM services have been targets of governmental surveillance and censorship, as these services are home to public and private communications on socially and politically sensitive topics. To protect their clients, popular IM services deploy state-of-the-art encryption. Despite the use of advanced encryption, we show that popular IM applications leak sensitive information about their clients to adversaries merely monitoring their encrypted IM traffic, with no need for leveraging any software vulnerabilities of IM applications. Specifically, we devise traffic analysis attacks enabling an adversary to identify participants of target IM communications (e.g., forums) with high accuracies. We believe that our study demonstrates a significant, real-world threat to the users of such services. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks through extensive experiments on real-world IM communications. We show that standard countermeasure techniques can degrade the effectiveness of these attacks. We hope our study will encourage IM providers to integrate effective traffic obfuscation into their software. In the meantime, we have designed a countermeasure system, called IMProxy that can be used by IM clients with no need for any support from IM providers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMProxy through simulation and experiments.}

	abstract = {Researchers have discovered a series of theoretical attacks against Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus; the most damaging ones are selfish mining, double-spending, and consistency delay attacks. These attacks have one common cause: block withholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates to resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees from miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set of signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has to publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block withholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee election in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a reward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and evaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and double-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the total computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a probability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the success probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal end-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be introduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that prevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety proof.}

These algorithms compute relevant security metrics, i.e., performance indicators that quantify how good the security of a system is; typical metrics being the most likely attack, the cheapest, or the most damaging one. However, existing methods are only geared towards specific metrics or do not work on general attack trees. This article classifies attack trees in two dimensions: proper trees versus directed acyclic graphs (i.e., with shared subtrees); and static versus dynamic gates. For three out of these four classes, we propose novel algorithms that work over a generic attribute domain, encompassing a large number of concrete security metrics defined on the attack tree semantics; dynamic attack trees with directed acyclic graph structure are left as an open problem. We also analyse the computational complexity of our methods.}

	abstract = {Recent works have revealed that backdoor attacks against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) could lead to abnormal action selections of the agent, which may result in failure or even catastrophe in crucial decision processes. However, existing attacks only consider single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) systems, in which the only agent can observe the global state and have full control of the decision process. In this article, we explore a new backdoor attack paradigm in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL) scenarios, where a group of agents coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal, while each agent can only observe the local state. In the proposed MARNet attack framework, we carefully design a pipeline of trigger design, action poisoning, and reward hacking modules to accommodate the cooperative multi-agent settings. In particular, as only a subset of agents can observe the triggers in their local observations, we maneuver their actions to the worst actions suggested by an expert policy model. Since the global reward in CMARL is aggregated by individual rewards from all agents, we propose to modify the reward in a way that boosts the bad actions of poisoned agents (agents who observe the triggers) but mitigates the influence on non-poisoned agents. We conduct extensive experiments on three classical CMARL algorithms VDN, COMA, and QMIX, in two popular CMARL games Predator Prey and SMAC. The results show that the baselines extended from single-agent DRL backdoor attacks seldom work in CMARL problems while MARNet performs well by reducing the utility under attack by nearly 100%. We apply fine-tuning as a potential defense against MARNet and demonstrate that fine-tuning cannot entirely eliminate the effect of the attack.}

	abstract = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) can serve as a technical solution to secure data in applications that rely on cloud storage. The key features of an RDHEI scheme are reversibility, security, and data embedding rate. To enlarge the embedding rate, this paper proposes a novel RDHEI scheme based on the median edge detector (MED) and a new proposed hierarchical block variable length coding (HBVLC) technique. In our scheme, the image owner first predicts the pixel values of the carrier image with MED. Then, the prediction error array is sliced into bit-planes and encoded plane by plane. By leveraging the inherent features of the prediction error bit-planes, the image owner adaptively decomposes a bit-plane into blocks of different hierarchical levels based on its local smoothness and encodes the blocks with a variable length coding method. As a result, the carrier image is efficiently compressed to provide spare room for data embedding. The encoded carrier image is then processed with the conventional steps of an RDHEI technique. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only can restore the secret data and the carrier image without loss but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the embedding rate for images with various features.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a specialized type of deep learning models on graphs by learning aggregations over neighbor nodes. However, recent studies reveal that the performance of GNNs are severely deteriorated by injecting adversarial examples. Hence, improving the robustness of GNNs is of significant importance. Prior works are devoted to reducing the influence of direct adversaries which are adversarial attacks by positioning a node's one-hop neighbors, yet these approaches are limited in protecting GNNs from indirect adversarial attacks within a node's multi-hop neighbors. In this work, we approach this problem from a new angle by exploring the graph Ricci curvature, which can characterize the relationships of both direct and indirect links from any two nodes’ neighborhoods in the Riemannian space. We first investigate the distinguishable properties of adversarial attacks with graph Ricci curvature distribution. Then, a novel defense framework called Cure-GNN is proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial effects. Cure-GNN discerns the distinction between adversarial edges and normal edges via computing curvature, and merges it into the node features reconstructed by a residual learning framework. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets on node classification task demonstrate the efficacy of Cure-GNN and achieves superiority to the state-of-the-arts without incurring high complexity.}

	abstract = {Albeit the popularity of federated learning (FL), recently emerging model-inversion and poisoning attacks arouse extensive concerns towards privacy or model integrity, which catalyzes the developments of secure federated learning (SFL) methods. Nonetheless, the collisions between its privacy and integrity, two equally crucial elements in collaborative learning scenarios, are relatively underexplored. Individuals’ wish to “hide in the crowd” for privacy frequently clashes with aggregators’ need to resist abnormal participants for integrity (i.e., the incompatibility between Byzantine robustness and differential privacy). The dilemma prompts researchers to reflect on how to build mutual confidence between individuals and aggregators. Against the backdrop, this paper proposes a multi-shuffler secure federated learning (MSFL) framework, based on which we further propound three modules (hierarchical shuffling mechanism, malice evaluation module, and composite defense strategy) to jointly guarantee strong privacy protection, efficient poisoning resistance, and agile adversary elimination. Extensive experiments on standard datasets exhibited the method's effectiveness in thwarting different FL poisoning attack paradigms with a minimal cost of privacy breaches.}

To produce more accurate models, powerful third parties (e.g., clouds) are usually employed to collect data from a large number of users, which however may raise concerns about user privacy. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Privacy-preserving Neural Network scheme, named EPNN, to deal with the privacy issues in cloud-based neural networks. EPNN is designed based on a two-cloud model and techniques of data perturbation and additively homomorphic cryptosystem. This scheme enables two clouds to cooperatively perform neural network training and prediction in a privacy-preserving manner and significantly reduces the computation and communication overhead among participating entities. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate the security of EPNN. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show EPNN is more efficient than existing schemes in terms of computational costs and communication overhead.}

Existing privacy-preserving methods such as hash function and fuzzy commitment are not cancelable, where raw biometric features are vulnerable to hill-climbing attacks. To address this issue, we propose the PolyCosGraph, a system based on Poly nomial transformation embedding Cos ine functions with Graph features of EEG signals, which is a privacy-preserving and cancelable template design that protects EEG features and system security against multiple attacks. In addition, a template corrupting process is designed to further enhance the security of the system, and a corresponding matching algorithm is developed. Even when the transformed template is compromised, attackers cannot retrieve raw EEG features and the compromised template can be revoked. The proposed system achieves the authentication performance of 1.49% EER with a resting state protocol, 0.68% EER with a motor imagery task, and 0.46% EER under a watching movie condition, which is equivalent to that in the non-encrypted domain. Security analysis demonstrates that our system is resistant to attacks via record multiplicity, preimage attacks, hill-climbing attacks, second attacks and brute force attacks.}

	abstract = {Cloud-hosted applications are prone to targeted attacks such as DDoS, advanced persistent threats, Cryptojacking which threaten service availability. Recently, methods for threat information sharing and defense require cooperation and trust between multiple domains/entities. There is a need for mechanisms that establish distributed trust to allow for such a collective defense. In this paper, we present a novel threat intelligence sharing and defense system, namely “DefenseChain,” to allow organizations to have incentive-based and trustworthy cooperation to mitigate the impact of cyber attacks. Our solution approach features a consortium Blockchain platform and an economic model to obtain threat data and select suitable peers to help with attack detection and mitigation. We apply DefenseChain in the financial technology industry for an insurance claim processing use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of DefenseChain in a real-world application setting. Our evaluation experiments with DefenseChain implementation are performed on an Open Cloud testbed with Hyperledger Composer and in a simulation environment. Our results show that the DefenseChain system overall performs better than state-of-the-art decision making schemes in choosing the most appropriate detector and mitigator peers. Lastly, we validate how DefenseChain helps mitigate the threat risk of incidents relating to potential fraudulent insurance claims or cyber attacks.}

	abstract = {The FIDO protocol suite aims at allowing users to log in to remote services with a local and trusted authenticator. With FIDO, relying services do not need to store user-chosen secrets or their hashes, which eliminates a major attack surface for e-business. Given its increasing popularity, it is imperative to formally analyze whether the security promises of FIDO hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and formal verification of the FIDO UAF protocol by formalizing its security assumptions and goals and modeling the protocol under different scenarios in ProVerif. Our analysis identifies the minimal security assumptions required for each of the security goals of FIDO UAF to hold. We confirm previously manually discovered vulnerabilities in an automated way and disclose several new attacks. Guided by the formal verification results, we also discovered two practical attacks on two popular Android FIDO apps, which we responsibly disclosed to the vendors. In addition, we offer several concrete recommendations to fix the identified problems and weaknesses in the protocol.}

	abstract = {Privacy preservation is highly expected in the Bitcoin Network. However, only applying pseudonyms cannot completely ensure anonymity/unlinkability between payers and payees. Current approaches mainly depend on a mixer service, which obfuscates payer-payee relationships of transactions. While the mixer service improves transaction privacy, it still suffers from some severe security threats (e.g., DoS attack and collusion attack), and does not support effective and reliable off-chain payment in a parallel mode. In this article, we propose a mixing protocol for the Bitcoin Network based on zero-knowledge proof, called SofitMix. It is the first mixing protocol that can effectively resist both the DoS attack and the collusion attack. It can also support a set of parallel off-chain payments in a reliable way no matter whether some payers abort a transaction. We analyze and prove SofitMix security following the Universal Composability model with regard to fair exchange, unlinkability, collusion-resistance, DoS-resistance and Sybil-resistance. Through a proof-of-concept implementation, we demonstrate its validity and fairness. We also show its advance on off-chain payment reliability and DoS attack resistance, compared to TumbleBit.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices upload their data into the cloud for storage because of their limited resources. However, cloud storage data has been subject to potential integrity threats, and consequently auditing techniques are demanded to ensure the integrity of stored data. Unfortunately, existing auditing approaches require owners to undertake expensive tag calculations, which is unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. To resolve the issue, we present a F air C loud A uditing proposal by employing the B lockchain (FCAB). We combine certificateless signatures with the designed dynamic structure to constructively offload the cost of tag computation from the IoT device to the introduced fog node, significantly reducing the local burden. Considering that fog nodes may behave dishonestly during auditing, FCAB enables the IoT device to verify the audit result's authenticity by extracting reliable checking records from the blockchain, thereby achieving auditing fairness, which ensures that the honest cloud and fog node will gain the corresponding reward. Finally, FCAB is proved to satisfy tag unforgeability, proof unforgeability, privacy preserving, and auditing fairness. Experiment evaluations affirm that FCAB is computationally and communicationally efficient and retains a smaller and fixed computation locally at the data processing stage (mainly including tag computation) than existing auditing methods.}

In this work, through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we reveal two major shortcomings in the current SB infrastructure. First, we derive a feasible tracking technique for industry best practice. We show that the current mitigation techniques cannot eliminate the threat of de-anonymization permanently. Second, we gauge the effectiveness of blacklists provided by major vendors. Our discovery indicates the urge for blacklist integration in order to boost service quality. In light of this, we propose a new three-party paradigm\nPEBA\nwith an intermediate third party decoupling the direct interaction of users and proprietary blacklist vendors. To satisfy practical usage requirements, we instantiate our design with trusted hardware, detailing how it can be leveraged to fulfill the requirements of privacy enhancement and broader content coverage at the same time. We also tackle numerous implementation challenges that emerged from this proxy-based and hardware-enabled solution. Extensive evaluation confirms that\nPEBA\ncan balance well among desirable goals of security, usability, performance, and elasticity, making it suitable for deployment in practice.}

	abstract = {Due to the explosive increase of enterprise network traffic, middleboxes that inspect packets through customized rules have been widely outsourced for cost-saving. Despite promising, redirecting enterprise traffic to remote middleboxes raises privacy concerns about the exposure of corporate secrets. To address this, existing solutions mainly apply searchable encryption (SE) to encrypt traffic and rules, enabling middlebox to perform pattern matching over ciphertexts without learning any sensitive information. However, SE is designed for searching pre-chosen keywords, and may cause extensive costs when applied directly to inspecting traffic in which the keywords cannot be determined in advance. The inefficiency of existing SE-based approaches motivates us to investigate a privacy-preserving and lightweight middlebox. To this end, this paper designs\nSlimBox\n, which rapidly screens out potentially malicious packets in constant time while incurring only moderate communication overhead. Our main idea is to fragment a traffic/rule string into sub-patterns to achieve conjunctive sub-pattern matching over ciphertexts, while incorporating the position information into the secure matching process to avoid false positives. Experiment results on real datasets show that\nSlimBox\ncan achieve a good tradeoff between matching latency and communication cost compared to prior work.}

	abstract = {Payment channel networks (PCNs) are considered as a prominent solution for scaling blockchain, where users can establish payment channels and complete transactions in an off-chain manner. However, it is non-trivial to schedule transactions in PCNs and most existing routing algorithms suffer from the following challenges: 1) one-shot optimization, 2) privacy-invasive channel probing, 3) vulnerability to DoS attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-aware transaction scheduling algorithm with defence against DoS attacks based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), namely PTRD. Specifically, considering both the privacy preservation and long-term throughput into the optimization criteria, we formulate the transaction-scheduling problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process. We then design PTRD, which extends off-the-shelf DRL algorithms to constrained optimization with an additional cost critic-network and an adaptive Lagrangian multiplier. Moreover, considering the distribution nature of PCNs, in which each user schedules transactions independently, we develop a distributed training framework to collect the knowledge learned by each agent so as to enhance learning effectiveness. With the customized network design and the distributed training framework, PTRD achieves a good balance between the optimization of the throughput and the minimization of privacy risks. Evaluations show that PTRD outperforms the state-of-the-art PCN routing algorithms by 2.7%–62.5% in terms of the long-term throughput while satisfying privacy constraints.}

	abstract = {The advance of cloud computing has driven an emerging trend of outsourcing the rapidly growing data and query services to a powerful cloud for easing the local storage and computing pressure. Meanwhile, when taking data privacy into account, data are usually outsourced to the cloud in an encrypted form. As a result, query services have to be performed over the encrypted data. Among all kinds of query services, the reverse kNN query is highly popular in various applications, such as taxi dispatching and targeted push of multimedia information, but its privacy has not received sufficient attention. To our best knowledge, many existing privacy-preserving reverse kNN query schemes still have some limitations on the query result accuracy, dataset privacy, and flexible support for the choice of the query object and the parameter k. Aiming at addressing these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving reverse kNN query scheme over encrypted data, named PRkNN. Specifically, we first design a modified M-tree (MM-tree) to index the dataset and further present an MM-Tree based reverse kNN query algorithm in the filter and refinement framework. Then, we leverage the lightweight matrix encryption to carefully design a filter predicate encryption scheme (FPE) and a refinement predicate encryption scheme (RPE); and propose our PRkNN scheme by applying them to protect the privacy of the MM-Tree based reverse kNN query algorithm. Detailed security analysis shows that FPE and RPE schemes are selectively secure, and our PRkNN scheme can preserve both query privacy and dataset privacy. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our scheme, and the results demonstrate that our scheme is efficient.}

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems and their smart components have a pervasive presence in all our daily activities. Unfortunately, identifying the potential threats and issues in these systems and selecting enough protection is challenging given that such environments combine human, physical and cyber aspects to the system design and implementation. Current threat models and analysis do not take into consideration all three aspects of the analyzed system, how they can introduce new vulnerabilities or protection measures to each other. In this work, we introduce a novel threat model for cyber-physical systems that combines the cyber, physical, and human aspects. Our model represents the system's components relations and security properties by taking into consideration these three aspects. Together with the threat model we also propose a threat analysis method that allows understanding the security state of the system's components. The threat model and the threat analysis have been implemented into an automatic tool, called TAMELESS, that automatically analyzes threats to the system, verifies its security properties, and generates a graphical representation, useful for security architects to identify the proper prevention/mitigation solutions. We show and prove the use of our threat model and analysis with three cases studies from different sectors.}

We present Hercules , an efficient and high-precision training framework that can tolerate collusion of up to\nN−1\nusers. Hercules follows the POSEIDON framework proposed by Sav et al. (NDSS’21), but makes a qualitative leap in performance with the following contributions: (i) we design a novel parallel homomorphic computation method for matrix operations, which enables fast Single Instruction and Multiple Data (SIMD) operations over ciphertexts. For the multiplication of two\nh×h\ndimensional matrices, our method reduces the computation complexity from\nO(\nh\n3\n)\nto\nO(h)\n. This greatly improves the training efficiency of the neural network since the ciphertext computation is dominated by the convolution operations; (ii) we present an efficient approximation on the sign function based on the composite polynomial approximation. It is used to approximate non-polynomial functions (i.e., ReLU and max ), with the optimal asymptotic complexity. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets (BCW, ESR, CREDIT, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) show that compared with POSEIDON, Hercules obtains up to 4% increase in model accuracy, and up to\n60×\nreduction in the computation and communication cost.}

	abstract = {Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs) are approximate membership checking data structures, and it is normally believed that at most an approximate reconstruction of the underlying set can be derived when interacting with a CBF. This paper decisively refutes this assumption. In a recent paper, we considered the privacy of CBFs when the attacker has access to the implementation details and thus, it sees the filter as a white-box. In that setting, we showed that the attacker may be able to extract the elements stored in the filter when the number of false positives over the entire universe is not significantly larger than the number of elements stored in the filter. In this work, we consider a black-box attacker that can only perform user interactions on the CBF to insert, remove and query elements with no knowledge of the filter implementation details. We show that even in this case, an attacker may be able to extract information from the filter at the cost of using more complex and time-consuming attack algorithms. The proposed algorithms have been implemented and compared with the white-box attack, showing that in most cases, almost the same information can be extracted from the filter.}

	abstract = {Natural forking is tantamount to the “black swan” event in blockchain since it emerges unexpectedly with a small probability, and may incur low resource utilization and costly economic loss. The ongoing literature analyzes natural forking mainly from the macroscopic perspective, which is insufficient to further understand this phenomenon since it roots in the instantaneous difference between block creation and propagation microscopically. Hence, in this article, we fill this gap by leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct the first micro study of natural forking, aiming to reveal its inherent mechanism substantially. Our work is featured by 1) conceptual innovation . We creatively abstract the blockchain overlay network as a “service system”. This allows us to investigate natural forking from the perspective of “supply and demand”. Based on this, we can identify the competitive dynamics of blockchain and construct a queuing model to characterize natural forking; 2) progressiveness . We scrutinize the natural forking probability as well as its decay rate via a three-step scheme from simple to complex, which are the single-source i.i.d. scheme, the single-source non-i.i.d. scheme, and the many-source non-i.i.d. scheme. By doing so, we can answer when and how fast should we take actions and what actions should we take against natural forking. Our valuable findings can not only put forward decisive guidelines theoretically from the top level, but also engineer optimal countermeasures operationally on a practical level to thwart natural forking.}

	abstract = {Building hardware security primitives with on-device memory fingerprints is a compelling proposition given the ubiquity of memory in electronic devices, especially for low-end Internet of Things devices for which cryptographic modules are often unavailable. However, the use of fingerprints in security functions is challenged by the small, but unpredictable variations in fingerprint reproductions from the same device due to measurement noise. Our study formulates a novel and pragmatic approach to achieve highly reliable fingerprints from device memories. We investigate the transformation of raw fingerprints into a noise-tolerant space where the generation of fingerprints is intrinsically highly reliable. We derive formal performance bounds to support practitioners to easily adopt our methods for applications. Subsequently, we demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to investigate the practicability of extracting noise-tolerant fingerprints from commodity devices. Together with extensive simulations, we have employed 119 chips from five different manufacturers for extensive experimental validations. Our results, including an end-to-end implementation demonstration with a low-cost wearable Bluetooth inertial sensor capable of on-demand and runtime key generation, show that key generators with failure rates less than\n10\n−6\ncan be efficiently obtained with noise-tolerant fingerprints with a single fingerprint snapshot to support ease-of-enrollment.}

	abstract = {The workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) is a well-studied problem in access control seeking allocation of authorised users to every step of the workflow, subject to workflow specification constraints. It was noticed that the number\nk\nof steps is typically small compared to the number of users in the real-world instances of WSP; therefore\nk\nis considered as the parameter in WSP parametrised complexity research. While WSP in general was shown to be W[1]-hard, WSP restricted to a special case of user-independent (UI) constraints is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). However, restriction to the UI constraints might be impractical. To efficiently handle non-UI constraints, we introduce the notion of branching factor of a constraint. As long as the branching factors of the constraints are relatively small and the number of non-UI constraints is reasonable, WSP can be solved in FPT time. Extending the results from Karapetyan et al. (2019), we demonstrate that general-purpose solvers are capable of achieving FPT-like performance on WSP with arbitrary constraints when used with appropriate formulations. This enables one to tackle most of practical WSP instances. While important on its own, we hope that this result will also motivate researchers to look for FPT-aware formulations of other FPT problems.}

	abstract = {To bound information leakage in outputs of protocols, it is important to construct secure multiparty computation protocols which output differentially private values perturbed by the addition of noise. However, previous noise generation protocols have round and communication complexity growing with differential privacy budgets, or require parties to locally generate non-uniform noise, which makes it difficult to guarantee differential privacy against active adversaries. We propose three kinds of protocols for generating noise drawn from certain distributions providing differential privacy. The two of them generate noise from finite-range variants of the discrete Laplace distribution. For\n(ϵ,δ)\n-differential privacy, they only need constant numbers of rounds independent of\nϵ,δ\nwhile the previous protocol needs the number of rounds depending on\nδ\n. The two protocols are incomparable as they make a trade-off between round and communication complexity. Our third protocol non-interactively generate shares of noise from the binomial distribution by predistributing keys for a pseudorandom function. It achieves communication complexity independent of\nϵ\nor\nδ\nfor the computational analogue of\n(ϵ,δ)\n-differential privacy while the previous protocols require communication complexity depending on\nϵ\n. We also prove that our protocols can be extended so that they provide differential privacy in the active setting.}

With more ICS components are exposed on the Internet, huge threats are emerging through the exploitation on the inherent defects of ICS protocols. However, the proprietary of ICS protocols makes it extremely hard to build intrusion detection system or perform penetration tests for ICS security reinforcement. In this work, we introduce a symbolic-execution based protocol reverse analysis framework to extract the message format and field type of ICS protocols from real-world PLC firmware. We design new coverage metric and path prioritization strategy to enhance symbolic execution for extensive protocol reverse analysis. Moreover, we propose a field-expression based method on protocol message format inference, along with the analysis on the value ranges of fields which are ignored by previous work. Our evaluation shows that our methods can extract more protocol information during symbolic execution, and achieve high accuracy on protocol reverse analysis compared to Wireshark. Furthermore, we equip the results on private ICS protocols with a black-box fuzzer to test two real-world PLCs. In total, we have found 10 vulnerabilities, including 4 new vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {For vacating-room-after-encryption reversible data hiding in encrypted images (VRAE RDHEI), an essential problem is how to address potential errors in data extraction and image recovery. This problem significantly limits the capacities of the existing VRAE RDHEI methods. To solve the problem while losing as little capacity as possible, in this article, a novel method is proposed that uses the ideas of noisy channel model and channel code. By designing the data hiding mechanism appropriately, the embedding and extraction of data in the proposed method can be equivalent to the input and output of a virtual binary symmetric channel (BSC) model, so that the errors in data extraction are equivalent to the bit transitions in BSC. Based on the virtual BSC model, polar code is used to encode the secret data in the data hider's side. With the help of polar code, the receiver can decode the extracted bits containing errors to obtain correct secret data, then recover the error-free original image based on the corrected secret data. The experimental results proved that, compared with the existing VRAE methods, the proposed method can significantly improve the capacity and the quality of the decrypted images under the premise of complete reversibility.}

	abstract = {The rapid development and wide application of blockchain not only highlight the significance of privacy protection (including anonymity and confidentiality) but also the necessity of auditability. While several ingenious schemes such as MiniLedger and traceable Monero supporting both privacy protection and auditability have been proposed, they either provide incomplete privacy protection (only achieving anonymity within a small set or only providing confidentiality but not anonymity), or involve additional auditing conditions such as reaching threshold transaction volume or requiring permissioned nodes to serve as the manager, or restrict to specific blockchain types such as Monero. To mitigate these issues, this article proposes a generic anonymous, confidential, and auditable transaction system (named ACA), which is compatible with both UTXO-based permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Core technologies of ACA include designed traceable anonymous key generation and publicly verifiable authorization mechanisms from existing cryptographic tools (i.e., public key encryption, partially homomorphic encryption, and accumulator) as well as the meticulous designed signatures of knowledge and smart contract. To demonstrate the entity of our proposal, we first prove its security including authenticity, anonymity, confidentiality and soundness, and then provide an instantiation to evaluate its performance. The final implementation and benchmarks show that our proposal can still gain performance advantage even adding more functionalities.}

	abstract = {Data reconstruction attack has become an emerging privacy threat to Federal Learning (FL), inspiring a rethinking of FL's ability to protect privacy. While existing data reconstruction attacks have shown some effective performance, prior arts rely on different strong assumptions to guide the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Generative Instance Reconstruction Attack (CGIR attack) that drops all these assumptions. Specifically, we propose a batch label inference attack in non-IID FL scenarios, where multiple images can share the same labels. Based on the inferred labels, we conduct a “coarse-to-fine” image reconstruction process that provides a stable and effective data reconstruction. In addition, we equip the generator with a label condition restriction so that the contents and the labels of the reconstructed images are consistent. Our extensive evaluation results on two model architectures and five image datasets show that without the auxiliary assumptions, the CGIR attack outperforms the prior arts, even for complex datasets, deep models, and large batch sizes. Furthermore, we evaluate several existing defense methods. The experimental results suggest that pruning gradients can be used as a strategy to mitigate privacy risks in FL if a model tolerates a slight accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {Fraud detection in telecom network is a crucial problem that threatens users’ privacy and property security. In recent years, fraudsters adopt more advanced camouflage strategies to avoid being detected by traditional algorithms. To deal with these new types of fraud, it is necessary to analyze the integrated spatial-temporal features, which are rarely involved in existing literature. In this article, we propose a novel fraud detection model based on the intertwined spatial-temporal patterns of user behaviors. Specifically, we first introduce the extension of statistical and interactive features to dynamic call patterns, and build a probabilistic model to simulate users’ call behaviors. Then the sequential patterns reflecting users’ own behaviors are obtained by the mixture Hidden Markov Models, and the structural patterns reflecting the collaboration between users in the telecom network are obtained by the attention-based Graph-SAGE model. Finally, our model outputs a fraud score for each user to detect potential fraudsters. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world telecom dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our intertwined spatial-temporal call patterns can effectively represent user behavior and improve the accuracy of fraud detection compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results also validate the efficiency and the interpretability of our model.}

	abstract = {Blockchain, a distributed and shared ledger, provides a credible and transparent solution to increase application auditability by querying the immutable records written in the ledger. Unfortunately, existing query APIs offered by the blockchain are inflexible and unscalable. Some studies propose off-chain solutions to provide more flexible and scalable query services. However, the query service providers (SPs) may deliver fake results without executing the real computation tasks and collude to cheat users. In this article, we propose a novel intelligent blockchain analytics platform termed iQuery , in which we design a game theory based smart contract to ensure the trustworthiness of the query results at a reasonable monetary cost. Furthermore, the contract introduces the second opinion game that employs a randomized SP selection approach coupled with non-ordered asynchronous querying primitive to prevent collusion. We achieve a fixed price equilibrium, destroy the economic foundation of collusion, and can incentivize all rational SPs to act diligently with proper financial rewards. In particular, iQuery can flexibly support semantic and analytical queries for generic consortium or public blockchains, achieving query scalability to massive blockchain data. Extensive experimental evaluations show that iQuery is significantly faster than state-of-the-art systems. Specifically, in terms of the conditional, analytical, and multi-origin query semantics, iQuery is 2 ×, 7 ×, and 1.5 × faster than advanced blockchain and blockchain databases. Meanwhile, to guarantee 100% trustworthiness, only two copies of query results need to be verified in iQuery , while iQuery 's latency is\n2∼134\n× smaller than the state-of-the-art systems.}

Once the user's private key for auditing is exposed, most of the existing data integrity auditing schemes would inevitably become unable to work. To deal with this problem, we construct a novel and efficient identity-based data integrity auditing scheme with key-exposure resilience for cloud storage. This is achieved by designing a novel key update technique, which is fully compatible with BLS signature used in identity-based data integrity auditing. In our design, the Third Party Auditor (TPA) is responsible for generating update information. The user can update his private key based on the private key in one previous time period and the update information from the TPA. Furthermore, the proposed scheme supports real lazy update, which greatly improves the efficiency and the feasibility of key update. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme relies on identity-based cryptography, which makes certificate management easy. The security proof and the performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves desirable security and efficiency.}

	abstract = {As a widely used industrial field bus, the controller area network (CAN) lacks security mechanisms (e.g., encryption and authentication) and is vulnerable to security attacks (e.g., masquerade). A fingerprint-based intrusion detection system (IDS) in CAN networks can detect masquerade attacks by scanning the unique clock signals of CAN devices. However, most state-of-the-art fingerprint-based IDSs commonly use an analog-to-digital converter module with a low frequency of 60 MHz to sample CAN signals, lowering the detection accuracy of fingerprint-based IDSs. In addition, almost all fingerprint-based IDSs are trained offline and then detected online, ignoring that system clock signals of hardware change over time, resulting in degraded detection performance. This paper proposes an online learning-enabled and fingerprint-based IDS (OFIDS) in CAN networks to increase the sampling frequency, shorten the detection response time, and increase the detection accuracy. OFIDS uses a high-speed comparator (i.e., TLV3501) and FPGA (i.e., Xilinx ZYNQ-7010) to sample the CAN_High signal, achieving a low sampling delay time of 4.5 ns and a high sampling frequency of 1 GHz. The self-adaptability of the backpropagation neural network is taken advantage of and used to train the OFIDS model with a detection accuracy of 99.9992%. OFIDS is deployed to a CAN network prototype with five CAN devices (i.e., two Arduino UNO boards and three STM32 microcontrollers) and a real vehicle. Experimental results show that OFIDS can achieve at least 99.99% detection accuracy within 0.18μs in a CAN network prototype and can achieve 98% detection accuracy in a real vehicle.}

	abstract = {Secure cloud search services provide a cost-effective way for resource-constrained clients to search encrypted files in the cloud, where data owners can customize search authorization. Despite providing fine-grained authorization, traditional attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) solutions generally support single keyword search. Towards expressive queries over encrypted data, multi-client searchable symmetric encryption (MC-SSE) was introduced. However, current search authorizations of existing MC-SSEs: (i) cannot support dynamic updating; (ii) are (semi-)black-box implementations of attribute-based encryption; (iii) incur significant cost during system initialization and file encryption. To address these limitations, we present AasBirch, an MC-SSE system with fast fine-grained authorization that supports adaptable authorization switching from one policy to any other one. AasBirch achieves constant-size storage and lightweight time cost for system initialization, file encryption and file searching. We conduct extensive experiments based on Enron dataset in real cloud environment. Compared to state-of-the-art MC-SSE with fine-grained authorization, AasBirch achieves 30\n∼200×\nsmaller public parameter and secret key size, with the assumed least frequent keyword in a query (\ns\n-term) as 21. Moreover, it runs 10\n∼20×\nfaster for file encryption and\n>20×\nfaster for file searching. In addition, AasBirch outperforms 80,000× (resp. 7,850×) faster with\ns\n-term=1 (resp. =21), as compared to classic dynamic ABKS system.}

	abstract = {This paper presents Window Canaries, a novel approach to Stack Canaries for architectures with a register window that protects return addresses and stack pointers without the need of adding additional instruction to each potentially vulnerable function. Instead, placement and check of the canary word is moved to window exception handlers that are responsible to handle register window overflows and underflows. The approach offers low performance overhead while guaranteeing that return addresses are protected by stack buffer overflows without relying on a heuristic that decides which functions to instrument. The contributions of this paper are a complete implementation of the approach for the Xtensa LX architecture with register window option as well as a performance evaluation and discussion of advantages and drawbacks.}

	abstract = {Many blockchain applications require democratic on-chain decision-making. In this work, we propose a community-inclusive decentralised collaborative decision-making system with privacy assurance. Its key component is a two-stage voting scheme inspired by choice architecture. Our decision-making system is compatible with most existing blockchain infrastructures. In addition, it supports liquid democracy/delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Namely, stake holders can either vote directly on proposals or delegate their voting power to experts. When majority of voting committee members are honest, no one can derive voters’ voting preferences or delegations with non-negligible probability. To support concurrent multiple voting events, we design a distributed batch key generation protocol that can generate multiple keys simultaneously by voting committee members with amortised communication cost of\nO(n)\nper key, where\nn\nis the number of participants. Besides, our system supports “evolving committee”, i.e., voting committee members can be changed during the voting period. We implemented a pilot system in Scala, benchmark results indicate that our system can support large number of participants with high efficiency.}

	abstract = {This study explores data-driven detection of firmware/software Trojans in embedded systems without golden models. We consider embedded systems such as single board computers and industrial controllers. While prior literature considers side channel based anomaly detection, this study addresses the following central question: is anomaly detection feasible when using low-fidelity simulated data without using data from a known-good (golden) system? To study this question, we use data from a simulator-based proxy as a stand-in for unavailable golden data from a known-good system. Using data generated from the simulator, one-class classifier machine learning models are applied to detect discrepancies against expected side channel signal patterns and their inter-relationships. Side channels fused for Trojan detection include multi-modal side channel measurement data (such as Hardware Performance Counters, processor load, temperature, and power consumption). Additionally, fuzzing is introduced to increase detectability of Trojans. To experimentally evaluate the approach, we generate low-fidelity data using a simulator implemented with a component-based model and an information bottleneck based on Gaussian stochastic models. We consider example Trojans and show that fuzzing-aided golden-free Trojan detection is feasible using simulated data as a baseline.}

	abstract = {Model extraction attacks (MEAs) allow adversaries to replicate a surrogate model analogous to the target model's decision pattern. While several attacks and defenses have been studied in-depth, the underlying reasons behind our susceptibility to them often remain unclear. Analyzing these implication influence factors helps to promote secure deep learning (DL) systems, it requires studying extraction attacks in various scenarios to determine the success of different attacks and the hallmarks of DLs. However, understanding, implementing, and evaluating even a single attack requires extremely high technical effort, making it impractical to study the vast number of unique extraction attack scenarios. To this end, we present a first-of-its-kind holistic evaluation of implication factors for MEAs which relies on the attack process abstracted from state-of-the-art MEAs. Specifically, we concentrate on four perspectives. we consider the impact of the task accuracy, model architecture, and robustness of the target model on MEAs, as well as the impact of the model architecture of the surrogate model on MEAs. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sixteen model architectures and four image datasets. Surprisingly, our study shows that improving the robustness of the target model via adversarial training is more vulnerable to model extraction attacks.}

	abstract = {In this work, we present OPUPO to protect machine learning classifiers against black-box membership inference attacks by alleviating the prediction difference between training and non-training samples. Specifically, we apply order-preserving and utility-preserving obfuscation to prediction vectors. The order-preserving constraint strictly maintains the order of confidence scores in the prediction vectors, guaranteeing that the model's classification accuracy is not affected. The utility-preserving constraint, on the other hand, enables adaptive distortions to the prediction vectors in order to protect their utility. Moreover, OPUPO is proved to be adversary resistant that even well-informed defense-aware adversaries cannot restore the original prediction vectors to bypass the defense. We evaluate OPUPO on machine learning and deep learning classifiers trained with four popular datasets. Experiments verify that OPUPO can effectively defend against state-of-the-art attack techniques with negligible computation overhead. In specific, the inference accuracy could be reduced from as high as 87.66% to around 50%, i.e., random guess, and the prediction time will increase by only 0.44% on average. The experiments also show that OPUPO could achieve better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.}

	abstract = {In recent years, online video sharing platforms have been widely available on social networks. To protect copyright and track the origins of these shared videos, some video watermarking methods have been proposed. However, their robustness performance is significantly degraded under geometric deformations, which destroy the synchronization between the watermark embedding and extraction. To this end, we propose a novel robust blind video watermarking scheme by embedding the watermark into low-order recursive Zernike moments. To reduce the time complexity, we give an efficient computation method by exploring the characteristics of video and moments. The moment accuracy is greatly improved due to the introduction of a recursive computation method. Furthermore, we design an optimization strategy to enhance visual quality and reduce distortion drift of watermarked videos by analyzing the radial basis function. The robustness of the proposed scheme is verified by different attacks, including geometric deformations, length-width ratio changes, temporal synchronization attacks, and combined attacks. In practical applications, the proposed scheme effectively resists processing from video sharing platforms and screenshots taken with smartphones and PC monitors. The watermark is extracted without the host video. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.}

	abstract = {The limitations of the professional knowledge and cognitive capabilities of both attackers and defenders mean that moving target attack-defense conflicts are not completely rational, which makes it difficult to select optimal moving target defense strategies difficult for use in real-world attack-defense scenarios. Starting from the imperfect rationality of both attack-defense, we construct a Wright-Fisher process-based moving target defense strategy evolution model called WF-MTD. In our method, we introduce rationality parameters to describe the strategy learning capabilities of both the attacker and the defender. By solving for the evolutionarily stable equilibrium, we develop a method for selecting the optimal defense strategy for moving targets and describe the evolution trajectories of the attack-defense strategies. Our experimental results in our example of a typical network information system show that WF-MTD selects appropriate MTD strategies in different states along different attack paths, with good effectiveness and broad applicability. In addition, compared with no hopping strategy, fixed periodic route hopping strategy, and random periodic route hopping strategy, the route hopping strategy based on WF-MTD increase defense payoffs by 58.7%, 27.6%, and 24.6%, respectively.}

	abstract = {A zero-knowledge (ZK) proof guarantees that the result of a computation is correct while keeping part of the computation details private. Some ZK proofs are tiny and can be verified in short time, which makes them one of the most promising technologies for solving two key aspects: the challenge of enabling privacy to public and transparent distributed ledgers and enhancing their scalability limitations. Most practical ZK systems require the computation to be expressed as an arithmetic circuit that is encoded as a set of equations called rank-1 constraint system (R1CS). In this paper, we present Circom , a programming language and a compiler for designing arithmetic circuits that are compiled to R1CS. More precisely, with Circom , programmers can design arithmetic circuits at a constraint level, and the compiler outputs a file with the R1CS description, and WebAssembly and C++ programs to efficiently compute all values of the circuit. We also provide an open-source library called circomlib with multiple circuit templates. Circom can be complemented with snarkjs , a library for generating and validating ZK proofs from R1CS. Altogether, our software tools abstract the complexity of ZK proving mechanisms and provide a unique and friendly interface to model low-level descriptions of arithmetic circuits.}

	abstract = {We propose a stealthy clean-label video backdoor attack against Deep Learning (DL)-based models aiming at detecting a particular class of spoofing attacks, namely video rebroadcast attacks. The injected backdoor does not affect spoofing detection in normal conditions, but induces a misclassification in the presence of a specific triggering signal. The proposed backdoor relies on a temporal trigger altering the average chrominance of the video sequence. The backdoor signal is designed by taking into account the peculiarities of the Human Visual System (HVS) to reduce the visibility of the trigger, thus increasing the stealthiness of the backdoor. To force the network to look at the presence of the trigger in the challenging clean-label scenario, we choose the poisoned samples used for the injection of the backdoor following a so-called Outlier Poisoning Strategy (OPS). According to OPS, the triggering signal is inserted in the training samples that the network finds more difficult to classify. The effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack and its generality are validated experimentally on different datasets and anti-spoofing rebroadcast detection architectures.}

	abstract = {Today many web applications in the cloud (apps) are built based on microservices. However, as the anomaly propagates in a highly dynamic and complex way, troubleshooting them becomes full of challenges. Existing diagnostic methods are mostly designed based on monitoring metrics retrieved from the microservice system kernel. Therefore, application owners and even site reliability engineers (SREs) cannot effectively resort to those methods when the microservice systems lack such a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure. In this article, we develop DyCause, a crowdsourcing solution to the asymmetric diagnostic information problem. Our solution collects the operational status of kernel services collaboratively from the user space and initiates diagnosis on demand. Without the requirement of any architectural or functional infrastructure, it is both fast and lightweight to deploy DyCause in a microservice system. In order to discover the fine-grained dynamic causalities between services during the anomaly, we also design an efficient algorithm based on statistical analysis. Based on this algorithm, we can also analyze the anomaly propagation paths within the microservice system and generate a better interpretable diagnosis. In our evaluation, we test DyCause in a controlled simulation environment and a real-world cloud system. Our results have shown that DyCause has the best accuracy and efficiency among several state-of-the-art methods and is more robust in terms of parameters.}

	abstract = {This article proposes a tag-based approach for physical (PHY)-layer authentication in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system. We first extract the intrinsic PHY-layer features of RIS communication systems in terms of channel gain and background noise, and then apply these PHY-layer features, a random signal as well as the private key of the transmitter to construct a robust cover tag signal against the impersonation attack. We adopt an asymmetric cryptography technique to encrypt tagged signals and to resist against unauthorized detection and tampering attacks during the transmission process. The receiver then applies the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) ratio test to conduct authentication based on the received tag signal, a reference tag signal transmitted in training phase and the knowledge of distributions of the channel gain, background noise and the random signal. We also provide security analysis to demonstrate how the proposed scheme can resist unauthorized detection, tampering attacks, etc. With the help of tools of the MAP ratio test, maximum likelihood estimation, we further analyze the distribution of the test statistics and derive analytical models for the false alarm and detection probabilities. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical results and to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.}

Therefore, cyber security analysts employ threat intelligence, alert correlations, machine learning, and advanced visualizations in order to produce sound attack hypotheses. In this article, we present AttackDB, a multi-level threat knowledge base that combines data from multiple threat intelligence sources to associate high-level ATT&CK techniques with low-level telemetry found in behavioral malware reports. We also present the Attack Hypothesis Generator which relies on knowledge graph traversal algorithms and a variety of link prediction methods to automatically infer ATT&CK techniques from a set of observable artifacts. Results of experiments performed with 53K VirusTotal reports indicate that the proposed algorithms employed by the Attack Hypothesis Generator are able to produce accurate adversarial technique hypotheses with a mean average precision greater than 0.5 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of over 0.8 when it is implemented on the basis of AttackDB. The presented toolkit will help analysts to improve the accuracy of attack hypotheses and to automate the attack hypothesis generation process.}

	abstract = {Recently, model stealing attacks are widely studied but most of them are focused on stealing a single non-discrete model, e.g., neural networks. For ensemble models, these attacks are either non-executable or suffer from intolerant performance degradation due to the complex model structure (multiple sub-models) and the discreteness possessed by the sub-model (e.g., decision trees). To overcome the bottleneck, this paper proposes a divide-and-conquer strategy called DivTheft to formulate the model stealing attack to common ensemble models by combining active learning (AL). Specifically, based on the boosting learning concept, we divide a hard ensemble model stealing task into multiple simpler ones about single sub-model stealing. Then, we adopt AL to conquer the data-free sub-model stealing task. During the process, the current AL algorithm easily causes the stolen model to be biased because of ignoring the past useful memories. Thus, DivTheft involves a newly designed uncertainty sampling scheme to filter reusable samples from the previously used ones. Experiments show that compared with the prior work, DivTheft can save almost 50% queries while ensuring a competitive agreement rate to the victim model.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) empowers distributed clients to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model through exchanging parameter information. Despite the fact that FL can protect clients’ raw data, malicious users can still crack original data with disclosed parameters. To amend this flaw, differential privacy (DP) is incorporated into FL clients to disturb original parameters, which however can significantly impair the accuracy of the trained model. In this work, we study an imperative question which has been vastly overlooked by existing works: what are the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy is maximized. In FL, the parameter server (PS) needs to query participating clients for multiple global iterations to complete training. Each client responds a query from the PS by conducting a local iteration. We consider FL that will uniformly and randomly select participating clients to conduct local iterations with the FedSGD algorithm. Our work investigates how many times the PS should query clients and how many times each client should reply the PS by incorporating two most extensively used DP mechanisms (i.e., the Laplace mechanism and Gaussian mechanisms). Through conducting convergence rate analysis, we can determine the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy can be maximized. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with publicly available datasets: MNIST and FEMNIST, to verify our analysis and the results demonstrate that properly setting the numbers of queries and replies can significantly improve the final model accuracy in FL with DP.}

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attracted increasing attention recently owing to their impressive abilities to generate realistic samples with high privacy protection. Without directly interacting with training examples, the generative model can be used to estimate the underlying distribution of an original dataset while the discriminator can examine model quality of the generated samples by comparing the label values with training examples. In considering privacy issues in GANS, existing works focus on perturbing the parameters and analyzing the corresponding privacy protection capability, and the parameters are not directly exchanged between the generator and discriminator in GANs. Thus, in this work, we propose a Rényi-differentially private-GAN (RDP-GAN), which achieves differential privacy (DP) in a GAN by carefully adding random Gaussian noise to the value of the exchanged loss function during training. Moreover, we derive analytical results characterizing the total privacy loss under the subsampling method and cumulative iterations, which show its effectiveness for the privacy budget allocation. In addition, in order to mitigate the negative impact of injecting noises, we enhance the proposed algorithm by adding an adaptive noise tuning step, which will change the amount of added noise according to the testing accuracy. Through extensive experimental results, we verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better privacy level while producing high-quality samples compared with a benchmark DP-GAN scheme based on noise perturbation on training gradients.}

	abstract = {Moving target defenses (MTDs) are widely used as an active defense strategy for thwarting cyberattacks on cyber-physical systems by increasing diversity of software and network paths. Recently, machine Learning (ML) and deep Learning (DL) models have been demonstrated to defeat some of the cyber defenses by learning attack detection patterns and defense strategies. It raises concerns about the susceptibility of MTD to ML and DL methods. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of ML and DL models when it comes to deciphering MTD methods and ultimately evade MTD-based protections in real-time systems. Specifically, we consider a MTD algorithm that periodically randomizes address assignments within the MIL-STD-1553 protocol—a military standard serial data bus. Two ML and DL-based tasks are performed on MIL-STD-1553 protocol to measure the effectiveness of the learning models in deciphering the MTD algorithm: 1) determining whether there is an address assignments change i.e., whether the given system employs a MTD protocol and if it does 2) predicting the future address assignments. The supervised learning models (random forest and k-nearest neighbors) effectively detected the address assignment changes and classified whether the given system is equipped with a specified MTD protocol. On the other hand, the unsupervised learning model (K-means) was significantly less effective. The DL model (long short-term memory) was able to predict the future addresses with varied effectiveness based on MTD algorithm's settings.}

	abstract = {Recently, a number of attacks have been demonstrated (like key reinstallation attack, called KRACK) on WPA2 protocol suite in Wi-Fi WLAN, for which a patching is often challenging. In this article, we design and implement a system, called CheckShake, to passively detect anomalies in the handshake of Wi-Fi security protocols, in particular WPA2, between a client and an AP using COTS radios. Our proposed system works without decrypting any traffic and sniffing on multiple channels in parallel. It uses a state machine model for grouping Wi-Fi handshake packets and then perform deep packet inspection to identify the symptoms of the anomaly in specific stages of a handshake session. Our implementation of CheckShake does not require any modification to the firmware of the client or the AP or the COTS devices, it only requires to be physically placed within the range of the AP and its clients. We use both the publicly available dataset and our own data set for performance analysis of CheckShake. Using gradient boosting-based supervised machine learning (ML) models, we show that an accuracy around 98.50% with no false positive can be achieved using CheckShake in open sourced data that has non-zero probability of missing packets per group of packets.}

	abstract = {Decentralized Identity (DID) is emerging as a new digital identity management scheme that promises users complete control of their personal data and identification without central authority involvement. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has drafted the DID standard and provided reference implementations. We conduct a security analysis of the W3C DID standard and the reference universal resolver implementation, focusing on user privacy in the DID resolving process. The universal resolver is the key component in the architecture that processes DID requests and DID document retrievals. Our analysis demonstrates that privacy issues can arise due to the imprudent design of the universal resolver. Furthermore, we found that side-channels in the DID document caching schemes of real-world DID services can entail privacy concerns. Motivated by our security analysis, we present a novel DID resolving design, called Oblivira, to enable obliviously DID resolving. Oblivira is a secure resolving agent with a small footprint that enforces the universal resolver to resolve requests without knowing their content. We also propose a privacy-preserving DID document caching scheme that eliminates side-channels. Our evaluation results show that Oblivira only incurs approximately 2.6% of overhead on average with different resolver settings (3, 6, and 12 threads).}

	abstract = {The rising of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and the Industry 4.0 paradigms demands the design and implementation of Digital Twin Frameworks (DTFs) that may support the quick build of reliable Digital Twins (DTs) for experimental and testing purposes. Most of the current DTF proposals allow the generation of DTs at a good pace but affect generality, scalability, portability, and completeness. As a consequence, current DTF are mostly domain-specific and hardly span several application domains (e.g., from simple IoT deployments to the modeling of complex critical infrastructures). Furthermore, the generated DTs often requires a high amount of computational resource to run. In this paper, we present LiDiTE, a solution based on a novel reference model for general-purpose DTFs. LiDiTE overcomes the limitations of state-of-the-art tools by supporting the fine-grained development of real-world complexity scenarios. To achieve that, LiDiTE builds on technologies that favor scalability, reuse, and extensibility of scenarios. We show such features by building the DT of real critical infrastructure and evaluating the performance of our DT against those of the real system. Further contributions of this paper include open access to the source code of LiDiTE and the experimental dataset.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) supports the rapid development of service function chain (SFC), which efficiently connects a sequence of network virtual function instances (VNFIs) placed into physical infrastructures. Current SFC migration mechanisms usually keep static SFC deployment after finishing certain objectives, and deployment methods mostly provide static resource allocation for VNFIs. Therefore, the adversary has enough time to plan for devastating attacks for in-service SFCs. Fortunately, moving target defense (MTD) was proposed as a game-changing solution to dynamically adjust network configurations. However, existing MTD methods mostly depend on attack-defense models, and lack adaptive mutation period. In this article, we propose an Intelligence-Driven Service Function Chain Migration (ID-SFCM) scheme. First, we model a Markov decision process (MDP) to formulate the dynamic arrival or departure of SFCs. To remove infeasible actions from the action space of MDP, we formalize the SFC deployment as a constrained satisfaction problem. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named model-based adaptive proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) to enable attack-resistant migration decisions and adaptive migration period. Finally, we evaluate the defense performance by multiple attack strategies and two realistic datasets called CICIDS-2017 and LYCOS-IDS2017 respectively. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of ID-SFCM compared with representative solutions.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing promises great advantages in handling the exponential data growth. Secure deduplication can greatly improve cloud storage efficiency while protecting data confidentiality. In the meantime, when data are outsourced to the remote cloud, there is an imperative need to audit the integrity. Most existing works only consider the support for either secure deduplication or integrity auditing. Recently, there have been some research efforts aiming to integrate secure deduplication with integrity auditing. However, prior works are unsatisfactory in that they suffer from the leakage of ownership privacy and forgeability of auditing results for low-entropy data. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that delicately bridges secure deduplication and integrity auditing in encrypted cloud storage. In contrast with prior works, our scheme protects the ownership privacy and prevents the cloud service provider from forging the auditing results for low-entropy data. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain-based mechanism that helps to ensure key recoverability and reduce local storage cost of keys. Formal analysis is provided to justify the security guarantees. Experiment results demonstrate the modest performance overhead of our scheme.}

One has to zoom in to the affected code regions and look for local anomalies distinguishable from the benign workload to detect such attacks. We propose pervasive micro information flow tracking ( PerMIT ) that realizes variable-level online dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) as a means to detect the attacks. The system uses hardware virtualization extension to monitor access to taint source variables and performs asynchronous code emulation to infer the local information flow. We demonstrate that the pervasive micro information flow can sufficiently capture the attacks and incurs only a small overhead. Given the program source code, the system can further enrich the semantics of micro information flow by embedding the variable names. We have integrated the system with machine learning algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection for zero-day attacks with pervasive micro information flow.}

	abstract = {CAPTCHA is an effective mechanism for protecting computers from malicious bots. With the development of deep learning techniques, current mainstream text-based and traditional image-based CAPTCHAs have been proven to be insecure. Therefore, a major effort has been directed toward developing new CAPTCHAs by utilizing some other hard Artificial Intelligence (AI) problems. Recently, some commercial companies (Tencent, NetEase, Geetest, etc.) have begun deploying a new type of CAPTCHA based on visual reasoning to defend against bots. As a newly proposed CAPTCHA, it is therefore natural to ask a fundamental question: are visual reasoning CAPTCHAs as secure as their designers expect? This paper explores the security of visual reasoning CAPTCHAs. We proposed a modular attack and evaluated it on six different real-world visual reasoning CAPTCHAs, which achieved overall success rates ranging from 79.2% to 98.6%. The results show that visual reasoning CAPTCHAs are not as secure as anticipated; this latest effort to use novel, hard AI problems for CAPTCHAs has not yet succeeded. Then, we summarize some guidelines for designing better visual-based CAPTCHAs, and based on the lessons we learned from our attacks, we propose a new CAPTCHA based on commonsense knowledge (CsCAPTCHA) and show its security and usability experimentally.}

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A carefully-designed backdoor trigger will mislead the victim model to misclassify any sample with the trigger to the target label. Nevertheless, existing works usually utilize visible triggers, such as a white square at the corner of the image, which are easily detected by human inspections. Current efforts on developing invisible triggers yield low attack success in the physical domain. In this paper, we propose Kaleidoscope, an RGB (red, green, and blue) filter-based backdoor attack method, which utilizes RGB filter operations as the backdoor trigger. To enhance the attack success rate, we design a novel model-dependent filter trigger generation algorithm. We also introduce two constraints in the loss function to make the backdoored samples more natural and less distorted. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNette, and VGG-Flower have demonstrated that RGB filter-processed samples not only achieve high attack success rate but also are unnoticeable to humans. It is shown that Kaleidoscope can reach an attack success rate of more than 84% in the physical world under different lighting intensities and shooting angles. Kaleidoscope is also shown to be robust to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, such as spectral signature, STRIP, and MNTD.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) protects training data in clients by collaboratively training local machine learning models of clients for a global model, instead of directly feeding the training data to the server. However, existing studies show that FL is vulnerable to various attacks, resulting in training data leakage or interfering with the model training. Specifically, an adversary can analyze local gradients and the global model to infer clients’ data, and poison local gradients to generate an inaccurate global model. It is extremely challenging to guarantee strong privacy protection of training data while ensuring the robustness of model training. None of the existing studies can achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose a robust privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PILE), which protects the privacy of local gradients and global models, while ensuring their correctness by gradient verification where the server verifies the computation process of local gradients. In PILE, we develop a verifiable perturbation scheme that makes confidential local gradients verifiable for gradient verification. In particular, we build two building blocks of zero-knowledge proofs for the gradient verification without revealing both local gradients and global models. We perform rigorous theoretical analysis that proves the security of PILE and evaluate PILE on both passive and active membership inference attacks. The experiment results show that the attack accuracy under PILE is between\n[50.3%,50.9%]\n, which is close to the random guesses. Particularly, compared to prior defenses that incur the accuracy losses ranging from 2% to 13%, the accuracy loss of PILE is negligible, i.e., only\n±0.3%\naccuracy loss.}

	abstract = {The lack of scalability is a leading issue of blockchain. By transferring transactions to off-chain, 2-party payment channels achieve instant transaction confirmation between channel users and enhance the blockchain throughput, thereby becoming a promising solution. By extending the channel from 2-party to multi-party, richer application scenarios could be supported. Meanwhile, new and exclusive requirements emerge in the multi-party off-chain payments, including robustness and flexibility. The robustness requires that the channel operation would not be impeded by any uncooperative channel member, and the flexibility guarantees that parties could join or exit the channel dynamically. However, all the current attempts either fail to achieve the new emerging properties or sacrifice some merits of 2-party channels. In this paper, we propose a new multi-party channel construction, Magma, which has good scalability. Magma outperforms the previous solutions to the multi-party payment channel for the following reasons. By canceling the heavy reliance on the cooperation of all channel members when implementing the channel operation, Magma achieves robustness. Magma also allows parties to join or exit one channel flexibly, without violating the balance security. Meanwhile, Magma's whole transaction process is performed off-chain, thereby inheriting the instant confirmation and low-cost features of 2-party channels. To guarantee the security of Magma, we formalize the multi-party channel's functionality and prove that Magma is secure in the UC framework. Moreover, our implementation and comparison show that Magma is practical and performs better than existing solutions in providing off-chain payment services.}

	abstract = {Data is becoming the world's most valuable asset and the ultimate renewable resource. This phenomenon has led to online personal data markets where data owners and collectors engage in the data sale and purchase. From the collector's standpoint, a key question is how to set a proper pricing rule that brings profitable tradings. One feasible solution is to set the price slightly above the owner's data cost. Nonetheless, data cost is generally unknown by the collector as being the owner's private information. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning algorithm, modified stochastic gradient descent (MSGD) that infers the owner's cost model from her interactions with the collector. To protect owners’ data privacy during trading, we employ the framework of local differential privacy (LDP) that allows owners to perturb their genuine data and trading behaviors. The vital challenge is how the collector can derive the accurate cost model from noisy knowledge gathered from owners. For this, MSGD relies on auxiliary parameters to correct biased gradients caused by noise. We formally prove that the proposed MSGD algorithm produces a sublinear regret of\nO(\nT\n5\n6\nlog(\nT\n1\n3\n)\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n√\n)\n. The effectiveness of our design is further validated via a series of in-person experiments that involve 30 volunteers.}

	abstract = {In this article, we cryptanalyzed a Verifiable Threshold Predicate Encryption (VTPE) enabled Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication (PPBA) protocol reported in IEEE-TDSC and revealed discrepancies between its security claims and our security analysis. To be precise, the underlying authentication and key agreement scheme which is based on a challenge-response mechanism and watermark signal unsatisfactorily meets the following security scenario: (a) resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks, (b) biometric template protection, and (c) user anonymity and untraceability. To address these issues, we utilize Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) to design a PUF driven Verifiable Threshold Predicate Encryption (PUF-VTPE) scheme and a secure PPBA protocol. The PUF-VTPE-based PPBA protocol equips with dual authentication using biometric and mobile device, which offers strong authenticity before establishing the session key. Simultaneously, the non-invertible property of PUF protects the biometric templates in the physical layer. The proposed storage-free mechanism that hides the challenge of device PUF in biometric template alleviates data leakage caused by storage challenges in PUF-based authentication protocols. Moreover, the experimental analysis suggests that the proposed PPBA protocol possesses ISO/IEC 24745 criteria of non-invertibility, unlinkability, and revocability. Additionally, the proposed PPBA protocol reduces the computational cost by about 50% compared to that of the cryptanalyzed scheme.}

	abstract = {The increase in scale of cyber networks and the rise in sophistication of cyber-attacks have introduced several challenges in intrusion detection. The primary challenge is the requirement to detect complex multi-stage attacks in realtime by processing the immense amount of traffic produced by present-day networks. In this paper we present PRISM, a hierarchical intrusion detection architecture that uses a novel attacker behavior model-based sampling technique to minimize the realtime traffic processing overhead. PRISM has a unique multi-layered architecture that monitors network traffic distributedly to provide efficiency in processing and modularity in design. PRISM employs a Hidden Markov Model-based prediction mechanism to identify multi-stage attacks and ascertain the attack progression for a proactive response. Furthermore, PRISM introduces a stream management procedure that rectifies the issue of alert reordering when collected from distributed alert reporting systems. To evaluate the performance of PRISM, multiple metrics have been proposed, and various experiments have been conducted on multi-stage attack datasets. The results exhibit up to 7.5x improvement in processing overhead as compared to a standard centralized IDS without the loss of prediction accuracy while demonstrating the ability to predict different attack stages promptly.}

	abstract = {Getting access to labeled datasets in certain sensitive application domains can be challenging. Hence, one may resort to transfer learning to transfer knowledge learned from a source domain with sufficient labeled data to a target domain with limited labeled data. However, most existing transfer learning techniques only focus on one-way transfer which may not benefit the source domain. In addition, there is the risk of a malicious adversary corrupting a number of domains, which can consequently result in inaccurate prediction or privacy leakage. In this paper, we construct a secure and Verif iable collaborative T ransfer L earning scheme, VerifyTL, to support two-way transfer learning over potentially untrusted datasets by improving knowledge transfer from a target domain to a source domain. Furthermore, we equip VerifyTL with a secure and verifiable transfer unit employing SPDZ computation to provide privacy guarantee and verification in the multi-domain setting. Thus, VerifyTL is secure against malicious adversary that can compromise up to\nn−1\nout of\nn\ndata domains. We analyze the security of VerifyTL and evaluate its performance over four real-world datasets. Experimental results show that VerifyTL achieves significant performance gains over existing secure learning schemes.}

	abstract = {Differential-private federated learning (DP-FL) has emerged to prevent privacy leakage when disclosing encoded sensitive information in model parameters. However, the existing DP-FL frameworks usually preserve privacy homogeneously across clients, while ignoring the different privacy attitudes and expectations. Meanwhile, DP-FL is hard to guarantee that uncontrollable clients (i.e., stragglers) have truthfully added the expected DP noise. To tackle these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous differential-private federated learning framework, named HDP-FL, which captures the variation of privacy attitudes with truthful incentives. First, we investigate the impact of the HDP noise on the theoretical convergence of FL, showing a tradeoff between privacy loss and learning performance. Then, based on the privacy-utility tradeoff, we design a contract-based incentive mechanism, which encourages clients to truthfully reveal private attitudes and contribute to learning as desired. In particular, clients are classified into different privacy preference types and the optimal privacy-price contracts in the discrete-privacy-type model and continuous-privacy-type model are derived. Our extensive experiments with real datasets demonstrate that HDP-FL can maintain satisfactory learning performance while considering different privacy attitudes, which also validate the truthfulness, individual rationality, and effectiveness of our incentives.}

As the first scheme to achieve the feature mentioned above, FABRIC not only enjoys constant computation overhead in the encryption, decryption, and re-encryption phases when the quantity of attributes increases, but is also unbounded such that the new attributes or roles could be adopted into the system anytime. Furthermore, FABRIC achieves adaptive security under the decisional linear assumption (DLIN). Eventually, detailed theoretical and experimental analysis proved that FABRIC enjoys excellent performance in efficiency and practicality in the cloud computing scenario.}

In recent decades, some major detection methods for network covert channels have been developed. In this article, we investigate two highly cited detection methods for covert timing channels, namely\nϵ\n-similarity and compressibility score from Cabuk et al. (jointly cited by 949 articles and applied by several researchers). We additionally analyze two recent ML-based detection methods: GAS (2022) and SnapCatch (2021). While all these detection methods must be considered valuable for the analysis of typical covert timing channels, we show that these methods are not reliable when a covert channel's behavior is slightly modified. In particular, we demonstrate that when confronted with a simple covert channel that we call\nϵ\n-\nκ\nlibur, all detection methods can be circumvented or their performance can be significantly reduced although the covert channel still provides a high bitrate. In comparison to existing timing channels that circumvent these methods,\nϵ\n-\nκ\nlibur is much simpler and eliminates the need of altering previously recorded traffic. Moreover, we propose an enhanced\nϵ\n-similarity that can detect the classical covert timing channel as well as\nϵ\n-\nκ\nlibur.}

	abstract = {Despite achieving exceptional performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from the harassment caused by adversarial examples, which are produced by corrupting clean examples with tiny perturbations. Many powerful defense methods have been presented such as training data augmentation and input reconstruction which, however, usually rely on the prior knowledge of the targeted models or attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting adversarial images, which can protect any pre-trained DNN classifiers and resist an endless stream of new attacks. Specifically, we first adopt a dual autoencoder to project images to a latent space. The dual autoencoder uses the self-supervised learning to ensure that small modifications to samples do not significantly alter their latent representations. Next, the mutual information neural estimation is utilized to enhance the discrimination of the latent representations. We then leverage the prior distribution matching to regularize the latent representations. To easily compare the representations of examples in the two spaces, and not rely on the prior knowledge of the targeted model, a simple fully connected neural network is used to embed the learned representations into an eigenspace, which is consistent with the output eigenspace of the targeted model. Through the distribution similarity of an input example in the two eigenspaces, we can judge whether the input example is adversarial or not. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet show that the proposed method has superior defense performance and transferability than state-of-the-arts.}

Moreover, they only consider simplified security scenarios; but less is known about the attacking performance in complex scenarios where the capability of detectors or attackers varies. To fill the gap, we propose a novel, detector-agnostic trace removal attack. The attack removes all possible counterfeiting traces arising from the original DeepFake manufacture procedure to make DeepFakes essentially more "realistic" and thus able to defeat arbitrary or unknown detectors. Concretely, we first perform an in-depth DeepFake trace discovery, identifying three intrinsic traces: spatial anomalies, spectral disparities, and noise fingerprints. Then an adversarial learning-based trace removal network (TR-Net) involving one generator and multiple discriminators is proposed. Each discriminator is responsible for one individual trace representation to avoid inner-trace interference. All discriminators are optimized in parallel to enforce the generator to remove various traces simultaneously. We additionally craft heterogeneous security scenarios where the detectors are embedded with different levels of defense and the attackers own varying background data knowledge. The experimental results show that the proposed trace removal attack can significantly compromise the detection accuracy of six state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors while causing only a negligible degradation in visual quality.}

	abstract = {Anchor link prediction exacerbates the risk of privacy leakage via the de-anonymization of social network data. Embedding-based methods for anchor link prediction are limited by the excessive similarity of the associated nodes in a latent feature space and the variation between latent feature spaces caused by the semantics of different networks. In this article, we propose a novel method which reduces the impact of semantic discrepancies between different networks in the latent feature space. The proposed method consists of two phases. First, graph embedding focuses on the network structural roles of nodes and increases the distinction between the associated nodes in the embedding space. Second, a federated adversarial learning framework which performs graph embedding on each social network and an adversarial learning model on the server according to the observable anchor links is used to associate independent graph embedding approaches on different social networks. The combination of distinction enhancement and the association of graph embedding approaches alleviates variance between the latent feature spaces caused by the semantics of different social networks. Extensive experiments on real social networks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and robustness.}

	abstract = {Recently, stealing highly-valuable and large-scale deep neural network (DNN) models becomes pervasive. The stolen models may be re-commercialized, e.g., deployed in embedded devices, released in model markets, utilized in competitions, etc, which infringes the Intellectual Property (IP) of the original owner. Detecting IP infringement of the stolen models is quite challenging, even with the white-box access to them in the above scenarios, since they may have experienced fine-tuning, pruning, functionality-equivalent adjustment to destruct any embedded watermark. Furthermore, the adversaries may also attempt to extract the embedded watermark or forge a similar watermark to falsely claim ownership. In this article, we propose a novel DNN watermarking solution, named\nHufuNet\n, to detect IP infringement of DNN models against the above mentioned attacks. Furthermore, HufuNet is the first one theoretically proved to guarantee robustness against fine-tuning attacks. We evaluate HufuNet rigorously on four benchmark datasets with five popular DNN models, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The experiments and analysis demonstrate that HufuNet is highly robust against model fine-tuning/pruning, transfer learning, kernels cutoff/supplement, functionality-equivalent attacks and fraudulent ownership claims, thus highly promising to protect large-scale DNN models in the real world.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems facilitate personalized service provision through the statistical analysis and model training of user historical data (e.g., browsing behavior, travel history, etc). To address the underpinning privacy implications associated with such systems, a number of privacy-preserving recommendation approaches have been presented. There are, however, limitations in many of these approaches. For example, approaches that apply public key (fully) homomorphic encryption (FHE) on different users. historical ratings under a unique public key of a target recommendation user incur significant computational overheads on resource-constrained local users and may not be scalable. On the other hand, approaches without utilizing public key FHE can neither resist chosen ciphertext attack (CCA), nor be straightforwardly applied to the setting of distributed servers. In this paper, a lightweight privacy-preserving distributed recommender system is proposed. Specifically, we present a new cryptographic primitive (i.e., tag-based multikey fully homomorphic data encapsulation mechanism; TMFH-DEM) designed to achieve CCA security for both input privacy and result privacy. TMFH-DEM enables a set of distributed servers to collaboratively execute efficient privacy-preserving outsourced computation on multiple inputs encrypted under different secret keys from different data owners, without using public key FHE. Building on TMFH-DEM, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving distributed recommender system, which flexibly returns all the recommended items with certain predicted ratings for all target users. Formal security proof shows that our proposal achieves both user historical rating data privacy and recommendation result privacy. Findings from our evaluations demonstrate its practicability in terms of scalability, recommendation accuracy, computational and communication efficiency.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused massive financial loss worldwide. Researchers thereby have proposed a series of solutions to detect APT attacks, such as dynamic/static code analysis, traffic detection, sandbox technology, endpoint detection and response (EDR), etc. However, existing defenses are failed to accurately and effectively defend against the current APT attacks that exhibit strong persistent, stealthy, diverse and dynamic characteristics due to the weak data source integrity, large data processing overhead and poor real-time performance in the process of real-world scenarios. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose APTSHIELD, a stable, efficient and real-time APT detection system for Linux hosts. In the aspect of data collection, audit is selected to stably collect kernel data of the operating system so as to carry out a complete portrait of the attack based on comprehensive analysis and comparison of existing logging tools; In the aspect of data processing, redundant semantics skipping and non-viable node pruning are adopted to reduce the amount of data, so as to reduce the overhead of the detection system; In the aspect of attack detection, an APT attack detection framework based on ATT&CK model is designed to carry out real-time attack response and alarm through the transfer and aggregation of labels. Experimental results on both laboratory and Darpa Engagement show that our system can effectively detect web vulnerability attacks, file-less attacks and remote access trojan attacks, and has a low false positive rate, which adds far more value than the existing frontier work.}

	abstract = {As the ultimate goal of steganalysis, secret message extraction plays a decisive role in obtaining secret communication evidence and cracking down on criminal activities. For STC (Syndrome-Trellis Codes)-based adaptive steganography, existing pioneering work on secret message extraction: the method based on run test under plaintext embedding may misjudge incorrect stego key as correct stego key, resulting in the failure of extraction. To avoid such a situation, this manuscript proposed a secret message extraction method based on optimal hypothesis test with 100% accuracy under plaintext embedding. First, it is proved that there is a probability distribution difference between the sub-sequence extracted by correct and incorrect stego key. Then, based on the difference, an optimal hypothesis test model is designed to recover the correct stego key. Finally, given the probability of type I and II errors, the sample size and threshold in the hypothesis test are derived. Classic adaptive steganography such as HUGO (Highly Undetectable Steganography) and J-UNIWARD (JPEG Universal Wavelet Relative Distortion) have been conducted experiment, showing that the proposed method can extract message with 100% accuracy and 44 bits sample size, which verifies the correctness of the theorem and the effectiveness of the method.}

	abstract = {Acquiring and analyzing exploits, which take advantage of vulnerabilities to conduct malicious actions, are crucial for victims (and defenders) when responding to system compromising incidents. However, exploits are sensitive and valuable assets that are not available to victims. The most common resource available for victims to investigate is network traffic, which covers the exploitation period. Thus reconstructing exploits from network traffic is demanded. In practice, the reconstruction process is performed manually, thus inefficient and non-scalable. In this article, we present an automated solution TAICHI to reconstruct exploits from network traffic, able to generate replica exploits and facilitate timely incident analysis. By nature, a working exploit has to satisfy (1) path constraints which ensure the program path same as the original exploit's is explored and the same vulnerability is triggered, and (2) exploit constraints which ensure the same exploitation strategy is applied, e.g., to bypass deployed defenses or to stitch multiple gadgets together. We propose a hybrid solution to this problem by integrating techniques including multi-version execution (MVE), dynamic taint analysis (DTA), and concolic execution. We have implemented a prototype of TAICHI on x86 and x86-64 Linux and tested it on the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) dataset, several Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, and Metasploit exploit modules targeting real world applications. The evaluation results showed that TAICHI could reconstruct exploits efficiently with a high success rate. Moreover, it could be applied to production environments without disrupting running services, and could reconstruct exploits even if only one round of exploitation traffic is available.}

	abstract = {In mobile crowdsensing (MCS), truth discovery (TD) plays an important role in sensing task completion. Most of the existing studies focus on the privacy preservation of mobile users, and the reliability of mobile users is evaluated by their weights which are calculated based on the submitted sensing data. However, if mobile users are unreliable, the submitted sensing data and their weights are also unreliable, which may influence the accuracy of the ground truths of sensing tasks. Therefore, this article proposes a privacy-preserving and reputation-based truth discovery framework named PRTD which can generate the ground truths of sensing tasks with high accuracy while preserving privacy. Specifically, we first preserve sensing data privacy, weight privacy, and reputation value privacy by utilizing the Paillier algorithm and Pedersen commitment. Then, to verify whether the reputation values of mobile users are tampered with and select mobile users that satisfy the corresponding reputation requirements, we design a privacy-preserving reputation verification algorithm based on reputation commitment and zero-knowledge proof and propose a concept of reliability level to select mobile users. Finally, a general TD algorithm with reliability level is presented to improve the accuracy of the ground truths of sensing tasks. Moreover, theoretical analysis and performance evaluation are conducted, and the evaluation results demonstrate that the PRTD framework outperforms the existing TD frameworks in several evaluation metrics in the synthetic dataset and real-world dataset.}

	abstract = {The potential of Bitcoin for money laundering and terrorist financing represents a significant challenge in law enforcement. In recent years, the use of privacy-improving CoinJoin transactions has grown significantly and helped criminal actors obfuscate Bitcoin money flows. In this study, we use unsupervised machine learning to analyze the complete Bitcoin user graph in order to identify suspicious actors potentially involved in illegal activities. In contrast to the existing studies, we introduce a novel set of features that we use to identify potential criminal activity more accurately. Furthermore, we apply our clustering algorithm to a CoinJoin-adjusted variant of the Bitcoin user graph, which enables us to analyze the network at a more detailed, user-centric level while still offering opportunities to address advanced privacy-enhancing techniques at a later stage. By comparing the results with our ground truth data set, we find that our improved clustering method is able to capture significantly more illicit activity within the most suspicious clusters. Finally, we find that users associated with illegal activities commonly have significant short paths to CoinJoin wallets and show tendencies toward outlier behavior. Our results have potential contributions to anti-money laundering efforts and combating the financing of terrorism and other illegal activities.}
