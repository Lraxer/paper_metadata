	abstract = {Numerical vector aggregation plays a crucial role in privacy-sensitive applications, such as distributed gradient estimation in federated learning and statistical analysis of key-value data. In the context of local differential privacy, this study provides a tight minimax error bound of  O ( d s n ϵ 2 ) O(\\frac{ds}{n\\epsilon ^{2}}) , where  d d  represents the dimension of the numerical vector and  s s  denotes the number of non-zero entries. By converting the conditional/unconditional numerical mean estimation problem into a frequency estimation problem, we develop an optimal and efficient mechanism called Collision. In contrast, existing methods exhibit sub-optimal error rates of  O ( d 2 n ϵ 2 ) O(\\frac{d^{2}}{n\\epsilon ^{2}})  or  O ( d s 2 n ϵ 2 ) O(\\frac{ds^{2}}{n\\epsilon ^{2}}) . Specifically, for unconditional mean estimation, we leverage the negative correlation between two frequencies in each dimension and propose the CoCo mechanism, which further reduces estimation errors for mean values compared to Collision. Moreover, to surpass the error barrier in local privacy, we examine privacy amplification in the shuffle model for the proposed mechanisms and derive precisely tight amplification bounds. Our experiments validate and compare our mechanisms with existing approaches, demonstrating significant error reductions for frequency estimation and mean estimation on numerical vectors.}

	abstract = {Stealthy attacks manipulate the operation of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) without being undetected, allowing persistent manipulation of system operation and thus the potential to cause destructive damage. This article introduces a new vulnerability of ICS that can be exploited to mount stealthy attacks without requiring any domain knowledge. This vulnerability is caused by a common practice in system monitoring, i.e., the SCADA monitors ICS operation at a much lower frequency than system execution, causing a loss of precision when the SCADA tries to cross-validate the issued control commands using the collected sensory data. Exploiting this vulnerability, an attack called PLC-SAGE is designed to stealthily manipulate the system operation by identifying and injecting malicious control commands that will not be concluded as abnormal by the SCADA. This article further discusses a preferred ICS engineering practice and an attestation strategy to mitigate the above vulnerability and protect ICS from PLC-SAGE. Both PLC-SAGE and the proposed mitigations have been experimentally validated on two ICS platforms.}

	abstract = {Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) allow users to access the internet using domain names in their native languages. This technology provides significant convenience for non-English speaking users. However, despite the widespread acceptance and use of IDNs, the risks associated with using IDNs remain unclear in practice, such as the IDN homograph problem. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic analysis of the IDN homograph problem and explore the adoption characteristics of IDNs in practice. Specifically, we design and implement an effective IDN analysis framework, named as IDNMon. We perform a large-scale measurement study covering 863 top-level domain zone files and historical top lists based on IDNMon. Our findings indicate that the IDN registration and usage in Europe exceeds that in East Asia. Our results confirm that the IDN homograph problem is universal (12.32% of 2,623,161 IDNs face this problem), which raises serious challenges when designing protection strategies for browsers. Our work provides new insights into the adoption of IDNs in practice, contributes to a better understanding, and promotes the development of IDNs.}

	abstract = {The plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their diversified requirements have opted to design security mechanisms that cover all major security requirements. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) is the most common network domains where IoT devices are launched, particularly because of its easy availability. Security, in other words authentication however, remains to be a major constriction for IoT-WLAN deployments. Though there are IoT based authentication protocols prevailing, such protocols are either prone to threats such as perfect forward secrecy violations, insider with database access attack, traceability attack, stolen device attack, ephemeral secret leakage, or they consume excessive computational and communication resources that result in an unprecedented burden for the IoT system. This article presents an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) based mechanism for IoT devices deployed in a WLAN that addresses the above security issues and achieves cost-effectiveness. Validation follows an informal and formal approaches (using GNY and BAN logic, and Scyther verification tool) for the proposed protocol, demonstrating its robustness. Our performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is lightweight and more secure in contrast to the state-of-the-art solutions. In addition, performance of the proposed protocol subjected to unknown attacks is investigated, which deduces that the proposed protocol has less overhead under unknown attacks than its competitors. A prototype of the protocol has been developed to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy.}

	abstract = {Smart tags are compact electronic devices affixed to or embedded into objects to facilitate identification, monitoring, and data exchange. Consequently, secure authentication of these tags is a crucial issue, as objects must reliably verify their identity before sharing sensitive information with other entities. The application of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) as a device's “digital fingerprint” has attracted significant attention, yet existing PUF-based authentication methods exhibit security vulnerabilities, either due to the authentication protocol itself or the limited reliability of the PUF technology used. Moreover, there has been a considerable focus on the software aspect, often overlooking the critical role of hardware design, which can become a target for attacks aimed at compromising the device's identity or act as a hindrance in the manufacturing process. In light of these points, this paper introduces an identification tag architecture that leverages PUF technology, focusing on authentication. This architecture features a straightforward but efficient authentication protocol, underpinned by a new and highly stable PUF model. The overall architecture encompasses particular hardware implementation aspects that significantly simplify the tag's enrollment phase and minimize vulnerabilities to attacks. The paper also describes a prototype of this identification tag and provide detailed insights into its application.}

	abstract = {Split learning (SL) aims to protect a client's data by splitting up a neural network among the client and the server. Previous efforts have shown that a semi-honest server can conduct a model inversion attack. However, those attacks require the knowledge of the client network structure, and the performance deteriorates dramatically as the client network gets deeper ( \\geq 2 ≥ 2 \\geq 2  layers). In this work, we explore the attack in a more general and challenging situation where the client model is unknown and more complex. We unveil the inherent privacy leakage through a series of intermediate server models during SL, and propose a new attack on SL: Pseudo-Client ATtack (PCAT). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attack for a semi-honest server to steal clients’ functionality, reconstruct private inputs and labels without any knowledge about the clients’ network structure. Moreover, the attack is transparent to clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack outperforms previous works in scenarios involving more complex models and learning tasks, even in non-i.i.d. settings and confronted with conventional defensive measures. We further explore novel defense mechanisms to mitigate PCAT and improve our attack to counteract the potential defenses.}

	abstract = {The security of GPUs has recently gained significant attention. To support secure memory for GPUs, the critical performance bottleneck is the memory bandwidth contention between the regular data and the security metadata (Yuan et al. 2021). With counter-mode encryption, the security meta includes counters, the Bonsai Merkle Tree (BMT), and message authentication codes (MACs). In this work, we focus on encryption counters given their impact on the counter and BMT traffic while leveraging prior schemes (Saileshwar et al. 2018), (Taassori et al. 2018) to address the MAC traffic. We first analyze the characteristics of the encryption counters from a wide range of GPGPU benchmarks and make two key observations. (1) With the split counter scheme, the cache blocks in a large portion of the memory space, sometimes the entire GPU memory space, share the same major counter value. (2) The difference among minor counters is limited. We then propose a novel scheme to reduce the encryption counter traffic. Our design includes (a) a highly compact way of counter representation and (b) a verification scheme to determine the correct minor counter values. Compared to prior works on reducing counter traffic (Na et al. 2021), our scheme handles more counter value patterns (as we don't restrict the counters to be the same in a memory chunk) and is more effective in reducing counter traffic.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. However, FL entails exposing the model to various participants. This poses a risk of unauthorized model distribution or resale by the malicious client, compromising the intellectual property rights of the FL group. To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this article, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embed the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints. Experimental results show FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, and maintains good fidelity and robustness against various watermark removal attacks.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that guarantees the privacy of user data. However, FL has been shown to be vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks (GLA), which have the ability to reconstruct private training data from public gradients with high probability. These attacks are either analytic-based, requiring modification of the FL model, or optimization-based, requiring long convergence times and failing to effectively address the challenge of dealing with highly compressed gradients in practical FL systems. This paper presents a pioneering generation-based GLA method called FGLA that can reconstruct batches of user data without the need for the optimization process. We specifically design a feature separation technique that first extracts the features of each sample in a batch and then directly generates the user data. Our extensive experiments on multiple image datasets show that FGLA can reconstruct user images in seconds with a batch size of 256 from highly compressed gradients (0.8% compression ratio or higher), thereby significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Link-flood attacks (LFAs) overwhelm bandwidth on links in a network using traffic from many sources, which is indistinguishable from benign traffic. Unfortunately, traditional DDoS defenses are incapable of stopping such attacks and recently proposed software-defined solutions are ineffective. In this work, we observe a new opportunity for mitigating LFAs using optical networking advances. In essence, we envision new capabilities for topology programming, to scale capacity on-demand to avoid congestion and add new links to the network to create new paths for traffic during LFA incidents. Realizing these benefits of optical topology programming raises unique challenges; the search space for candidate topology configurations is very large and joint optimization of topology and routing is NP-hard. We present ONSET—a framework that tackles these challenges to lay a practical foundation for topology programming-based defenses against LFAs. We show that ONSET complements existing programmable network defenses and amplifies their benefits. We perform a what-if style analysis of ONSET by simulating a wide-ranging set of attacks, including terabit-scale attacks against every single link, on five networks with two different routing capabilities and observe that ONSET provides the means to mitigate congestion loss in more than 90% of the hundreds of diverse attack scenarios considered.}

Current incentive schemes designed for Tor generally rely on centralized roles, thus presenting a risk of destroying Tor’s anonymity. This paper proposes R2E, a decentralized scheme that treats Tor relay services as cryptocurrency mining and rewards the relays with generated tokens while addressing the challenge of how to design decentralized protocols that quantify workload while ensuring fairness and anonymity. We construct the Proof-of-Relay protocol in R2E that enforces random circuit selection, limits the number of nonce attempts, and exploits one-time keys and zero-knowledge proofs to protect participants’ identities. We implemented a prototype of R2E based on Ethereum and conducted the trial operation and several confirmation experiments involving  2^{20} 2^{20}  clients,  2^{10} 2^{10}  to  2^{16} 2^{16}  nodes, and 256 circuits for each client to demonstrate its applicability. Analysis and experimental results show that R2E can effectively ensure the anonymity of participants’ identities and fairness of incentive allocation while showing good performance in overhead and scalability, making it easy to be quickly applied in practical deployments.}

	abstract = {As one of the most successful techniques in hunting software bugs, Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzing (CGF) intends to move fuzzing campaigns towards executions that can trigger bugs. This process can be divided into two steps, including reaching suspicious code regions and exploring their execution states. Many CGFs propose approaches to efficiently reach suspicious code regions and individual execution states, but fail to explore complex execution states. The challenge is how to explore execution states so that fuzzing can detect multiple types of bugs, while maintaining the code coverage. To address this challenge, we propose BazzAFL to investigate code coverage and multiple types of bugs. The crux of BazzAFL is to maintain a bunch of seed groups, where each seed saves the best performance on one objective. With the seed group, BazzAFL prioritizes code regions that most likely contain bugs based on multi-objective optimization and adaptively divides energy among the seeds in a group based on Shannon's entropy. Meanwhile, during mutation, BazzAFL tends to mutating the bytes that can change the execution states. With these solutions, BazzAFL gradually moves fuzzing campaigns towards locations and execution states of bugs. Experimental results show that BazzAFL identifies at least 62 more bugs on 24 programs compared with other fuzzers.}

	abstract = {Network path validation aims to give more control over the forwarding path of data packets in a path-aware network, which shields the network from security threats and allows end hosts to receive better services. Therefore, network path validation becomes a vital primitive for secure and reliable Internet services in the next generation networks. The path validation enables end hosts and intermediate router nodes to check whether a packet has followed the intended path. However, the existing solutions fail to protect path privacy and incur significant bandwidth and computation overhead on packet transferring, which degrades packet delivery performance. In this paper, we propose the StealthPath to protect path privacy and improve delivery efficiency. First, StealthPath uses lightweight cryptographic primitives to generate nested proofs and ensures all nodes on the path to check the compliance of the forwarding path efficiently. Second, StealthPath hides the forwarding path in the proofs and reduces the proof size from linear to constant, which protects the path information and path length, and decreases the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, StealthPath allows on-path nodes to extract their proofs and the next hop address from proof without leaking on-path node index. Finally, StealthPath is proved to resist various attacks and preserves the path privacy. The experiments show that StealthPath saves nearly 60% header size and bandwidth, and is more efficient than state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Secure data forwarding is critical for users to meet their requirements. In this paper, we propose D3 (Demon Detector in Data Plane), a source-driven, secure fault localization mechanism, which empowers the source to localize faulty link in Path Aware Networking, thus circumventing faulty link to guarantee secure data forwarding. D3 utilizes the source to instruct the on-path routers, thus empowering it to detect whether the on-path routers forward the packet as expected. Compared with existing schemes that are difficult to be deployed in practice due to the heavy storage, computation, and communication overhead, D3 offloads most of the on-path router's storage and computation overhead, thus dramatically improving the deployment efficiency. Particularly, the length of the additional packet header in D3 is 2-5 times less than the state-of-the-art mechanisms, thus having a low communication overhead. Besides that, the destination in D3 could keep stateless processing, thus having backward compatibility and eliminating the opportunity for DoS attacks toward a stateful destination. The BMv2 and Barefoot Tofino hardware evaluations show that D3 could achieve high fault localization accuracy and process the packet at line rate.}

	abstract = {The federated learning paradigm protects private data from explicit leakage, yet exposing the model weights still raises serious privacy concerns with well-known attacks, such as membership inference attacks. It has been acknowledged that mechanisms such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy can be adopted to provide a higher level of protection. However, these mechanisms may incur a formidable amount of overhead and reductions in training performance, which make them unlikely to be employed in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose MaskCrypt, a new mechanism designed to balance the trade-off between security and practicality when homomorphic encryption is used. Rather than encrypting model updates in their entirety, MaskCrypt applies an encryption mask to sift out a small portion of the updates for encryption. Specifically, each MaskCrypt client adopts a gradient-guided mechanism to select the encryption mask, which aims to obfuscate the training trace by maximizing the local loss value of exposed model weights, and then sending the individual mask to a special Mask Consensus mechanism to obtain a final mask for all clients. Our experimental results have shown convincing evidence that with a small encrypt ratio, MaskCrypt reduced the communication overhead by up to 4.15× compared with encrypting entire model updates, yet still effectively protected the client's private data against inversion attacks, and reduced the accuracy of membership inference attacks to 49.2 % \\% .}

To address these challenges, we have developed a highly efficient and scalable access control mechanism that enables automatic and fine-grained access control management while incurring low overhead in large-scale settings. Our mechanism includes a dual-hierarchy access control structure and associated information retrieval algorithms, which we have used to develop a large-scale IoT device access control system called FACT+.

Additionally, our system offers a pay-and-consume scheme and plug-and-play device management for convenient adoption by service providers. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency of our access control mechanism.}

	abstract = {Recently, differential-neural cryptanalysis, which combines deep learning with differential cryptanalysis, has gained attention as a powerful and practical cryptanalysis method. This approach offers the advantage of enabling deep learning to analyze cryptographic properties, traditionally demanding substantial time and expertise. Nevertheless, the black-box nature of deep learning models poses challenges for cryptanalysts in comprehending the construction of the differential dataset. In particular, since the differential dataset serves as the foundation for generating the neural distinguisher, there is a pressing need for an effective methodology to construct a high-quality differential dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct a good differential dataset for differential-neural cryptanalysis. First, we conducted an analysis to find the difference between well-trainable differential datasets and other differential datasets using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. Building upon our analysis results, we proposed the exploring algorithm for the generation of well-trainable differential dataset. This proposed algorithm assesses the input differences within the differential dataset by identifying significant principal components. If such components are found, a cluster evaluation is performed on the differential dataset. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm successfully identified favorable input differences, leading to improved accuracy in neural distinguisher training for SPECK and SIMON. Compared to the performance of the existing Gohr's neural input difference algorithm, our proposed algorithm was more effective in finding good input differences with higher accuracy. From the perspective of execution time, it showed an improvement of approximately 30%.}

	abstract = {Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a standard for implementing dynamic attribute-based access control. It allows access events to trigger programmed administrative obligations and change access privileges during policy execution. However, complex obligations in an NGAC application have the potential of “grave harm to the authorization state through error or intent.” The existing work on NGAC policy testing and verification has limited effectiveness in detecting obligation errors. To address this limitation, we present a novel fault-based testing approach to determining the presence or absence of errors in NGAC policies. It hypothesizes potential errors (faults) in the given policy according to a comprehensive fault model, represents the corrected versions by policy mutants, and validates the hypotheses by generating and executing distinguishing tests. The distinguishing test of a mutant ensures that the mutant and the policy yield distinct execution results – the hypothetical error is present in the policy if the policy's execution result is wrong. We have implemented the approach based on the NGAC reference implementation and applied it to two case studies, including the first fully-fledged NGAC application with sophisticated obligations. The experiment results demonstrate that (a) the subject policies are absent from all hypothetical faults, and (b) all faulty policies represented by the mutants are revealed by fault-based tests. The results also show that the obligation tests targeting individual faults have effectively revealed multi-fault errors. Thus, the proposed approach can help detect potential errors in the development process of NGAC applications.}

	abstract = {As the scale of high-performance computing systems (HPC) continues to expand, the frequency of failures within the system also increases. The follow-up steps in the event of a failure are necessary because efficient prevention measures are absent. These actions, however, result in decreased operating efficiency as the system normalizes. To solve this problem, recent research has utilized deep learning to predict failures in advance by examining log messages. One common method uses log ID extracted from log messages as input data. However, these methods could lead to information loss in log messages and may not accurately capture log message properties. In this study, we propose the prior failure detection in large-scale systems using language models (FALL) that reflects the properties of log messages. The FALL uses log messages as text data and only uses normal data for training. The FALL makes use of sharpening, which concentrates on the minimal lexical change between normal and abnormal log messages. In addition, by leveraging the characteristics of log messages with limited vocabularies, the FALL utilizes only some tokens for anomaly detection. The experiments’ results from log data from real industry-based HPC systems show that the FALL achieves superior performance in early failure detection.}

	abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are essential technologies to ensure safe road traffic management and enhance driving convenience. Nowadays, diversified authentication schemes have been developed in VANETs for the purpose of safer communication between nodes. For instance, biometric technology which employs biometric information as users’ authentic identity is widely adopted in message authentication due to its visible benefits. Nonetheless, there is a significant problem in current biometric identity-based authentication schemes that noise is inevitable in each collection of biometric information, making these schemes lack critical error tolerance. Additionally, anonymous biometric identity is difficult to be realized, which fails to meet the basic standard of VANETs. For solving the above key issues, we propose the first efficient fuzzy certificateless signature-based (FCLS) authentication scheme using anonymous biometric identities for VANETs. In virtue of its superior error tolerance, it enables authentication between two identities represented by two attribute sets within a certain Hamming distance. Besides, the newly developed authentication scheme realizes effective conditional privacy so that drivers’ real biometric identities can be ensured. Through the formal security proof, this FCLS scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attack (EU-CMA) in the random oracle model (ROM), which reaches the higher security. Compared with current advanced schemes, the new authentication scheme is more efficient in computation and communication according to performance analysis.}

An instruction embedding model is a neural network that transforms assembly instructions into embedding vectors. If the embedding network is able to processes sequences of assembly instructions transforming them into a sequence of embedding vectors, then the network effectively represents an assembly code model. In this paper we present BinBert, a novel assembly code model. BinBert is built on a transformer pre-trained on a huge dataset of both assembly instruction sequences and symbolic execution information. BinBert can be applied to assembly instructions sequences and it is fine-tunable, i.e. it can be re-trained as part of a neural architecture on task-specific data. Through fine-tuning, BinBert learns how to apply the general knowledge acquired with pre-training to the specific task. We evaluated BinBert on a multi-task benchmark that we specifically designed to test the understanding of assembly code. The benchmark is composed of several tasks, some taken from the literature, and a few novel tasks that we designed, with a mix of intrinsic and downstream tasks. Our results show that BinBert outperforms state-of-the-art models for binary instruction embedding, raising the bar for binary code understanding.}

	abstract = {Application programs are a possible source of attacks to databases. SQL injection is a well-known attack that exploits the lack of user input sanitization by applications. Following secure code practices to avoid vulnerabilities is the best way to prevent attacks. However, developers usually make mistakes either due to a lack of knowledge (i.e., a beginner developer) or due to bad code practices like copy-paste, which duplicates bugs and vulnerabilities in the code. Detecting such vulnerabilities manually is expensive and time-consuming, especially for very large code bases. Fixing vulnerabilities is also expensive as it requires manual interventions. It is thus clear that in order to systematically find and fix vulnerabilities we need automatic tools. In this article, we address such a need. We propose the Database Client Applications Fixer (DCAFixer) tool, which automatically detects and repairs three types of common vulnerabilities in SQL application programs, namely unsanitized user inputs, insecure credentials handling, and unencrypted connections. DCAFixer operates in three phases: fault localization, patch generation and selection, and patch validation.}

	abstract = {Deeply embedded devices powered by microcontrollers are widely deployed. To protect them from exploitation, many lightweight defense mechanisms, such as control flow integrity, have been proposed. However, these defenses cannot provide data integrity—a security property of particular interest in mission-critical tasks. Conversely, existing defenses that provide data integrity are too expensive to deploy in the resource-constrained context of deeply embedded devices. In this article, we propose InvisiGuard, a hardware-assisted, low overhead approach for data integrity. InvisiGuard leverages data watchpoints—a commonly available debug feature on microcontrollers—to automatically intercept write operations to critical variables. InvisiGuard then checks the legitimacy of the write instruction against an allowlist stored in a trusted execution environment (e.g., ARM TrustZone-M). By relying on the hardware to automatically intercept potentially dangerous instructions, InvisiGuard avoids heavy code instrumentation, as required by traditional solutions, making it suitable for resource-constrained microcontroller devices. We have implemented InvisiGuard on an ARM Cortex-M based development board and evaluated it with seven real-world firmware samples. Our experiments show that InvisiGuard reduces the runtime overhead by 56.99% and memory overhead by 77.37% compared with state of the art.}

	abstract = {Given their usefulness for evading traceability in networks, it is not surprising that steganographic techniques continue in the modern era and have been looked at through the lens of modern threats and technologies. Among such threats include the linkage of contextual information (associated data) to de-anonymize traffic. Such detection would be fatal to steganographic goals. Cryptographic analyses have expanded to include associated data when analyzing confidentiality and authenticity in channel security; in this work we take a similar approach and extrapolate the security model for steganographic analysis to also account for contextual information. We introduce the security definition of Authenticated Stegotext with Associated Data (ASAD), which captures steganographic properties even when there is contextual information sent alongside the hidden data, and provide a concrete stego-embedding scheme, Authenticated SteGotex with Associated tRansaction Data (ASGARD). Our scheme leverages a blockchain-based channel medium for the transmission of hidden data, namely the Ethereum blockchain. We analyze ASGARD in the ASAD framework and present details on implementation and real-world security considerations.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for multi-party collaborative data analysis problems, where analysis accuracy and divergence are required, as well as both privacy of shared data and explainability of results. The proposed approach aims at trading-off data privacy, decision explainability, and data utility by analytically relating these three measures, evaluating how they impact each other, and proposing a methodology to find the best possible trade-off among them. In particular, given a set of requirements from the participants for a collaborative analysis problem, we propose a method to properly tune the parameters of privacy-preserving mechanisms and explainability techniques to be adopted by all participants, obtaining the best trade-off. The paper is focused on deep learning-based image data analysis problems, though the approach can be generalized to other data types. The  ( ϵ , δ ) (\\epsilon, \\delta ) -Differential Privacy and the Autoencoders privacy-preserving techniques have been adopted to preserve data privacy, while the SmoothGrad mechanism has been used to provide decision explainability. The proposed methodology has been validated with a set of experiments on three multi-class deep learning classifiers and three well-known image datasets, MNIST, FER, and CIFAR-10.}

Anonymity with unlinkability is an enhanced version of anonymity because it makes it impossible to “link” workers across the tasks they participate in. Another core feature of crowdsourcing systems is worker quality which expresses a worker's trustworthiness and quantifies their historical performance. In this work, we present  \\mathsf {AVeCQ} \\mathsf {AVeCQ} , the first crowdsourcing system that reconciles these properties, achieving enhanced anonymity and verifiable worker quality updates.  \\mathsf {AVeCQ} \\mathsf {AVeCQ}  relies on a suite of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to (i) guarantee workers’ privacy, (ii) prove the correctness of worker quality scores and task answers, and (iii) commensurate payments.  \\mathsf {AVeCQ} \\mathsf {AVeCQ}  is developed modularly, where requesters and workers communicate over a platform that supports pseudonymity, information logging, and payments. To compare  \\mathsf {AVeCQ} \\mathsf {AVeCQ}  with the state-of-the-art, we prototype it over Ethereum.  \\mathsf {AVeCQ} \\mathsf {AVeCQ}  outperforms the state-of-the-art in three popular crowdsourcing tasks (image annotation, average review, and Gallup polls).

	abstract = {As a fundamental tool for sequential decision-making, the Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits model (CMAB) has been extensively analyzed and applied in various online applications. However, the privacy concerns in budgeted CMAB are rarely investigated thus far. Few bandit algorithms have adequately addressed the privacy-preserving budgeted CMAB setting. Motivated by this, we study this setting using differential privacy as the formal measure of privacy. In this setting, playing an arm yields both a random reward and a random cost, and these values are kept private. In addition, multiple arms can be played in each round. The objective of the decision-maker is to minimize regret while subject to a budget constraint on the cumulative cost of all played arms. We demonstrate an exploration-exploitation-balanced bandit policy, which preserves the privacy of both rewards and costs under budgeted CMAB settings. This policy is proven differentially private and achieves an upper bound on regret. Furthermore, to provide incentives for the differentially private bandit policy so as to ensure that the reported costs are truthful, we introduce the concept of truthfulness and incorporate a payment mechanism that has been proven to be  \\sigma \\sigma -truthful. Numerical simulations based on multiple real-world datasets validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy compared to state-of-the-art policies.}

	abstract = {To improve the accuracy of network attack detection, recent work has proposed deep learning (DL) based detectors. Nonetheless, conventional DL-based solutions are computation-intensive and have to be deployed on high-performance x86 servers, which is inefficient for large-scale networks. Unlike x86 servers, current programmable switches (P4 switches) support a throughput of Tbps and enable programmable logic in networks, indicating a promising alternative. Therefore, we present Soterv2, an intelligent in-network solution deployed on programmable switches. Soterv2 utilizes a two-phase detection manner. In the first phase, we build a P4 program running on the switch's Tofino ASIC to filter malicious packets from the massive traffic. Then, a DL-based inspection is conducted on the switch's CPU, thoroughly detecting the filtered packets. To improve the filtering performance, we propose to embed the rule-based machine learning model, decision tree, in a single match-action table in the P4 program. We also design a lightweight DL model, Branch Convolution Net, running on a multi-core fashion to speed up the thorough detection. Besides, Soterv2 enables the coordination of distributed switches, covering the detection in a large-scale network. Experiments demonstrate that Soterv2 behaves stably in eight network scenarios of different traffic rates (40/100 Gbps) and fulfills per-flow detection in 0.03 s.}

	abstract = {Static information flow analysis has been studied for a long time. It is usually considered more precise than dynamic taint analysis and more flexible and indispensable when running individual modules or the entire program is difficult. The state-of-the-art static information flow analyses are scalable on analyzing Java programs or mobile apps, and several type systems have enforced information flow security on different languages. However, static information-flow analyses have rarely scaled up to real-world C programs. This work presents Sliver, a slicing-based approach to verify information flow security on real-world C programs. The principle of Sliver is to convert the information-flow-involved parts of the original program into behavior-equivalent slices and use bounded model checking to enforce the end-to-end noninterference property or detect security violations on the slices after self-composition. We develop automated path-signature-guided slicing and adaptive self-composition approaches to ensure Sliver's efficacy and scalability. We also develop a consistency testing technique and metrics to estimate the correctness of slices generated by Sliver. The evaluations demonstrate Sliver's effectiveness, scalability, and the correctness of the generated slices.}

	abstract = {OS-level virtualization (a.k.a. container) has become a fundamental technology in cloud computing due to the efficiency provided by the shared-kernel design. However, this design results in containers sharing thousands of kernel variables and data structures (termed abstract resources), which are prevalent but under-protected. Without exploiting other kernel vulnerabilities, a non-privileged container can easily exhaust abstract resources to cause DoS attacks against other containers. Even worse, our experiments demonstrate that abstract resource attacks are a broad class of attacks that affect Linux, FreeBSD, Fuchsia, and all shared-kernel container environments on the top four cloud vendors. To defend against the abstract resource attack, we automatically analyze vulnerable abstract resources in the Linux kernel and detect 501 container-exhaustible resources. To confine these abstract resources dynamically, we propose two new techniques: the flexible in-kernel attachment for flexible resource consumption attachment and the tree-based resource accounting for efficient usage retrieval. Based on these two techniques, we design and implement a flexible abstract resource confinement framework, named Flask, to achieve flexible and efficient abstract resource confinement. Our evaluation shows Flask can efficiently limit abstract resource usage with less than 0.6% performance overhead.}

	abstract = {In networks, clients access various servers. Servers need to authenticate clients’ identities and provide services to clients who pass the authentication. Password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication (PbT-SSO) delegates multiple identity servers to authenticate a client with the client's password, and issue a token for subsequent access. However, existing PbT-SSO schemes are based on conventional hardness problems, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum computers in the near future. Once quantum computers are accessible, adversaries can retrieve passwords by off-line dictionary guessing attacks (DGA) from the credentials of clients’ passwords. Moreover, quantum adversaries can derive identity servers’ secret from public information and further forge tokens with the secret. Motivated by these issues, we propose a password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication from learning with errors problem (LWE), dubbed LPbT-SSO, which is resistant to quantum attacks. LPbT-SSO evaluates a one-way function of passwords, and takes the function outputs as credentials. Since the function is grounded on LWE problem intractable for quantum computation, quantum adversaries cannot recover passwords by off-line DGA. Additionally, LPbT-SSO leverages a lattice-based threshold signature scheme to issue tokens, and guarantees that no adversary can forge a valid token. The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that LPbT-SSO is efficient in terms of computation, storage, and communication costs.}

	abstract = {With the growing need for a robust network backbone to ensure uninterrupted connectivity in the face of large-scale natural disasters, we introduce the Risk Zone-Diversified Network Design (RZDD) problem. This problem requires diverse paths between source-destination pairs to be risk zone-disjoint, preventing any single disaster from disrupting overall network connectivity. Unlike previous research, we propose an innovative cost framework that considers geographically overlapping links and long-term maintenance costs, providing a comprehensive approach to cost analysis. We prove the intractability of the RZDD problem and present the Risk Zone-Diversified Network Design Algorithm (RZDD-Algorithm). In small-scale networks with a single source-destination pair, our algorithm achieves optimal outcomes. Comparative analysis shows that our method reduces costs by an average of 24% compared to an SRLG algorithm that does not consider the preference of geographically overlapping links. For multiple pairs, our approach maintains a gap ratio within 4% and 7% of optimal solutions. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on large networks demonstrate reductions of 26% and 31% compared to the SRLG baseline for single pairs. We also showcase the efficiency of our method in designing large-scale networks with multiple pairs.}

	abstract = {Malware programs are diverse, with varying objectives, functionalities, and threat levels ranging from mere pop-ups to significant financial losses. Consequently, their run-time footprints across the system differ, impacting the optimal data source (Network, Operating system (OS), Hardware) and features that are instrumental to malware detection. Further, the variations in threat levels of malware classes affect the user policies for detection. Thus, the optimal tuple of  \\langle \\tt data \\langle \\tt data - \\tt source \\tt source ,  \\tt features \\tt features ,  \\tt user \\tt user - \\tt policies \\rangle \\tt policies \\rangle , determined experimentally, is different for each malware class, impacting the state-of-the-art detection solutions that are agnostic to these subtle differences. This paper presents  {\\sf SUNDEW} {\\sf SUNDEW} , a framework to detect malware classes using the corresponding optimal tuple of  \\langle \\tt data \\langle \\tt data - \\tt source \\tt source ,  \\tt features \\tt features ,  \\tt user \\tt user - \\tt policies \\rangle \\tt policies \\rangle .  {\\sf SUNDEW} {\\sf SUNDEW}  uses an ensemble of specialized predictors, each trained with a particular data source (network, OS, and hardware) and tuned for features and policies of a specific class.

	abstract = {Weighted set sampling has been proven essential for generating discrete numbers based on their weights and found broad applications in recommendation systems. The extension of this method, known as weighted range set sampling (WRSS), specifies a query range and applies weighted set sampling to the data within that range. With the proliferation of cloud computing, outsourcing encrypted data and data processing tasks to cloud servers has become a common practice to overcome data storage and processing challenges while protecting data privacy. Existing studies have proposed many privacy-preserving solutions for various customized query and data processing tasks, none have specifically addressed privacy-preserving WRSS. In response to this gap, our paper introduces an efficient and privacy-preserving WRSS scheme. We begin by leveraging the three-party secret sharing (TPSS) scheme as a foundation to design an enhanced three-party secret sharing (eTPSS) scheme with superior storage and computational efficiency. Building upon the eTPSS scheme, we introduce a series of private algorithms to safeguard WRSS privacy. Our scheme integrates the use of a binary search tree and the alias method for WRSS, ensuring privacy through eTPSS-based private algorithms. A thorough security analysis under the simulation-based real/ideal worlds model showcases the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The proposed scheme's efficiency has been substantiated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that our scheme marks a significant advancement in addressing the challenges posed by privacy-preserving WRSS.}

GNN classifiers that use Attributed Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs) have demonstrated favorable results in classifying software binaries as malicious or benign. In this work, we show that such classifiers are vulnerable to Adversarial Examples (AEs) by proposing several grey-box adversarial attacks that perform node injection and preserve the semantics of a program. We demonstrate that adversaries can take advantage of the aggregation properties of GNNs to apply effective perturbation outside of the original ACFG nodes of a software binary through node injection. We conducted experiments on our methods and compared them against two similar semantics-preserving adversarial attacks. Our results have shown that our methods of applying perturbation through node injection can result in higher evasion rates while decreasing the amount of perturbation needed to fool detectors. Namely, we deliver an evasion rate of up to 94.83% with only 2.49% of total perturbation, in comparison with a maximum evasion of 79.50% at 2.78% perturbation by a state-of-the-art approach and only 27.44% at 2.95% perturbation by the baseline attack. Our results highlight the need for creating more robust GNN malware detectors.}

Moreover, even when a solution is computed correctly, sub-optimizations that may afflict the performance of the configured VPNs may be introduced. Unfortunately, the possible solution that consists in automating the definition of VPN configurations has been scarcely studied in literature so far. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic approach to compute the configuration of VPN systems. Both the allocation scheme of VPN systems in the network and their protection rules are computed automatically. This result is achieved through the formulation of a Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem, which provides both formal correctness-by-construction and optimization of the result. A framework implementing this approach has been developed, and its experimental validation showed that it is a valid alternative for replacing time-consuming and error-prone human operations for significant problem sizes.}

	abstract = {Multi-signature is a protocol where a set of signatures jointly sign a message so that the final signature is significantly shorter than concatenating individual signatures together. Recently, it finds applications in blockchain, where several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a multi-signature. However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority and it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his own public keys. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is desired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as short as possible. In this article, we find a compiler that converts a kind of identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so that both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The advantage of our result is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly secure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes. The first is Schnorr ID. The second is a new lattice-based ID scheme, which via our compiler gives the first regular lattice-based multi-signature scheme with a key-and-signature size independent of the number of signers without a restart during the signing process.}

	abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is a growing center of cyber attacks, including both volumetric and non-volumetric attacks. Programmable switches provide a new opportunity for more efficient defense against DNS attacks since they can offer better cost, performance, and flexibility trade-offs compared to traditional defense systems. However, programmable switches have strict limitations on the operations and storage space supported to ensure line-speed packet processing. In this paper, we propose DNSGuard, an intelligent in-network defense framework that can handle volumetric and non-volumetric DNS attacks on programmable switches. We propose a recursive incremental parsing algorithm that can effectively extract variable-length domain names. To achieve real-time and accurate detection against two types of DNS attacks, we design a switch-optimized and resource-efficient algorithm to extract both independent features of each packet and domain-based cumulative features. Then, we propose a multi-phase hybrid model architecture to perform dynamic packet analysis at different time phases of a domain. Further, we design efficient model representation mechanisms to deploy tree-based ensemble models in the data plane. Experimental results show that DNSGuard can defend against diverse DNS attacks at the line rate. In addition, DNSGuard introduces a minimal nanosecond latency to normal traffic in heavily loaded networks.}

We present DYST, which represents a new class of covert channels we call history covert channels jointly with the new paradigm of covert channel amplification. All covert channels described until now need to craft seemingly legitimate flows or need to modify third-party flows, mimicking unsuspicious behavior. In contrast, history covert channels can communicate by pointing to unaltered legitimate traffic created by regular network nodes. Only a negligible fraction of the covert communication process requires the transfer of actual covert channel information by the covert channel's sender. This information can be sent through different protocols/channels. Our methodology allows an amplification of the covert channel's message size, i.e., minimizing the fraction of actually transferred secret data by a covert channel's sender in relation to the overall secret data being exchanged. Further, we extend the current taxonomy for covert channels to show how history channels can be categorized. We describe multiple scenarios in which history covert channels can be realized, analyze the characteristics of these channels, and show how their configuration can be optimized.}

	abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WF) aims to identify users’ visited websites from encrypted traffic traces, disabling the anonymity of encrypted communication like the Tor network. It is practical to use historically labeled (source) data, e.g., public datasets, to pre-train a WF model, and then collect few incoming (target) data to re-train this model within a low cost. Unfortunately, there is always a considerable difference of latent feature distributions between the source and target data (i.e., the cross-domain problem) and an inevitable bias of feature distribution caused by a limited volume of target data (i.e., the biased distribution problem). Although current Few-Shot Learning-based WF (FSWF) methods achieve satisfactory performance on the efficient establishment, they lack cross-domain transferability, and meanwhile, are unable to alleviate the distribution bias. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the cross-domain problem among different domains of traffics, revealing the ubiquity and dominant factors of it. To mitigate the cross-domain and biased distribution problems, we propose a Distribution Calibrated Website Fingerprinting (DCWF) method that incorporates a two-stage distribution calibration process and a tailored circle network. In the two-stage calibration process, we first devise a re-modeling mechanism capturing the information distribution of the target domain to extract representative features, and then design a calibration process to adjust the biased distribution of the target domain. Subsequently, a tailored circle network is proposed to reduce the noise caused by the calibration process. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the superiority of our DCWF over comparisons under both close-world and open-world settings.}

	abstract = {The surge in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has created a pressing need for Cross-Chain Transaction (CCTx) solutions. Existing solutions either lack sufficient security, like centralized exchanges, or suffer from poor efficiency and scalability, such as atomic swaps. Inspired by the success of the Lightning Network in accelerating Bitcoin transactions, we propose CrossChannel that establishes cross-and-off-chain micropayment channels to achieve efficient and scalable CCTx. Specifically, we analyze the challenges of extending one-chain channels to cross-chain scenarios caused by the separation of blockchains. To overcome these challenges, we employ the chain relay mechanism to synchronize channel-related information across blockchains and construct the channel management protocol on this basis, ensuring the same security level as one-chain channels in cross-chain settings. We prototype CrossChannel between two Ethereum testnets, comparing its transaction efficiency and costs with a typical HTLC-swap scheme. Results demonstrate the significant advancements in efficiency and scalability offered by CrossChannel. Even with channels closing after just 20 transactions, CrossChannel exhibits a fivefold capacity increase for handling CCTxs compared to HTLC swaps.}

	abstract = {Adversarial training has been widely explored for mitigating attacks against deep models. However, a critical limitation of existing works is that robustness enhancement is at the cost of noticeable accuracy degradation. To achieve a better trade-off between robustness and accuracy, we propose the Vanilla Feature Distillation Adversarial Training (VFDAT), which conducts knowledge distillation from a pre-trained model (optimized towards high accuracy) to guide adversarial training model towards generating high-quality and well-separable features by constraining the obtained features of natural and adversarial examples. More specifically, both adversarial examples and their natural counterparts are forced to be aligned in feature space by distilling predictive representations from a pre-trained natural model. In this way, the adversarial training model can be updated towards maximally preserving the accuracy as gaining robustness. A key advantage of our method is that it can be universally adapted to and boost existing works. Exhaustive experiments on various datasets, classification models, and adversarial training algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

	abstract = {Micro-segmentation (MSG), a pillar of Zero-Trust, provides fine-grained access control for east-west traffic between cloud endpoints (VMs/containers). Admins formulate strict whitelisting MSG policies that allow necessary traffic. However, current MSG systems lack the computability foundation to resolve policy inconsistencies, where policy overlap can cause conflicts that violate the security requirements, and to verify policy reachability to avoid erroneously blocking necessary traffic. Meanwhile, current MSG systems lack comprehensive dynamicity processing, including maintaining invariants when updating MSG policies and promptly adjusting policy enforcement for endpoint status changes. We propose IMS, the first intent-driven MSG system towards computability and dynamicity. IMS innovatively defines the endpoint group space and algebra, providing the computability foundation for formally and automatically verifying and processing MSG policies. Based on this, IMS implements functionalities to resolve policy inconsistencies and to verify policy reachability. Meanwhile, IMS achieves comprehensive and prompt dynamicity processing. IMS fulfils the verification and dynamicity processing requirements of intent-driven systems. We implement a prototype and evaluations show that the processing time of IMS functionalities scales linearly with the number of policies, and the average endpoint dynamicity processing time is 5.05 ms in the setup of 1,000 endpoints, illustrating that IMS is scalable and can process dynamicity promptly.}

	abstract = {Cache side-channel attacks have become more sophisticated and more destructive to the security of computer architectures and cloud platforms than ever before, resulting in the leakage of privacy information. Prior efforts focused on designing countermeasures instead of timely detection. To address the challenges introduced by cache side-channel attacks, anomaly detection and feature detection were proposed. However, these methods have drawbacks in terms of computational performance and detection effectiveness. In this article, we proposed Cache Side-Channel Attack Detector(CSCAD), a novel tool for detecting cache side-channel attacks against memory events in real time. Specifically, we design a collector using Hardware Performance Counters and use improved Maximum Information Coefficient to generate feature vectors. Meanwhile, an adaptive genetic algorithm with crossover and mutation probability is proposed to optimize hyperparameters of LightGBM. Additionally, an adaptive loss function weight model with low overhead is introduced to enhance efficiency of attack detection. It is encouraging to see that CSCAD achieved a recall of 98.14%. In detecting 1000 samples, it boosted the detection speed by approximately 75% compared to conventional machine learning methods. CSCAD has outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously achieving excellent detection speed and effectiveness.}

In this paper, we propose, design, and evaluate GoCrowd, a system framework for obliviously aggregating wisdom with quality assurance in crowdsourcing. At its core, we propose constructions for two procedures. The starting point is a gold-standard based private worker quality control procedure that provides privacy-friendly worker quality assurance under the widely popular gold-standard mechanism. The subsequent procedure is an oblivious wisdom aggregation procedure that obliviously learns aggregate statistics over workers’ data while considering their quality. We securely realize these procedures with only lightweight secret sharing techniques. Our system is utterly oblivious to the service provider, and ensures that only the requester can learn the aggregate quality-aware statistics but nothing more. Extensive evaluations show that GoCrowd can produce quality statistics over data from 500 workers for 200 16-choice questions within 1 s.}

Blockchain interoperability addresses isolatability between heterogeneous blockchains, while sharding-based blockchain achieves scalability by solving isolatability of homogeneous blockchains running in different shards. To ensure atomicity between different blockchains, they both need to overcome two significant problems: 1) how to handle cross-chain transactions without trusting any third parties; 2) how to enhance the resistance to double-spending attacks of participating blockchains. To this end, this work presents a two-tier multi-zone architecture, Distributed and Parallel Blockchain (DP-Chain), where Consensus Zone in tier-1 features blockchain interoperability and sharding-based blockchain by allowing homogeneous or heterogeneous blockchains run in different zones, while Coordination Layer in tier-2 allows them to interoperate as a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) without trusting any third parties. Meanwhile, the coordination scheme between the two tiers is designed to resist potential double-spending attacks. Then, stochastic models are used to capture DP-Chain consensus process and analyze the probability of successful double-spending attacks. These analyses can help understand DP-Chain easily and offer theoretical guidelines for further implementations. Finally, based on the proposed architecture, a practical system is realized with C++ and open in Github for testing. Extensive experiments show correctness and effectiveness of this design.}

However, most of the existing methods manually extract or learn features from raw traffic, which is usually expensive, complicated, and time-consuming. Moreover, this also brings unprecedented challenges for preserving users’ privacy in the communication process, making it difficult for existing solutions to be deployed in practice due to the privacy requirements from legal policies. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving graph neural network (named NIGNN) for NIDS, which can encode the local structure and traffic features. To address the privacy issues pertaining to the application of graph representation learning, we design a privacy message-passing mechanism with formal privacy guarantees, in which sensitive information potentially contained in graph vertices will be kept private. Specifically, we design a privacy-enhancement graph representation that introduces a degree-sensitive item in vertex-based aggregation to reduce noise. Our theoretical analysis shows that NIGNN can provide a provable privacy guarantee. Extensive experiments demonstrate NIGNN's performance in maintaining a sound privacy-accuracy trade-off.}

In this paper, we propose Waston, a low-cost system for radar mode detection and parameter estimation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radars. To overcome the disadvantage of low sampling frequency of COTS mmWave radars, we design two special local signals to detect frequency points and spectral shapes for radar mode detection. We propose a novel parameter estimation algorithm to estimate frequency- and time-domain parameters for spoofing different radars. We have implemented a prototype on the TI AWR1843 platform and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Waston. Our experimental results demonstrate that Waston achieves an accuracy of 100 \\% \\%  for mode detection and 99 \\% \\%  for parameter estimation.

	abstract = {The lack of privacy-preserving capabilities hinders the further development of blockchains and smart contracts. While numerous privacy solutions have been proposed, limitations persist. First, most existing solutions focus on specific privacy protections such as anonymous payments, private data, or multi-party computation tasks. However, these solutions lack a general privacy ability, allowing users to deploy applications with diverse privacy requirements. Second, existing solutions have limited customizability, which means users cannot easily customize and adapt the privacy policies according to their specific demands or preferences. In this article, we present EtherCloak, which adopts trusted execution environments (TEEs) to achieve a general and customizable privacy policy on account model blockchains, enabling users to conceal any on-chain information. To address the security issues caused by the unreliability of the host the TEE runs on, we design the enclave state check and crash recovery mechanisms and employ them in the block generation process. In addition, we propose an access control mechanism for privacy policy management and data query. We prove that EtherCloak offers general and customizable privacy protection with a minimal increase in transaction size (less than triple) and communication overhead (approximately 10%) compared to Ethereum.}

	abstract = {Recruiting users in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can make the platform obtain high-quality data to provide better services. Although the privacy leakage during the process of user recruitment has received a lot of research attention, none of the existing work considers the evaluation of the sensing quality of privacy-preserving data submitted by users, which makes the platform incapable of recruiting users suitably to obtain high-quality sensing data, thereby reducing the reliability of MCS services. To solve this problem, we first propose a sensing quality evaluation method based on the deviation and variance of sensing data. According to it, the platform can obtain the sensing quality of privacy-preserving data for each user during the recruitment. Then we model the user recruitment with a limited budget platform as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) game to determine the recruited users based on the sensing quality of data obtained by evaluation. Finally, we theoretically prove that our algorithm satisfies differential privacy and the upper bound on the regret of rewards is restricted. Experimental results show that our proposal is superior in various properties, and our method has a 73.67% advantage in accumulated sensing qualities compared with comparison schemes.}

	abstract = {The backdoor attack has emerged as a prevalent threat that affects the effectiveness of machine learning models in intelligent vehicles. While such attacks may not impair the normal performance of the trained model, they can be exploited by malicious entities to manipulate model inferences, resulting in serious problems. In this paper, we design a dynamic gradient clipping (DGC) method aimed at rectifying backdoor models by eliminating the underlying backdoor trigger. Firstly, we construct a repair dataset fused by some clean samples and few-shot backdoor samples to amplify the backdoor behavior when we only obtain limited backdoor samples. Subsequently, we introduce sample states to characterize the backdoor behavior of the target model, determined by the model's inference outcome. Finally, we devise the DGC method to clip parameter gradients at varying degrees, effectively eliminating the backdoor trigger within the target model. Through the evaluation, the simulation results demonstrate that our DGC method exhibits robust defense capabilities against four contemporary state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, reducing the attack success rate by 95% with only  0.1\\% \\sim 4.8\\% 0.1 % ∼ 4.8 % 0.1\\% \\sim 4.8\\%  model accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {Voice assistants, increasingly integrated into wearable devices with limited human-computer interaction modalities, are susceptible to voice spoofing attacks. Such attacks exploit pre-recorded or synthesized voice commands to trick the assistants into executing actions unauthorized by legitimate users. In this work, we propose GyroTalk, a novel approach extracts individual and reliable features from speech movement sequences of users, using built-in gyroscopes in wearables, to differentiate between legitimate users and malicious attackers. GyroTalk is inspired by two critical insights. First, speech, as a highly intricate motor task, necessitates the synchronized coordination of multiple respiratory, laryngeal, lingual and mandibular muscles. These collective muscle movements propagate throughout the body, providing unique movement signatures. Second, the distinctive speech movement sequences of individual speakers, essential for generating specific words, can be grabbed by embedded IMU of wearables. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of GyroTalk across various COTS Android devices, including smart phones, watches and glasses. Our experimental results demonstrate that GyroTalk can achieve a mean FAR of 2.23% and a FRR of 2.48%, even in the face of complicated voice spoofing attacks.}

In order to resist quantum-attacks, we put forward a post-quantum secure IB-ME scheme. Compared with Ateniese et al.'s scheme and Francati et al.'s scheme, our approach eliminates the use of functional encryption, predicate encryption and signature scheme, and only uses a more simple preimage sampling function and an IBE scheme in the way of non-black-box.

	abstract = {Anti-forensics seeks to eliminate or conceal traces of tampering artifacts. Typically, anti-forensic methods are designed to deceive binary detectors and persuade them to misjudge the authenticity of an image. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made to deceive forgery detectors at the pixel level and mis-locate forged regions. Traditional adversarial attack methods cannot be directly used against forgery localization due to the following defects: 1) they tend to just naively induce the target forensic models to flip their pixel-level pristine or forged decisions; 2) their anti-forensics performance tends to be severely degraded when faced with the unseen forensic models; 3) they lose validity once the target forensic models are retrained with the anti-forensics images generated by them. To tackle the three defects, we propose SEAR (Self-supErvised Anti-foRensics), a novel self-supervised and adversarial training algorithm that effectively trains deep-learning anti-forensic models against forgery localization. SEAR sets a pretext task to reconstruct perturbation for self-supervised learning. In adversarial training, SEAR employs a forgery localization model as a supervisor to explore tampering features and constructs a deep-learning concealer to erase corresponding traces. We have conducted large-scale experiments across diverse datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, through the combination of self-supervised learning and adversarial learning, SEAR successfully deceives the state-of-the-art forgery localization methods, as well as tackle the three defects regarding traditional adversarial attack methods mentioned above.}

	abstract = {The co-verification of safety and security is a necessary process for safety- and security-critical distributed applications, but conflicts exist between safety and security. The state-of-the-art Block-based Vulnerability Pre-assignment (BVP) and Reversed Block-based Time Pre-assignment (RBTP) co-verification techniques of safety and security have three main limitations: 1) only co-verifying the boundary values and ignoring the verification of non-boundary values; 2) algorithm redundancy (i.e., BVP and RBTP must be used simultaneously) makes the verification process complex and cumbersome; and 3) only one safety attribute and one security attribute participate in the co-verification. In this study, we explore the causal mechanisms for the mutual influence between safety and security: 1) they compete with each other in relation to Worst Case Execution Time (WCET); 2) there is a lack of cooperation between the two; and 3) both are pursuing maximum performance for each individual. Above causal mechanisms precisely conforms to the problem of maximizing benefits in non-cooperative games (i.e., Nash equilibrium). Therefore, we propose the Fast Game Verification (FGV) based on non-cooperative game to co-verify reliability in safety and confidentiality in security. FGV achieves non-boundary value co-verification and avoids redundancy. We develop Fast Game Verification plus plus (FGV++) algorithm to co-verify multiple safety attributes and multiple security attributes. We conduct actual cases of distributed applications. In terms of the co-verification of two attributes, FGV demonstrates average acceptance rate of 59.96% within 0.638 s, surpassing both BVP&RBTP by 6.94% (within 0.812 s); FGV++ achieves average acceptance rate of 58.73% within 0.663 s, exhibiting a 4.53% advantage over BVP and RBTP. In the co-verification of four attributes, the average acceptance rate of FGV++ has increased to 61.07% within 1.34102 s.}

	abstract = {Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.}

	abstract = {Private set union (PSU) has been an emerging topic in recent years due to its variety of applications. In particular, we are interested in deploying PSU in a cloud setting such that two players, the sender and the receiver, may outsource their sets to the cloud and update their sets. Later, the receiver can submit a union query to the cloud and learn the union of the sets without knowing the intersection. Of course, there is no need to restrict this scenario to only two players. A PSU operation that satisfies these properties is called updatable delegated PSU (UD-PSU). Despite the apparent usefulness of such operations, no related research, even on delegated PSU, has been conducted since Abadi et al. (TDSC 2017) posed the open problem of constructing a delegated PSU protocol. In this work, we address the above problem by presenting the first protocol for multiparty UD-PSU. Our starting point is Abadi et al.'s protocol (FC 2022) for multiparty updatable delegated private set intersection (a.k.a. Feather) built on a polynomial representation of the intersection of sets. The challenging hurdle for delegated PSU is to obtain a polynomial representation of the union of sets without revealing any information about the sets beyond the result. We develop a delegated PSU protocol by exploiting a rational polynomial representation. We then extend this basic protocol to support update operations, i.e., UD-PSU. Second, we improve the update efficiency of the resulting UD-PSU protocol to  \\tilde{O}(n\\log {p}) \\tilde{O}(n\\log {p}) , which works on polynomials of degree  n n  over finite fields of order  p p . Finally, we implement our protocol in C++ and perform a comprehensive evaluation varying the cardinality of the sets and the number of players. Interestingly, the experimental results demonstrate that our protocol is comparable to Feather in overall performance. In particular, our update protocol shows an 8–12× improvement relative to Feather's update.}

	abstract = {Container environments provide cloud native applications with scalability, flexibility, and portable support. As a popular container orchestrator, Kubernetes facilitates automatic deployment and maintenance of a large number of containerized applications. However, potential misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or implementation flaws may empower attackers to exploit the Kubernetes cluster. Although existing solutions such as runtime security policy enforcement may prevent an attack, they can be inefficient in large scale container environments. In this paper, we propose a performance profiling-based proactive security policy enforcement solution, namely, PerfSPEC. First, we accelerate the proactivization of policies (which typically requires significant manual effort) by proposing to profile and rank existing policies according to their induced overhead. This allows us to better focus our efforts and greatly improve the overall response time (e.g., by 98% in contrast to less than 49%). Then, we address the performance limitations of existing solutions by leveraging learning-based approaches to predict future events and compute their verification results in advance. As a result, PerfSPEC achieves a viable response time (e.g., less than 10 ms in contrast to 600 ms with one of the most popular existing approaches) even for large container environments (up to 800 Pods).}

	abstract = {Federated Learning is an emerging distributed algorithm that is designed to collaboratively train the global model without accessing clients’ private data. However, heterogeneity of data among clients leads to significant degradation in model performance. Some studies suggest adopting model regularization and using generators to enrich datasets with diverse features can effectively enhance model performance. But current research focuses on regularizing specific modules of the model, failing to achieve regularization across the entire model, and offering limited mitigation of bias from heterogeneous data. Moreover, few methods consider that generators often produce samples with simple features, and the direct use for generating raw data can raise privacy concerns. To solve these challenges, we propose a generator-based heterogeneous Federated Prototype Adversarial Learning framework, named FedPA, which combines prototype learning and lightweight generators to achieve regularization of the entire model. Our generators are designed to generate features rather than raw data, and use prototype learning to find the hard features in an adversarial learning manner, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results show that FedPA improves test accuracy by 3.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating that FedPA can effectively mitigate model bias.}

The key issue is that the platform adopts two different permission assignments on the app side and the cloud side, and these two assignments must maintain consistency in authorizing. Unfortunately, real-world smart home platforms may not be able to ensure this when implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model. The inconsistency between these assignments may lead to security vulnerabilities, which can be easily exploited by malicious users. Although many existing studies have revealed security issues with smart home platforms, less attention has been paid to the sharing feature and permission assignments, as well as security issues that arise from this. In this work, we conducted a systematic study on the RBAC model and permission management of smart home platforms. To overcome technical challenges imposed by the “black-box” platform, we also proposed a novel testing framework. By testing 10 smart home platforms that all belong to the “device-connected, black-box, and multi-user supported” category, we collected each platform's “configurable permission assignment” and inferred “enforced permission assignment”. At last, we identified 44 inconsistencies that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Malicious users could exploit these vulnerabilities to initiate attacks such as device hijacking, unauthorized access, illegal control, and eavesdropping. We promptly reported these vulnerabilities to vendors and CNVD, and proposed mitigation measures.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of learning privacy-preserving graph representations with graph neural networks (GNNs). Different from existing works based on adversarial training, we introduce a variational approach, called vGPF, to encourage the isolation of sensitive attributes from the learned representations. Specifically, we first formulate a non-asymptotic information-theoretic problem for characterizing the best achievable privacy subject to the utility constraints of graph representations, termed as Graph Privacy Funnel (GPF). Then we theoretically analyze that the GPF objective can be directly optimized over through a variational approximation upper bound. vGPF allows us to parameterize the privacy-preserving graph mapping with GNN encoders and use the reparameterization trick for training. Compared with existing adversarial approaches, vGPF exhibits more stable predictive performance as it does not rely on an additional adversarial network that may incur training stability in practice. Experiments across multiple datasets from various domains demonstrate that vGPF outperforms its state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of predictive accuracy, performance stability, and robustness to attribute inference attacks. We also show that vGPF enjoys high flexibility in the sense that it is compatible with various graph learning tasks with different GNN encoder architectures, and it can enforce privacy over any combinations of sensitive attributes in one shot.}

	abstract = {An attribute-based credential (ABC) system allows a user, obtaining a credential on a set of attributes from an issuer, to anonymously prove a subset of attributes to a service provider. Nowadays, delegation is an important requirement of ABC, which allows a user to delegate his credentials to other users. However, traditional delegatable ABC systems only support delegating a credential with all attributes. In many scenarios, an appropriate delegation is a user can delegate his credential on parts of attributes to others. Another requirement is revocation of credentials in case of unexpected events. In this article, we propose a delegatable and revocable attribute-based credential, which simultaneously achieves: (1) a user can delegate a credential on parts of attributes to other entities (devices/users); (2) a user can efficiently revoke his credentials or those delegated by him; (3) a user can selectively disclose some attributes and also can prove that the non-disclosed attributes satisfy some relations. To achieve our delegatable and revocable attribute-based credential, we introduce a new primitive, called purgeable signature (PS). We formally define the security model of PS. We then give an efficient construction with a constant-size signature and present the security proofs of PS. Finally, the experimental results show the efficiency of our system.}

	abstract = {As a collaborative and open network, billions of devices can be free to join the IoT-based data collection network for data perception and transmission. Along with this trend, more and more malicious attackers enter the network, they steal or tamper with data, and hinder data exchange and communication. To address these issues, we propose a Proactive Trust Evaluation System (PTES) for secure data collection by evaluating the trust of mobile data collectors. Specifically, PTES guarantees evaluation accuracy from trust evidence acquisition, trust evidence storage, and trust value calculation. First, PTES obtains trust evidence based on active detection of drones, feedbacks from interacted objects, and recommendations from trusted third parties. Then, these trust evidences are stored according to interaction time by adopting a sliding window mechanism. After that, credible, untrustworthy, and uncertain evidence sequences are extracted from the storage space, and assigned with positive, negative, and tendentious trust values, respectively. Consequently, the final normalized trust is obtained by combining the three trust values. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate PTES is superior to benchmark methods in terms of detection accuracy and profit.}

	abstract = {Encrypted database is an emerging and promising technology. It is able to run SQL operations on encrypted data. However, most existing encrypted databases have no data interoperability, i.e., the output of an operator (e.g., addition) cannot be taken as input of another (e.g., comparison). As a result, these encrypted databases can only support simple queries like addition, multiplication and comparison, but unable to support a composition of these simple queries (e.g., SELECT user_id FROM salary WHERE  V_{1} + V_{2} > 5000 V_{1} + V_{2} > 5000 V1+V2>5000). In SIGMOD ’14, Wong et al. propose SDB, which to the best of our knowledge is the only encrypted database that achieves data interoperability. Unfortunately, it has recently been broken (VLDB ’21). In this paper, we propose a novel encrypted database named SDB+. It achieves data interoperability based on a suit of sophisticated designs. We formally prove that SDB+ achieves indistinguishability under chosen query attacks (IND-CQA). We provide a full-fledged implementation and run it on three benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SDB+ achieves comparable efficiency with SDB, even though the latter is insecure.}

	abstract = {The escalating prevalence of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) malware demands more effective methods to accurately attribute malware to specific APT groups. Traditional manual attribution processes are labor-intensive and error-prone, while existing automated methods are hampered by small dataset sizes, inadequate representation learning, and poor noise reduction during preprocessing. To address these challenges, we introduce the AMG25 dataset, which expands the pool of malware samples labeled with APT group affiliations. Concurrently, we propose the MGAP3 model (Malware Group Attribution based on PerceiverIO and Polytype Pre-training), which enhances attribution performance by incorporating hierarchical pre-training for disassembled codes and leveraging multi-view statistical features, all within a unified PerceiverIO architecture. This model adeptly captures complex program structures and interactions cross multiple code granularities, through a series of innovative polytype pre-training tasks. Additionally, we have developed a novel noise filtering technique that focuses on user-defined function codes, substantially reducing overfitting and boosting performance. Furthermore, a streamlined version of the model, MGAP3-Lite, has been developed to accelerate training while preserving robust performance. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our models and underscored the importance of the proposed pre-training technique.}

	abstract = {Due to the widespread use and proliferation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), safeguarding their Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) has become increasingly important. This article proposes a method for watermarking a cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically CycleGAN, to address the gap between the watermarking of conventional GAN models and cyclic GAN watermarking. The proposed method involves training a watermark decoder, which is then frozen and used to extract the watermark bits during the training of the CycleGAN model. The model is trained using specific loss functions that are optimized to achieve excellent performance on both the Image-to-Image Translation (I2IT) task and watermark embedding. Besides, a comprehensive theoretical and practical statistical analysis to verify the ownership of the model from the extracted watermark bits is given. At last, the model's robustness is evaluated against image post-processing, and further improved by fine-tuning the watermark decoder by applying data augmentation to the generated images before extracting the watermark bits. We also verify the robustness of the watermark to surrogate model attacks, carried out by accessing the watermarked model in a black-box modality. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and robust against image post-processing and can resist surrogate model attacks.}

An online mixed-design study ( n=604 n=604 ) shows that adding our highlighting technique outperforms existing warning solutions. It also identifies the relative efficacy of different appeals and the characteristics of susceptible users. Results show that adding our highlighting technique is useful even with false positives and false negatives. Inspired by this result, we propose an automatic warning generator.

Unlike existing techniques that depend on specific time windows, our approach automatically determines the optimal number of packets to generate unique signatures, making it more resilient to network jitters. We evaluate the effectiveness, uniqueness, and correctness of our signatures by training and testing our system using four public datasets and an emulated dataset with varying network delays, verifying known signatures and discovering new ones. Our system achieved an average recall and precision of 98-99% and 98-100%, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of using packet-level signatures to detect IoT device activities.}

In this paper, we first revisit the nature of the watermarking trade-off triangle for the DNN case, then we exploit our findings to propose a white-box, multi-bit watermarking method achieving very large payload and strong robustness against network modification. In the proposed system, the weights hosting the watermark are set prior to training, making sure that their amplitude is large enough to bear the target payload and survive network modifications, notably retraining, and are left unchanged throughout the training process. The distribution of the weights carrying the watermark is theoretically optimised to ensure the secrecy of the watermark and make sure that the watermarked weights are indistinguishable from the non-watermarked ones. The proposed method can achieve outstanding performance, with no significant impact on network accuracy, including robustness against network modifications, retraining and transfer learning, while ensuring a payload which is out of reach of state of the art methods achieving a lower - or at most comparable - robustness.}

However, most existing works do not consider that requester's payments are unknown prior, and assume that workers are honest, which may not be true in practice. To address these problems, we propose a novel Truthful and Dual-direction Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (TD-CMAB) scheme, which maximizes the total profit of the dual-direction platform for both the worker side and the requester side. Specifically, for the worker side, to overcome the problem that the platform is not clear whether sensed data are true, we propose a worker recruitment strategy that identifies and recruits honest workers at low cost through the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm based on truth data discovery. For the requester side, where requesters’ payments are unknown prior, we model requester selection as a CMAB problem and solve it by the proposed adaptive UCB algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the worst regret bound of the TD-CMAB. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the TD-CMAB scheme through extensive experiments using the Beijing taxi dataset.}

It plays a significant role in securing Web applications against web attacks. However, as web attacks grow in sophistication, it is becoming increasingly difficult for WAFs to block the mutated malicious payloads designed to bypass their defenses. In response to this critical security issue, we have developed a novel learning-based framework called WAFBooster, designed to unveil potential bypasses in WAF detections and suggest rules to fortify their security. Using a combination of shadow models and payload generation techniques, we can identify malicious payloads and remove or modify them as needed. WAFBooster generates signatures for these malicious payloads using advanced clustering and regular expression matching techniques to repair any security gaps we uncover. In our comprehensive evaluation of eight real-world WAFs, WAFBooster improved the true rejection rate of mutated malicious payloads from 21% to 96%, with no false rejections. WAFBooster achieves a false acceptance rate 3× lower than State-of-the-Art methods for generating malicious payloads. With WAFBooster, we have taken a step forward in securing web applications against the ever-evolving threats.}

	abstract = {The Execute-Order-Validate blockchain enhances performance by allowing parallel transaction execution, yet it also introduces transaction conflicts that can cause state inconsistencies in the ledger. Previous research has focused on resolving conflicts under the assumption of the “good” intent of the senders. In this paper, we explore an unstudied scenario where a malicious user can intentionally generate transaction collisions to disrupt the service request of a target user to the underlying decentralized application (DApp). We call it manipulated transaction collision (MTC) attack. We overcome the challenges of identifying the conditions and best strategies to launch this targeted attack under various network settings. Our experiment results show that the MTC attack can effectively cause the victim to be continuously rejected by the blockchain, i.e., over 90% success rate in all tested cases on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. To combat this new threat, we first propose a machine-learning-assisted detection method that helps identify the adversarial behavior within massive background traffic. To further enhance blockchain resilience, we propose a more precise transaction conflicts definition and present a novel mitigation method, which not only prevents the attack but also significantly reduces the probability of natural conflicts by up to 75% in the tested DApp compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.}

	abstract = {Logs record various operations and events during system running in text format, which is an essential basis for detecting and identifying potential security threats or system failures, and is widely used in system management to ensure security and reliability. Existing log sequence anomaly detection is limited by log parsing and does not consider all key features of logs, which may cause false or missed detection. In this article, we propose a fast and accurate log parsing method and feed the entire log content into the deep learning network for analysis. To avoid semantic loss during parsing, we replace some variables with tokens containing semantic information and divide logs with appropriate granularity. To ensure the speed and accuracy of parsing, we propose a similarity-based fast merging method to deal with redundant templates. For anomaly detection, we use the complete log content features as input to the model. We use Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) to output anomaly detection results directly after considering both the global and local information of log sequences. Experiments show that our log parsing method achieves the best average parsing quality on 16 datasets, and the anomaly detection method achieves optimal results on different datasets.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces Carbon, a high-throughput system enabling asynchronous (safe) and consensus-free (efficient) payments and votes within a dynamic set of clients. Carbon is operated by a dynamic set of validators that may be reconfigured asynchronously, offering its clients eclipse resistance as well as lightweight bootstrap. Carbon offers clients the ability to select validators by voting them in and out of the system thanks to its novel asynchronous and stake-less voting mechanism. Carbon relies on an asynchronous and deterministic implementation of Byzantine reliable broadcast that uniquely leverages a permissionless set of untrusted servers, brokers, to slash the cost of client authentication inherent to Byzantine fault tolerant systems. Carbon is able to sustain a throughput of one million payments per second in a geo-distributed environment, outperforming the state of the art by three orders of magnitude with equivalent latencies.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) realizes distributed machine learning training via sharing model updates rather than raw data, thus ensuring data privacy. However, an attacker may infer the client's local original data from the model parameter so that original data leakage can be caused. While Differential Privacy (DP) is designed to address data leakage issues in FL, injecting noises during training reduces model accuracy. To minimize the negative impact caused by noises on model accuracy while considering privacy protections, in this article we propose an adaptive FL model, entitled RDP-based Adaptive Federated Learning in Shuffle model (RAFLS). To ensure the dataset privacy of clients, we inject adaptive noises into the client's local model by leveraging the adaptive layer-wise adaptive sensitivity of the local model. Our approach shuffles all local model parameters in order to address privacy explosion concerns caused by high-dimensional aggregation and multiple iterations. We further propose a fine-grained model weight aggregation scheme to aggregate all local models and obtain a global model. Our experiment evaluations demonstrate the proposed RAFLS has a better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in reducing noise's impact on model accuracy while protecting data, i.e., showing that the accuracy of RAFLS increases by 1.54% than that of the baseline scheme when  \\epsilon = 2.0 \\epsilon = 2.0  and FashionMNIST under IID setting.}

Meanwhile, wearable popularity offers a unique chance to capture novel biometrics via embedded sensors. In this article, we study new intracorporal biometrics combining the uniqueness of heart motion, bone conduction, and body asymmetry. Specifically, we introduce HeartPrint, a passive yet secure user authentication system exploiting the bone-conducted heart sounds captured by (widely available) dual in-ear microphones (IEMs). To eliminate interference, we devise a novel method combining modified non-negative matrix factorization and adaptive filtering. This extracts clean heart sounds while addressing interference of body sounds and audio produced by the earphones. We further explore the uniqueness of IEM-recorded heart sounds in three aspects to extract a novel biometric representation, based on which HeartPrint leverages a convolutional neural model equipped with a continual learning method to achieve accurate authentication under drifting body conditions. Furthermore, user-friendly registration and energy-effective authentication are facilitated by a data augmentation method using transformer-based GAN and an authentication interval control method. Extensive experiments with 45 participants confirm that HeartPrint can achieve 1.6% FAR and 1.8% FRR, while effectively coping with major attacks, complicated interference, and hardware diversity, while exhibiting robustness in real-world environments.}

However, existing cryptographic schemes fall short in simultaneously satisfying security requirements such as bilateral fine-grained access control, resilience to quantum attacks, assurance of the authenticity of decrypted data, and forward security for historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose the innovative puncturable attribute-based matchmaking encryption scheme based on lattice cryptography. The method adeptly satisfies the aforementioned stringent security requirements concurrently, offering a triple-layered assurance for the secure implementation of secret sharing. The receiver, unable to successfully decrypt, remains uninformed about any specifics regarding ciphertexts and the access policy. Our PM-ABE scheme has manifested resilience against quantum attacks, collusion attacks, chosen plaintext attacks and ensuring unforgeability under chosen message attacks. Furthermore, our comprehensive efficiency analysis substantiates that our scheme maintains a favorable level of computational efficiency and storage consumption.}

The Money Flow Graph (MFG) serves as the foundation for various behavioral analysis, malicious activity detection, and money flow tracing tasks. However, traditional graph databases face the issue of storage requirement and performance when analyzing large-scale MFGs. In this work, we present MFGScope, a lightweight domain-specific framework designed for graph-based analysis on EVM-compatible blockchains, with extensive optimizations for storage efficiency and query performance. The prototype of MFGScope for the Ethereum network achieves the storage of over 3 billion transfers and 1.7 billion relevant transactions in a single instance with less than 450 GB of disk usage. The evaluation shows that for common tasks, MFGScope is more than 30 times faster and requires 78% less storage space than the commonly used graph database Neo4j. For the applications of MFGScope, we present several use cases based on the MFG which cannot be performed efficiently using traditional graph databases and report interesting findings. To engage the community, the prototype of MFGScope for the Ethereum blockchain with the complete dataset will be open source.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has made remarkable achievements in medical and e-healthcare services. Different healthcare institutions can jointly train models to facilitate intelligent diagnosis. However, the model gradients transmitted among these institutions may still leak private information about the local models and training datasets. Additionally, in the current FL schemes, institutions with different quantities or qualities of medical data usually get the same training models, which may significantly hamper their motivation. Therefore, ensuring privacy and fairness in collaborative training remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-enhanced and fair FL scheme (EPFFL) to support distributed large-scale data sharing of e-healthcare services. In the training process, participants upload the encrypted model gradients according to their sharing wishes to the blockchain while storing their training data locally. Hence, the FL initiator can only get the aggregated gradients from the blockchain rather than the local data of other participants. Moreover, EPFFL ensures fairness by evaluating the participants’ contributions, i.e., participants with different data qualities and sharing levels can obtain the final models with different accuracies at the end of the training. Through theoretical and simulation analysis, the scheme shows superior functionalities on privacy preservation and fairness with the ideal model accuracy.}

Existing defenses against MIAs include preprocessing the training data of the model, modifying loss functions, and perturbing the inference output. However, all these mechanisms have to change either the training or inference process, which might be out of reach of the defenders, especially when the models are deployed in a third-party cloud service. In this article, we propose preprocessing the query samples before feeding them into the models for inference. Specifically, we design a Membership Cleanser module to remove the member information in the query sample by moving it closer to non-member area in the feature space. The membership cleanser does not modify the training or inference process of the machine learning model, so it can be applied to any machine learning system. Through extensive evaluation on four datasets against different models, our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art defense mechanisms in resilience and practicality against various MIAs while retaining good inference accuracy.}

However, cryptographic tools are characterized by huge overhead, which results in the MLaaS quality being unbearably degraded, especially for latency-sensitive MLaaS applications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of low-latency inference associated with MLaaS and propose CrossNet, a Privacy-preserving Neural Network Inference (PPNI) framework based on FHE, for applications with limited client-side computational and communication resources. CrossNet performs model transformations on neural networks so that they can be evaluated in an FHE-friendly manner. Model transformation introduces limited interactions between client and server, thus restricting inference latency. In addition, CrossNet includes a series of layer constructions where elaborate encoding forms and computational orders are designed to further reduce the overhead of transformed layers. CrossNet outperforms the existing FHE-based frameworks by 4x efficiency and reduces nearly 30% inference latency on ResNet-50 in a resource-limited setting.}

Nevertheless, the payment channel risks encountering fund depletion, which threatens the availability of off-chain payments. The most recent method needs a cycle-based channel rebalancing procedure, which requires a fair leader and users with rebalancing demands forming directed cycles in the network. Therefore, its large-scale applications are restricted. Moreover, the privacy issue is not considered, leading to the leakage of rebalancing information. In this work, we introduce Shaduf++, a novel non-cycle off-chain rebalancing protocol that offers a new solution for users to shift coins among any channels to which they belong directly without relying on the cycle setting, and therefore could be applied to more general rebalancing scenarios. Furthermore, utilizing the cryptography primitives, including the commitment and the range proof schemes, Shaduf++ preserves the privacy for the rebalancing operations. We provide the details of Shaduf++ and formally prove its security under the Universal Composability framework. Our prototype demonstrates its feasibility and the experimental evaluation shows that Shaduf++ enhances the Lighting Network performance in payment success ratio and volume.}

Since data confidentiality requirements exist, data owners should encrypt their PHRs in advance of transmitting them to a cloud server. Attribute-based encryption with keyword search (ABKS) technique ensures that the encrypted PHRs are able to retrieved by other data users whose attributes match access polices granted by data owners. However, access polices are public in most existing ABKS schemes, which can reveal sensitive information contained in PHRs. In this article, we provide an efficient ABKS scheme with policy hiding for PHRs that implements the following features. (1) The fine-grained access control is achieved where data owners can authorize which data users can retrieve encrypted PHRs. (2) The access policy is hidden to safeguard sensitive information from being leaked. (3) The costs of storage and computation do not grow linearly as the number of attributes increases. The security of the presented ABKS scheme is reduced to the truncated  q q q -DABDHE assumption and the DDH assumption. Its performance is also demonstrated by our extensive simulation experiments.}

	abstract = {Machine unlearning enables pre-trained models to remove the effect of certain portions of training data. Previous machine unlearning schemes have mainly focused on unlearning a cluster of instances or all instances belonging to a specific class. These types of unlearning might have a significant impact on the model utility; and they may be inadequate for situations where we only need to unlearn features within instances, rather than the whole instances. Due to the different granularity, current unlearning methods can hardly achieve feature-level unlearning. To address the challenges of utility and granularity, we propose a refined granularity unlearning scheme referred to as “feature unlearning”. We first explore two distinct scenarios based on whether the annotation information about the features is given: feature unlearning with known annotations and feature unlearning without annotations. Regarding unlearning with known annotations, we propose an adversarial learning approach to automatically remove effects about features. For unlearning without annotations, we initially enable the output of one model's layer to identify different pattern features using model interpretability techniques. We proceed to filter features from instances based on these outputs with identifying ability. So that we can remove the feature impact based on filtered instances and the fine-tuning process. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments involving diverse models on various datasets in different scenarios.}

While some solutions based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) have been proposed to address these issues, they still face practical challenges such as attribute privacy leakage, resource-constrained devices, dynamic user groups, inflexible and inefficient service response. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving fine-grained data sharing scheme with dynamic service (PF2DS), which implements access control by calculating the inner product between an attribute vector and an access vector. PF2DS is also capable of providing dynamic user group services through an efficient and indirect user revocation mechanism that periodically updates the key-embedded leaf nodes. Building on PF2DS, edge-assisted PF2DS (EPF2DS) delegates most of the operations to the edge device, which facilitates the performance of resource-constrained IoT devices. EPF2DS also supports efficient and asynchronous keyword search over the ciphertexts stored in the cloud. We demonstrate the security by the rigorous security proof. Both theoretical comparisons and experimental simulations demonstrate the practicality and superiority of our schemes over existing works.}

	abstract = {Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) offers powerful data analytics services to clients with limited resources. However, it still raises concerns about the integrity of delegated computation and the privacy of the server's model parameters. To address these issues, zero-knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) has been suggested for computation verifiability with privacy guarantee for ML models. Nevertheless, the existing zkML schemes focus on only one classical ML classification algorithm or deep neural networks, which may not achieve satisfactory accuracy or require large-scale training data and model parameters, thus limiting their usefulness in certain applications. In this article, we propose ezDPS, an efficient and zero-knowledge scheme for classical ML inference that processes data in multiple stages for improved accuracy. Unlike prior works, each stage of the ezDPS pipeline is based on a well-established classical ML algorithm, including Discrete Wavelet Transformation, Zero-Score Normalization, Principal Components Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. We design new gadgets to prove various ML operations effectively. Our implementation of ezDPS has been fully tested on real datasets, and experimental results show that it is up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than generic circuit-based approaches, while also maintaining greater accuracy than single ML classification approaches.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of taint-style vulnerabilities in embedded devices poses a significant threat to cybersecurity. However, discovering these vulnerabilities is challenging due to their vast number and variety. While current solutions for discovering vulnerabilities in embedded firmware have achieved some success, they suffer from imprecision, are time-consuming, and fail to consider sensitive sinks and constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taint-style vulnerability discovery method called SinkTaint. SinkTaint incorporates backtracking and constraint analysis to achieve high precision and employs a global taint keyword identification strategy to identify implicit taint keywords. It identifies additional sinks using static analysis and performs backtracking analysis to eliminate sanitized sinks, while retrieving the parameter's length for risky sinks. Furthermore, SinkTaint employs dual-label labeling strategies for taint keywords and data, propagating taint labels based on function return values. Finally, SinkTaint employs symbolic execution-based taint analysis to discover taint-style vulnerabilities. We evaluate SinkTaint on datasets released by SaTC and 10 known overflow vulnerabilities. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, including Karonte, SaTC, and EmTaint, SinkTaint demonstrated superior performance, discovering more vulnerabilities with an increase in vulnerability discovery effectiveness by 472%. To date, SinkTaint has identified 21 high-risk taint-style vulnerabilities that were previously undisclosed.}

	abstract = {Many security risk assessment models have been proposed to describe and analyze security risks and their dependencies in network systems by means of graphs. However, these models suffer from two significant problems. First, they require a lot of human intervention and expertise in the graph generation process because they assume that experts are responsible for collecting and organizing large amounts of input data necessary for the assessment. Second, they are difficult to apply to large-scale networks since the graph size and the computational cost grow explosively with the network size. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel methodology named malicious communication dependency analysis (Malcoda) for assessing security risks of enterprise networks. Malcoda identifies risks in a network on the basis of input data automatically obtained from existing security products and describes probabilistic dependencies among information assets, threats, and vulnerabilities through a Bayesian network (BN)-based model dubbed the Malco directed acyclic graph (DAG). It then analyzes the Malco DAG to calculate the probability that each asset and vulnerability is exposed to threats (risk probability). Malcoda minimizes human intervention and enables administrators with limited expertise to easily assess security risks by automatically collecting and organizing the input data required for constructing the graphs. The Malco DAG, which is lighter than existing models, significantly reduces the computational cost and improves the scalability. The evaluation of Malcoda implemented in a virtual enterprise network demonstrates that Malcoda can automatically and quickly complete the assessment process and output reasonable risk probabilities reflecting threats, i.e., intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts. The computational complexity of Malcoda is also found to be less than or equal to that of existing models.}

	abstract = {The security risk of semantic attacks to Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) is increasing. Semantic attacks manipulate targeted system modules by identifying the physical semantics of variables in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) programs, i.e., the sensing/actuating modules represented by the variables, which is usually and inefficiently achieved via manual examination of system documents and long-term observation of system behavior. In this paper, we design ARES, a method that Automatically Reverse Engineers the Semantics of variables in PLC programs without requiring any domain knowledge. ARES is built on the fact that the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system monitors the behavior of PLC using a fixed mapping between the variables of program code and data log, and the data log variables are marked with physical semantics. By identifying the mapping between PLC code and SCADA data (i.e., the code-data mapping), ARES reverse engineers the physical semantics of program variables. ARES also sheds light on the preferred defense strategies in implementing control rules that improve the resistance of PLC programs to semantic attacks, as well as in detecting and responding to semantics attacks in real time. We have experimentally evaluated ARES and the recommended defending practices on two ICS platforms.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused significant damage worldwide. Various Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are deployed by enterprises to fight against potential threats. However, EDR suffers from high false positives. In order not to affect normal operations, analysts need to investigate and filter detection results before taking countermeasures, in which heavy manual labor and alarm fatigue cause analysts miss optimal response time, thereby leading to information leakage and destruction. Therefore, we propose Endpoint Forecasting and Interpreting (EFI), a real-time attack forecast and interpretation system, which can automatically predict next move during post-exploitation and explain it in technique-level, then dispatch strategies to EDR for advance reinforcement. First, we use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports to extract the attack scene graph (ASG) that can be mapped to low-level system logs to strengthen attack samples. Second, we build a serialized graph forecast model, which is combined with the attack provenance graph (APG) provided by EDR to generate an attack forecast graph (AFG) to predict the next move. Finally, we utilize the attack template graph (ATG) and graph alignment plus algorithm for technique-level interpretation to automatically dispatch strategies for EDR to reinforce system in advance. EFI can avoid the impact of existing EDR false positives, and can reduce the attack surface of system without affecting the normal operations. We collect a total of 3,484 CTI reports, generate 1,429 ASGs, label 8,000 sentences, tag 10,451 entities, and construct 256 ATGs. Experimental results on both DARPA Engagement and large scale CTI dataset show that the alignment score between the AFG predicted by EFI and the real attack graph is able to exceed 0.8, the forecast and interpretation precision of EFI can reach 91.8%.}

Seeking to contribute to the knowledge gap, we propose a new secure and privacy-preserving scheme for V2V communications. Our proposal is based on a new provably secure certificateless signature scheme with batch verification, which eliminates the need for certificates while ensuring better efficiency. Our performance and security evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach overcomes our previously discussed limitations while achieving both message authentication and conditional privacy. In addition, we also shown that it incurs low overhead.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile apps, developers tend to implement a variety of functionalities to support users’ demands. Thus, they involve the usage of native libraries to fulfill the luxuriant functionalities and maintain fast system responses, instead of using a unitary programming language (i.e., Java). Nonetheless, such an inter-language programming framework also introduces more security issues because attackers can conceal malicious behaviors at the native level to evade Android security vetting. Existing state-of-the-art detection tools mainly rely on the information extracted in the Java code to infer the potential malicious behaviors implemented in native code. None of them could simultaneously study the correlated behaviors in Java and native code. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a static semantic-driven malware detection tool, GNNDroid, to distinguish malware by combining the behaviors implemented in both Java and native code. First, GNNDroid separately analyzes Java and native code to construct Java function call graphs and native function call graphs. It then utilizes a regex-based function recognition approach to explore the correlations between Java code and native code. According to the code correlations, GNNDroid constructs Multi-Relational Directed Graphs (MRDGs) to extract the comprehensive behaviors. Finally, it executes a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) to analyze the MRDGs and distinguish malicious apps. We assessed GNNDroid by analyzing 40,000 Android apps and compared them with state-of-the-art tools. The result demonstrated that GNNDroid not only performs well when analyzing Java+native apps (i.e., apps implemented by both Java and native code), achieving an F1 of 98.57% but also effectively exploits Java only apps (i.e., apps implemented by Java code), achieving an F1 of 96.31%.}

The complexity of the arithmetic circuits, combined with the adaptability to different applications by configurable parameters and run-time reprogramming, presents challenging issues for integrating the accelerator into these systems. The architecture of the accelerator is based on an application-specific instruction processor, which executes a set of constant-time instructions from an internal register file and memories. The role of the embedded processor is reduced to the initial writing of the instruction memory of the accelerator, the launching of the required set of instructions and configuring the Direct Memory Access controller to retrieve and store data from external memory. The run-time programming of the accelerator provides high flexibility in applications that requires post-quantum cryptography. A set of configurable parameters permits to adapt the security level of the McEliece encryption-decryption and the area-performance tradeoff imposed by the target device. Thus, the accelerator can be implemented from low-cost to high-end FPGAs by configuring the data-width of DMA buses or the parallelism level of the Galois-Field adder-multiplier. Experimental results show the accelerator is suited for implementing efficiently the highest security parameters of the Classic McEliece, achieving a McEliece decryption speed-up from x370 to x556 and occupying a small number of resources on a low-cost FPGA. In high-end FPGAs, the accelerator can be configured using higher security parameters not achieved in previous related cryptoprocessors, providing even higher accelerations.}

	abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) employ hardware-based isolation mechanisms to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive code and data. One such prevalent implementation is Arm TrustZone, which partitions the system into the secure and normal (non-secure) worlds. However, this partitioning results in the secure world having very limited visibility into the operating information of the normal world, creating a semantic gap between these two worlds. Specifically, the secure world lacks an effective user identity authentication when receiving data requests from the normal world. Consequently, malicious Client Applications (CAs) in the normal world can deceive Trusted Applications (TAs) in the secure world by utilizing elaborate request parameters, compromising the sensitive data stored by other CAs. We systematically classify these Semantic Gap Vulnerabilities (SGVs) and propose a mate system for the TEE called MaTEE to defend against SGVs. MaTEE utilizes Arm Pointer Authentication (PA) to bind each request to the corresponding CA's identity and then verifies the identity when the CA accesses sensitive data, thereby preventing malicious request forgery. In particular, MaTEE isolates sensitive data of different CAs without modifying existing CAs and TAs. Our evaluation demonstrates that MaTEE successfully defends against SGVs with a minimal runtime overhead (2.19%).}

	abstract = {Considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing distributed backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) systems. While significant progress has been made in enhancing the security of FL systems, our study reveals that there remains a false sense of security surrounding FL. We demonstrate that colluding malicious participants can effectively execute backdoor attacks during the FL training process, exhibiting high sparsity and stealthiness, which means they can evade common defense methods with only a few attack iterations. Our research highlights this vulnerability by proposing a Collusive Backdoor Attack named CoBA. CoBA is designed to enhance the sparsity and stealthiness of backdoor attacks by offering trigger tuning to facilitate learning of backdoor training data, controlling the bias of malicious local model updates, and applying the projected gradient descent technique. By conducting extensive empirical studies on 5 benchmark datasets, we make the following observations: 1) CoBA successfully circumvents 15 state-of-the-art defense methods for robust FL; 2) Compared to existing backdoor attacks, CoBA consistently achieves superior attack performance; and 3) CoBA can achieve persistent poisoning effects through significantly sparse attack iterations. These findings raise substantial concerns regarding the integrity of FL and underscore the urgent need for heightened vigilance in defending against such attacks.}

Presently, watchtower proposals mandate the implementer to provide collateral as a safeguard against its collusion with potential adversaries. However, this collateral substantially inflates the implementation costs, consequently leading to higher service fees for users. Furthermore, most watchtowers are typically operated by a third-party entity, creating a single point of failure. To ameliorate the status quo, we propose a novel approach where PCN nodes collaboratively implement a watchtower system named “SilenTower.” Our proposal is rooted in the fundamental principles of blockchain systems, emphasizing maintenance by a community with an honest majority. SilenTower’s security no longer relies on collateral but rather on the inherent difficulty of a large proportion of collusion. SilenTower also allows inaccessible participants and thus obtains robustness. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that participants’ optimal strategy is to remain accessible and faithfully adhere to the SilenTower protocol. Furthermore, we assess the practical performance of SilenTower through comprehensive benchmarking, and the results reveal that it introduces lightweight overheads.}

	abstract = {Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative learning paradigm where participants share the same sample space while splitting the feature space. In VFL, local participants host their bottom models for feature extraction and collaboratively train a classifier by exchanging intermediate results with the server owning the labels. Both local training data and bottom models contain privacy-sensitive information and are considered the intellectual property of each participant, and thus should be protected by the design of VFL. Our study exposes the fundamental susceptibility of VFL systems to privacy leaks, which arise from the collaboration between the server and clients during both training and testing. Based on our findings, we propose PISTE, a model-agnostic framework of privacy stealing attacks against VFL. PISTE delivers three privacy inference attacks, i.e., model stealing, data reconstruction, and property inference attacks on five benchmark datasets and four different model architectures. We further discuss four potential countermeasures. Experimental results show that all of them cannot prevent all three privacy stealing attacks in PISTE. In summary, our study demonstrates the inherent yet rarely uncovered vulnerability of VFL on leaking data and model privacy.}

	abstract = {Face authentication technology has been widely used in physical access control to critical infrastructures. The security of a face authentication system has been threatened by photo replay attacks and thus the 3D liveness detection techniques have been deployed to safeguard such systems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the security aspects pertaining to 3D liveness detection systems that employ structured light depth camera, and propose a novel attack surface targeting 3D face authentication systems involving multiple modalities such as Depth, RGB and IR. We propose the DepthFake attack, a multi-modal spoofing attack against real-world 3D face authentication using only a single 2D photo. To achieve it, DepthFake first reconstruct the depth information of the victim's face from his 2D photo. Then, DepthFake actively projects a carefully-crafted scatter patterns embedded with the face depth information, in order to empower the 2D photo with 3D authentication properties. We address a range of practical challenges, including mitigating depth estimation errors, achieving depth images forgery techniques based on structured light, ensuring accurate alignment between various modalities of face images, and effectively implementing DepthFake in real world. We validated DepthFake on 5 commercial face authentication systems (i.e., Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, 3DiVi, Ali Cloud and ArcSoft) and two commercial access control devices. The results over 50 users demonstrate that DepthFake achieves an overall Depth attack success rate of 79.4%, RGB-D attack success rate of 59.4%, IR-D attack success rate of 79.4%, and RGB-IR attack success rate of 83.8% in the real world.}

	abstract = {For communication within military avionic platforms (e.g., F-15 and F-35), the US Department of Defense established MIL-STD-1553 military standard. It has been released for more than 50 years and is still used in platforms other than military avionics. It was originally produced to be used with military avionics, but in the following decades, it was adopted into all branches of the armed forces, as well as spacecraft and commercial avionics. However, potential attacks against the MIL-STD-1553 may exist due to the demand for internet communication between planes and the lack of security. The current study presents PulseAnomaly, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection model for the MIL-STD-1553 bus that utilizes time-feature and message sequences. Our model demonstrates better performance compared to baseline models in the test, achieving a higher F1-score and showing excellent AUROC compared to existing methods. Additionally, we have used data from a recently developed open-source MIL-STD-1553 real-time bus simulator, which features a more diverse range of attacks and data points that more closely resemble real-world scenarios. Evaluation results show that our model outperforms existing unsupervised solutions.}

	abstract = {The vulnerabilities of deep learning models towards adversarial attacks have attracted increasing attention, especially when models are deployed in security-critical domains. Numerous defense methods, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for model robustness improvement. Reactive defenses, such as conducting transformations to remove perturbations, usually fail to handle large perturbations. The proactive defenses that involve retraining, suffer from the attack dependency and high computation cost. In this article, we consider defense methods from the general effect of adversarial attacks that take on neurons inside the model. We introduce the concept of neuron influence, which can quantitatively measure neurons’ contribution to correct classification. Then, we observe that almost all attacks fool the model by suppressing neurons with larger influence and enhancing those with smaller influence. Based on this, we propose Neuron-level Inverse Perturbation (NIP), a novel defense against general adversarial attacks. It calculates neuron influence from benign examples and then modifies input examples by generating inverse perturbations that can in turn strengthen neurons with larger influence and weaken those with smaller influence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and models show that NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of i) effective - it shows better defense success rate ( \\sim \\!\\!\\times 1.45 \\sim \\!\\!\\times 1.45 ) against 13 adversarial attacks; ii) elastic - it maintains better defense ( \\sim \\!\\!\\times 3.4 \\sim \\!\\!\\times 3.4  in the worst case) on large perturbations; iii) efficient - it runs with only  \\sim \\!\\!1/6 \\sim \\!\\!1/6  time cost; iv) extensible - it can be applied to speaker recognition models and Baidu online image platforms. We further evaluate NIP against potential adaptive attacks and provide interpretable analysis for its effectiveness.}

However, implementing an electronic voting system poses challenges, such as meeting the stringent security requirements for anonymity, fairness, and verifiability. Another concern is the performance degradation when dealing with a large number of voters. In this paper, we propose  S^{3} S^{3} Voting, a blockchain sharding-based e-voting scheme that addresses these challenges. By combining robust security and scalability,  S^{3} S^{3} Voting provides reliable technical support for conducting large-scale elections. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Homomorphic Time-Lock Puzzle (HTLP) and one-time ring signature, the system safeguards voters’ privacy and ballot confidentiality. The approach involves dividing voters and miners into smaller shards, and implementing shard managing mechanisms to ensure security and enhance system efficiency. Through thorough security analysis, we demonstrate that  S^{3} S^{3} Voting not only meets the fundamental security requirements of e-voting but also offers verifiability and strong robustness-essential elements for successful large-scale elections. Moreover, experimental results indicate that  S^{3} S^{3} Voting significantly reduces the computational burden on individual miners and minimizes system processing time compared to existing blockchain-based e-voting solutions.}

	abstract = {Ensuring fairness in incentive mechanisms for federated learning (FL) is essential to attracting high-quality clients and building a sustainable FL ecosystem. Most existing fairness-aware incentive mechanisms distribute rewards to FL clients by quantifying their contributions to the performance of the global model. Essentially, these mechanisms pursue contribution fairness, namely a constant contribution-reward ratio across FL clients, with an implicit assumption that clients would be satisfied with the contribution fairness. However, research in social psychology has confirmed that this assumption may not hold in many real-world scenarios. According to equity theory proposed by Adams, an individual’s assessment and perception of receiving fair treatment significantly depend on the input-outcome ratio, where outcome simply refers to the rewards, while input is far more complex because it involves a bunch of subtle factors such as enthusiasm, experience and tolerance as well as the estimated contributions. Inspired by Adams’ equity theory, in this work, we expand the notion of contribution fairness to input fairness and propose a new fairness-aware incentive mechanism named FairReward that distributes rewards under the joint consideration of self-reported inputs and computed contributions. FairReward employs a reputation mechanism to enhance the credibility of self-reported inputs and leverages blockchains to eliminate the need of a trusted FL server and monetarily incentivize/penalize clients. In addition, FairReward adopts techniques including distributed differential privacy and locality-sensitive hashing to address privacy and non-IID issues in FL. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive security and privacy analysis. Finally, we evaluate FairReward through extensive experiments. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FairReward is effective, scalable and attack-resistant, and provides the input fairness required.}

	abstract = {To combat the rapid spread of misinformation on social networks, automated misinformation detection systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have been developed. However, these tools are often proprietary and lack transparency, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, privacy concerns limit data sharing by data owners as well as by data-driven misinformation-detection services. Although data encryption techniques can help address privacy concerns in DNN inference, there is a challenge to the seamless integration of these techniques due to the encryption errors induced by cascaded encrypted operations, as well as a mismatch between the tools used for DNNs and cryptography. In this paper, we make two-fold contributions. First, we study the noise bounds of homomorphic encryption (HE) operations as error propagation in DNN layers and derive two properties that, if satisfied by the layer, will considerably reduce the output error. We identify that  L_{2} L_{2}  regularization and sigmoid activation satisfy these properties and validate our hypothesis, for instance, replacing ReLU with sigmoid reduced the output error by  10^{6}\\times 10^{6}\\times (best case) to  10\\times 10\\times (worst case). Second, we extend the Python encryption library TenSeal by enabling the automatic conversion of a TensorFlow DNN into an encryption-compatible DNN with a few lines of code. These contributions are significant as encryption-friendly DL architectures are sorely needed to close the gap between DL-in-research and DL-in-practice.}

However, this scheme imposed a significant computational overhead on clients due to the utilization of fully homomorphic encryption, and the plaintext size scaled linearly with function input size. In this work, we present MVOC, a more efficient UC-secure MVC protocol, that significantly reduces the amortized overhead for clients in both semi-honest and malicious settings, by delegating a larger portion of the computation to the server. We enable clients to verify the garbled circuit before entering the online phase, ensuring security against malicious clients without incurring heavy overhead of compiling a semi-honest protocol into a malicious one. We present the detailed proof and analyze the theoretical complexity of MVOC. Furthermore, we implement our protocol and evaluate the performance, and the results demonstrate that the computation and communication overheads during the input phase can be decreased by at least 95.55% and 87.17%, respectively.}

We propose an efficient method to securely evaluate deep standard convolutional neural networks based on residue number system variant of Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme in the manner of batch inference. In particular, we introduce a packing method called Channel-By-Channel Packing that maximizes the slot compactness and Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) capabilities in ciphertexts. We also propose a new method for homomorphic convolution evaluation called Channel-By-Channel Convolution, which minimizes the additional heavy operations during convolution layers. Simulation results show that our work has improvements in amortized runtime for inference, with a factor of 5.04 and 5.20 for ResNet-20 and ResNet-110, respectively, compared to the previous results. We note that our results almost simulate the original backbone models, with classification accuracy differing from the backbone within 0.02%p. Furthermore, we show that the client's rotation key size generated and transmitted can be reduced from 105.6 GB to 6.91 GB for ResNet models during an MLaaS scenario. Finally, we show that our method can be combined with previous methods, providing flexibility for selecting batch sizes for inference.}

	abstract = {The landscape of cyberattacks has transcended from mere hobbyist pursuits of cybercriminals to a lucrative business model, facilitating their sustenance. Concurrently, the cybercrime market has evolved into a complex ecosystem. Empowered by this environment, cybercriminal tactics have evolved from simple, isolated activities to intricate and coordinated cyberattacks. In this article, we reveal a new type of cyberattack paradigm termed Attack Exploiting Cyber-arms Industry (AECI), which, despite its potential for severe impact, requires less investment and entails fewer obstacles and risks compared to traditional methods. However, this type of attack is still neglected by security researchers and communities and this is the first work focusing on this type of attack. To elucidate AECI, we provide an overview of the cyber-arms industry and introduces an attack model. The model dissects each phase of AECI to illuminate its operational mechanics and strategic imperatives. Furthermore, to assess its potential impact, a mathematical model is proposed to estimate the scale of infection attributable to AECI. Through analysis of a specific attack case, our findings demonstrate that AECI can generate significant impacts within a brief timeframe, akin to the magnitude observed with the Mirai botnet. The proposed model is demonstrated to prove instrumental in effectively analyzing AECI and providing accurate estimations of its infection scale.}

	abstract = {This study presents a large-scale empirical analysis of real-life Internet-of-Things (IoT) malware by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 160,000 malicious executables detected by specialized IoT honeypots over five years. Our findings contribute to improving the knowledge of IoT malware characteristics and inter-relationships, which in return, contribute towards strengthening cybersecurity measures for IoT threat detection/mitigation. To achieve these goals, we leverage various malware analysis techniques to extract useful information from the executable files. Our analysis demonstrate that in contrast to non-IoT malware, we were able to extract unsolicited IP addresses and command strings from the majority of the analyzed IoT malware binaries using off-the-shelf de-obfuscation techniques/tools. Additionally, by correlating the extracted information and performing consequent similarity analysis using NLP-based features, we were able to reveal closely related samples with shared implementation across the adversarial infrastructure. Thus, contributing to labeling previously unseen/unknown IoT malware samples while uncovering emerging, possibly new variants. Finally, given such findings, we discuss the applications of a real-time IoT honeypot, which enables capturing real-time commands from malware-infected IoT devices while enabling timely and effective IoT-malware detection, analysis, labeling, and mitigation.}

	abstract = {Deep learning models have become ubiquitous in myriad application areas due to their remarkable performance. This success would not be possible without the high-quality datasets for model training that are contributed by numerous data owners. Datasets have not only become valuable assets for data owners, but also contain sensitive information that raises concerns about privacy leakage. This gives rise to urgent needs for data owners to verify that model developers have stopped using their datasets immediately upon receiving data deletion requests, as mandated by the right to be forgotten regulation. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing DuplexGuard: a novel framework for deletion right verification via a duplex watermarking approach. During watermark injection, for each owner's dataset, DuplexGuard generates duplex subsets of watermarked samples, i.e., the ambush subset and the surfacing subset. This duplex design is capable of offering a combination of watermark behaviors before and after data deletion, therefore allowing it to signify all potential dataset usage statuses. DuplexGuard also proposes a new two-way handshake protocol for issuing data deletion requests to provide more robust and decisive verification for the deletion right. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DuplexGuard is effective and reliable in verification.}

	abstract = {Multicore embedded systems employ a big.LITTLE architecture to combine different cores into a single microcontroller (MCU). However, resources sharing among cores raises security challenges. Once LITTLE cores (which often receive external inputs) are compromised, the whole system will be affected. Existing hardware-assisted isolation approaches use privilege separation and code instrumentation to enforce memory isolation, which suffer from inefficiencies. This paper presents uBOX, a lightweight sandbox for multicore embedded systems. The goal of uBOX is to enforce memory isolation over untrusted software (on LITTLE cores) at the same privileged level. Specifically, it uses the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to restrict memory access by untrusted software. To protect sandbox policies, uBOX deprives the write capability of untrusted software towards MPU configurations by replacing its regular store instructions with unprivileged counterparts. Additionally, to protect uBOX's necessary regular store instructions from being abused, uBOX's memory is set to read-only and non-executable when running untrusted software. For the normal operation of uBOX, we use an overlooked feature of the MPU and develop secure gates that quickly disable and re-enable the MPU, allowing uBOX to execute at a permissive memory view. Our evaluation demonstrates that uBOX effectively enforces isolation with average 1.27% runtime overhead, 0.83X Flash overhead, and 36.50X SRAM overhead.}

	abstract = {Signature-based malware detection methods are recognized for their simplicity, explainability, and efficiency. One of the most commonly used tools is Yara, which provides the syntax for crafting malware signatures. However, while developing high-quality Yara rules requires significant expertise in malware analysis, training such skilled analysts can be both resource-intensive and time-consuming. While a few works have been conducted to automate the generation of signatures, signatures generated by those works typically underperform the manually generated ones. In addition, these automated methods often depend on large static databases of hard-coded byte n-grams to minimize false positives. Instead of storing a large non-inclusive database to score byte n-grams, we propose a novel architecture utilizing two learning to rank neural networks to understand the underlying effectiveness and correlations among n-grams extracted for rule construction. This approach provides better flexibility and coverage of possible n-grams while reducing the required storage size from several GBs to only 10MBs. Combining these two models with a hierarchical density-based clustering method allows us to group multiple n-grams into logical conditions as Yara rules of higher quality. Experimental results show that our framework, NeuroYara, reduces the resources invested by analysts while generating rules with a low false-positive rate outperforming existing tools and manually-generated rules.}

However, applying LDP to top- k k  estimation in set-valued data (e.g., identifying most frequent  k k  items) may yield poor results for small and sparse datasets due to high sensitivity and heavy perturbation. To address this, we propose an adaptive approach that frames the problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which the decision-maker selects actions based on information collected from previous rounds to maximize the total reward over time. Inspired by this, we present two adaptive sampling schemes based on MAB: ARBS for identifying top- k k  items and ARBSF for both top- k k  item discovery and frequency estimation on these items. Furthermore, to address the potential long delay of multi-round collection, we propose an optimization technique to reduce the time complexity. Both theoretical and empirical results show that our adaptive sampling schemes significantly outperform existing alternatives.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the training process of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), introducing hidden malicious functionality that can be activated by a specific input pattern. Existing defenses typically rely on the assumption of a significant difference between poisoned and clean samples. However, subtle differences in dynamic and low poisoning ratio attacks can conceal poisoning features, thereby evading defenses. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor defense approach called Artemis, which utilizes distribution shifts to eliminate the discrepancy between poisoned and benign samples in the feature space. Additionally, Artemis learns from domain-invariant features after the shift. To further enhance the purification of backdoors in DNNs, we incorporate soft knowledge distillation into Artemis to guide the alignment of features between the source dataset domain and the generated distribution-shift dataset domain. We extensively compare our proposed method with 5 state-of-the-art (SOTA) defensive techniques under 9 SOTA attacks on 4 datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. Our results show that our method, Artemis, can successfully purify dynamic and low poisoning ratio backdoor attacks and outperform existing defenses by a significant margin.

However, existing deepfake localization methods struggle with with real-world deepfake videos, which are often multi-face scenarios with only some parts manipulated. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a Multi-View Inconsistency Measurement (MVIM) network that simultaneously measures inconsistencies from noise and temporal view to detect and locate tampered regions. Specifically, considering the noise inconsistencies in multi-face scenarios where fake faces have inconsistent noise patterns compared to real faces and backgrounds, we design a Noise Inconsistency Measurement (Noise-IM) module that measures noise similarity among faces and between faces and backgrounds using a masked attention mechanism to identify suspected tampered regions in noise domain. Since facial jitter of tampered regions in deepfake videos is observed to be more intense than that of real regions, we design a Temporal Inconsistency Measurement (Temporal-IM) module which adopts self-attention mechanism and fine-grained bi-direction convolutions to capture tampering traces between frames in temporal domain. Inconsistency features obtained by the two modules are fused for detecting and locating tampered regions. The superiority of our MVIM network is verified by extensive experiments with many state-of-the-art methods in different benchmark datasets.}

	abstract = {A temporal bipartite graph is a graph model that incorporates time-related information into its edges, making it suitable for modeling real-world phenomena like disease outbreaks. However, this temporal information is often sensitive. To protect the privacy of graph data, researchers have explored various approaches to preserve privacy in graph queries, with reachability queries being popular and fundamental as they determine the possibility of reaching one node from others in a graph. While privacy-preserving reachability queries have been extensively studied, existing efforts often overlook the valuable attribute information present in both edges and nodes of the graphs. Moreover, reachability queries on temporal bipartite graphs have not received sufficient attention in the literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to achieve various private reachability queries on structured encrypted temporal bipartite graphs ( \\mathsf{RQ} \\mathsf{RQ} - \\mathsf{STBG} \\mathsf{STBG} ) through a real-world scenario. Specifically, we construct a minimal index using hierarchical 2-hop labels and integrate structured encryption, order-revealing encryption, and garbled Bloom filters to support reachability queries with different label constraints. The proposed scheme is flexible and can cater to the query requirements of diverse users. Security analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves both preferable security and efficiency.}

Existing defenses often exhibit weaknesses when facing various attack algorithms and adaptive attacks or compromise accuracy for enhanced security. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel and highly efficient non-deep-learning-based image filter called the Iterative Window Mean Filter (IWMF) and proposed a new framework for adversarial purification, named IWMF-Diff, which integrates IWMF and denoising diffusion models. These methods can function as pre-processing modules to eliminate adversarial perturbations without necessitating further modifications or retraining of the target system. We demonstrate that our proposed methodologies fulfill four critical requirements: preserved accuracy, improved security, generalizability to various threats in different settings, and better resistance to adaptive attacks. This performance surpasses that of the state-of-the-art adversarial purification method, DiffPure. Our code is released at https://github.com/azrealwang/iwmfdiff.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed Machine Learning (ML) technique. Hierarchical FL is a novel variant of FL applicable to networks with multiple layers. Instead of transmitting client models to the server, hierarchical FL performs aggregations in the layers between the devices and the server. This further reduces the traffic toward the higher layers, which helps efficient link utilization. An adversary can manipulate a set of clients and send malicious model updates toward upper layers to create a trained model with a malicious objective. These attacks, also known as poisoning attacks, disrupt the model training. Like FL, Hierarchical FL is also vulnerable to poisoning attacks since the aggregators do not possess raw data. The existing robust algorithms are designed for FL systems with  n n n  clients and a server. Therefore, they are not effective against poisoning attacks in hierarchical FL systems. This paper proposes SHIELD, a novel robust aggregation technique that defends hierarchical FL systems from poisoning attacks. We evaluate SHIELD with several datasets in different application areas with different attack strategies and data distributions. The evaluation results demonstrate that SHIELD effectively defends hierarchical FL systems from poisoning attacks with a negligible impact on the benign performance of the models.}

	abstract = {Crowdsensing has become a popular method of sensing data collection while facing the problem of protecting participants’ location privacy. Existing location-privacy crowdsensing mechanisms focus on static tasks and participants without considering sensing tasks’ time requirements and participants’ mobility, which cannot achieve satisfactory collected data quality and task completion in crowdsensing with dynamic tasks and participants. Inspired by this, we proposed a location-preservation crowdsensing mechanism, FedSense, considering dynamic tasks and participants based on federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In FedSense, through RL's outstanding decision-making ability, participants select sensing tasks to perform by well-trained RL models without uploading location information to servers for task allocation. We propose an independent tasks selection environment that defines actions, states, and rewards of RL to enable FedSense to achieve satisfactory task completion and data quality while preserving location privacy. Besides, FedSense applies an asynchronous FL aggregation algorithm that reduces participants’ network stabilization and device computing ability requirements. Analysis proves that participants’ location information does not leave the local device during the model training and task selection process, effectively avoiding privacy leakage. Simulation shows that compared with existing location-preservation crowdsensing mechanisms, FedSense achieves the highest task completion and sensing accuracy for dynamic tasks and participants.}

	abstract = {Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is a technique that enables secure outsourcing of data to an untrusted cloud server without sacrificing search functionality. Recently, multi-user SSE schemes for data sharing, which support access control from various users, have gained attention. However, the access control mechanisms in existing schemes are not adequate for realistic data-sharing scenarios as they do not consider time constraints or only partially address them, making these mechanisms unsuitable for SSE schemes. To address this issue, we first highlight the importance of time constraints in multi-user SSE and propose a completely time-constrained SSE scheme under a two-server model. By taking advantage of the Lagrange interpolation and pre-computation, our proposed scheme enables searching over time-related encrypted data with owner-enforced time constraints. Additionally, we employ the blinding technique with the assistance of a semi-honest time server to ensure the completeness of time constraints, which is not guaranteed in existing works. Based on the leakage function, we prove the security of our proposed scheme in the simulation-based security model. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality of our scheme in supporting time-constrained functions.}

	abstract = {Behavioral biometrics-based continuous authentication has proven to be an excellent supplement to one-time authentication schemes that applies behavioral biometrics to authenticate smartphone users’ identities throughout the session. However, it still has two key issues that need to be addressed: 1) Due to behavioral biometrics from attackers are not available a priori, continuous authentication models should be trained only with normal samples in an unsupervised manner rather than treated as binary or multi-class classification tasks; 2) Differences in behavioral biometrics between attackers and legitimate users are fine-grained, it is challenging to extract rich semantic information to model users’ behavioral patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a lightweight latent representation masked one-class autoencoder, which is trained only with legitimate users’ behavioral biometrics. It consists of two parts: masked latent representation generator (MLRG) and Reconstructor. First, we apply the MLRG to generate discriminative latent representation with low dimension and then as a mask to cover important parts of the latent representation generated from the Reconstructor. Second, we apply the Reconstructor to reconstruct input based on masked latent representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior authentication performance of 0.68% EER, 0.94% EER, 2.14% EER, and 1.87% EER on four datasets, respectively.}

	abstract = {The widespread smart devices raise people’s concerns of being eavesdropped on. To enhance voice privacy, recent studies exploit the nonlinearity in microphone to jam audio recorders with inaudible ultrasound. However, existing solutions solely rely on energetic masking. Their simple-form noise leads to several problems, such as high energy requirements and being easily removed by speech enhancement techniques. Besides, most of these solutions do not support authorized recording, which restricts their usage scenarios. In this paper, we design an efficient yet robust system that can jam microphones while preserving authorized recording. Specifically, we propose a novel phoneme-based noise with the idea of informational masking, which can distract both machines and humans and is resistant to denoising techniques. Besides, we optimize the noise transmission strategy for broader coverage and implement a hardware prototype of our system. Experimental results show that our system can reduce the recognition accuracy of recordings to below 50% under all tested speech recognition systems, which is much better than existing solutions.}

	abstract = {In mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has garnered substantial attention as a distributed machine learning framework with significant advantages for protecting user privacy. Due to the limited resources of wireless bandwidth, such FL-based applications are quite susceptible to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Prior solutions either rely on centralized mechanisms that require complete information about all participants or are customized to specific systems. However, these solutions are either obsolete or ineffective given the new properties of FL. In this work, we first formulate a DDoS mitigation problem on bandwidth allocation for FL within mobile edge networks. Considering interactions between various network components and users, we propose an Evolutionary Game and Double-sided Auction-based framework, termed EGDA, which consists of EG-based and DA-based mechanisms for user-bandwidth allocation (UBA) and server-bandwidth allocation (SBA), respectively. Specifically, to address DDoS attacks on UBA, we design an EG-based approach with minimum latency for FL under limited information. The proposed EG-based allocation algorithm is proven to be stable and achieve the evolutionary equilibrium. To mitigate DDoS attacks on SBA, we study an approach of DA with social welfare maximization while protecting the privacy of participants. Then, an iterative DA-based allocation algorithm is developed to be convergent and satisfy desirable economic properties. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that EGDA mitigates DDoS attacks effectively and efficiently.}

	abstract = {Accountable anonymous credentials protect user privacy while holding the accountability of ill-intentioned individuals, which is a critical feature for applications such as online payments and other financial services. Existing accountable anonymous credentials rely on a public committee of trustworthy members who are assumed not to collude and are well protected to perform privacy revocation. However, this assumption is unsound in blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems because the selected committees may involve nodes with significant stakes, and public nodes serving as committee members are vulnerable against targeted attacks from high-computing power adversaries. In this paper, we propose an improved accountable anonymous credential called AccCred, allowing users and issuers to randomly select a hidden committee within a set of authenticated candidates for privacy revocation. No one except the members with corresponding private keys knows their identity, preventing proactive attacks. As a core component, we introduce the primitive of dynamic triple-hiding committees (DTHC), which achieves authentication, dynamic join/delete, random selection, and strong anonymity of committee members. As a building block of DTHC, we design a shuffle protocol to provide efficient shuffle proof of randomized public keys. We formally prove our scheme and compare its performance with previous work for demonstration of practicality.}

However, cloud file systems have become prime targets for adversaries, and traditional designs are not equipped to protect organizations against the myriad of attacks that may be initiated by a malicious cloud provider, co-tenant, or end-client. Recently proposed designs leveraging cryptographic techniques and trusted execution environments (TEEs) still force organizations to make undesirable trade-offs, consequently leading to either security, functional, or performance limitations. In this paper, we introduce BFS, a cloud file system that leverages the security capabilities provided by TEEs to bootstrap new security protocols that deliver strong security guarantees, high-performance, and a transparent POSIX-like interface to clients. BFS delivers stronger security guarantees and up to a  2.5\\times 2.5\\times  speedup over a state-of-the-art secure file system. Moreover, compared to the industry standard NFS, BFS achieves up to  2.2\\times 2.2\\times  speedups across micro-benchmarks and incurs  < 1\\times < 1\\times  overhead for most macro-benchmark workloads. BFS demonstrates a holistic cloud file system design that does not sacrifice an organizations’ security yet can embrace all of the functional and performance advantages of outsourcing.}

Camenisch and Groß pioneered such statements with an Strong RSA-based ABC system on a restricted message space that offers efficient  \\mathsf{AND} \\mathsf{AND} ,  \\mathsf{OR} \\mathsf{OR}  and  \\mathsf{NOT} \\mathsf{NOT}  proofs. While other ABC frameworks have adopted constructions in the same vein, the Camenisch-Groß ABC has been the most expressive and asymptotically most efficient proof system to date. Due to its use of prime numbers as message space, however, it is constrained by the requirement of a trusted message-space setup and an inherent restriction to pre-defined finite-set attributes. In this paper, we present a provably secure ABC system that supports show proofs for complex logical statements on an unrestricted message space. Our construction is founded on the commit-and-sign paradigm and offers a novel commitment scheme. This construction is not only more expressive than existing approaches, but also highly efficient. Its ECC protocols only require a constant number of bilinear pairings by the verifier; none by the prover. As the security models for the existing approaches do not capture the expressiveness of this scheme, we introduce strong security models for impersonation resilience and unlinkability under adaptive active and concurrent attacks. Based on the  q q -(co-)SDH assumption, we prove the scheme's security with respect to both properties with tight reductions.}

However, safety and security were studied and discussed separately in previous studies. Meanwhile, there are some conflicts between safety and security in ICS, making the integration challenging to balance. In this paper, we put forward a scheme to incorporate safety and security in ICS utilizing fault trees and attack defense trees. We present a fault-attack defense tree model to evaluate safety and security. To solve the quantitative analysis issue, we adopted the fuzzy set theory and applied least squares to strengthen the confidence in the assessment outcomes. When conducting an integrated security and assurance assessment, our solution provides effective security countermeasures. In this paper, we prove that the suggested scheme can balance safety and security and properly assess the effectiveness of security countermeasures through experiments and analysis of the Tennessee Eastman system.}

	abstract = {Decentralized finance based on blockchain has experienced rapid development. To safeguard the privacy of participants, decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) systems such as ZCash and Zether have emerged. These systems employ cryptographic techniques to conceal the trader addresses and payment amounts. However, this anonymity presents challenges in terms of regulation. To address this issue, we propose the Walsh-DAP (WDAP) scheme, an efficient and generic regulation scheme for decentralized anonymous payments that strikes a balance between regulation and privacy preservation. Our scheme introduces two regulation policies: first, users who have exceeded their spending limits within a certain period will be identified during the regulation process; second, the supervisor possesses the capability to trace any anonymous transaction. To implement regulation effectively, we have designed an innovative commitment scheme, Walsh commitment, which leverages the orthogonal properties of Walsh codes to achieve the features of aggregatability and extractability. The supervisor in WDAP only needs to deal with the aggregation result of the Walsh commitments instead of the huge amount of raw transactions information, which greatly increases the efficiency. In a DAP system with 256 users, 10 transactions per second and 30 days as a regulation period, we reduced the communication cost for regulation from 14 GB to 94.20 KB, and the computing cost from  \\text{1.6}\\times \\text{10}^{\\text{5}} \\text{1.6}\\times \\text{10}^{\\text{5}}  s to 2.17s. Both improvement is of over five orders of magnitude. We formally discussed the security of the whole system, and verified its feasibility and practicability in the ZCash system.}

	abstract = {Encrypted deduplication is attractive for outsourced storage as it provides both data confidentiality and storage savings. Conventional encrypted deduplication schemes protect data confidentiality based on expensive cryptographic primitives, leading to performance degradation. Recently, several SGX-based schemes have been proposed to accelerate encrypted deduplication. However, these schemes have limitations in both security and performance aspects. This paper presents a SGX-based basic scheme to address these limitations, which first performs proof of ownership (PoW), followed by key generation and data encryption, realizing a new paradigm known as PoW-before-encryption (PbE) to solve the security issue in existing schemes. Additionally, the basic scheme implements deduplication-before-encryption (DbE) to reduce redundant computations, thus improving performance. Despite these improvements, the duplicate detection and key generation in the basic scheme still involve redundant computations. Consequently, we propose an epoch-based enhanced scheme that utilizes data locality and computation deduplication, which caches fresh computations in an epoch and reuses them to enhance performance. We provide a security analysis and evaluate the performance of our schemes using both synthetic and real-world workloads. The results demonstrate that our schemes offer stronger security guarantees while outperforming state-of-the-art schemes in terms of performance.}

	abstract = {Static Analysis Tools (SATs) show potential defect detection ability while their usability is severely hindered by massive unactionable warnings. To improve the usability of SATs, many machine learning-based Actionable Warning Identification (AWI) studies have been proposed, which mainly focus on mining warning features and improving identification models to identify actionable warnings. However, the underlying distribution of the warning dataset, which is closely related to feature mining and thereby affects AWI model performance, is not well-explored by these studies. Further, there is a lack of a well-prepared warning dataset to support the distribution analysis. In this article, we first propose a warning dataset construction approach, which incorporates manual inspection and verification latency into postprocess labels from an advanced closed-warning heuristic and thereby acquire credible labels. Based on 10 large-scale and real-world projects with 25K+ revisions and 2087K+ SpotBugs warnings, we construct a qualified warning dataset with 11975 distinct warnings. Subsequently, we thoroughly analyze the actionable warning distribution within projects against our constructed dataset from six warning characteristics (i.e., category, type, priority, rank, file, and method). Based on the analysis results, we present 16 findings. Finally, a preliminary study demonstrates that our findings can be practical and instructive in improving the usability of SATs.}

	abstract = {Federated Unlearning (FU) is gaining prominence for its capability to eliminate influences of specific users’ data from trained global Federated Learning (FL) models. A straightforward FU method involves removing the unlearned user-specified data and subsequently obtaining a new global FL model from scratch with all remaining user data, a process that unfortunately leads to considerable overhead. To enhance unlearning efficiency, a widely adopted strategy employs clustering, dividing FL users into clusters, with each cluster maintaining its own FL model. The final inference is then determined by aggregating the majority vote from the inferences of these sub-models. This method confines unlearning processes to individual clusters for removing the training data of a particular user, thereby enhancing unlearning efficiency by eliminating the need for participation from all remaining user data. However, current clustering-based FU schemes mainly concentrate on refining clustering to boost unlearning efficiency but without addressing the issue of the potential information leakage from FL users’ gradients, a privacy concern that has been extensively studied. Typically, integrating secure aggregation (SecAgg) schemes within each cluster can facilitate a privacy-preserving FU. Nevertheless, crafting a clustering methodology that seamlessly incorporates SecAgg schemes is challenging, particularly in scenarios involving adversarial users and dynamic users. In this connection, we systematically explore the integration of SecAgg protocols within the most widely used federated unlearning scheme, which is based on clustering, to establish a privacy-preserving FU framework, aimed at ensuring privacy while effectively managing dynamic user participation. Comprehensive theoretical assessments and experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves comparable unlearning effectiveness, alongside offering improved privacy protection and resilience in the face of varying user participation.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based malware detectors have shown promise in swiftly detecting unseen malware without expensive dynamic malware behavior analysis. These detectors have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial malware variants generated from meticulously modifying known malware to mislead detectors into recognizing them as benign. Being able to automatically generate optimized functional adversarial malware variants by defenders is crucial to effective cyber defense and staying ahead of the adversary. Current adversarial malware example generation methods often assume threat models with any of the following four restrictions: (1) requiring access to insider knowledge about malware detectors, (2) an unlimited size of adversarial modifications, (3) an unlimited number of queries to malware detector, and (4) relying on dynamic analysis of malware behavior in a sandbox. Drawing on Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL), we propose a novel closed-box binary manipulation method for adversarial malware optimization, named Actor-Critic with Contextualized Action Representations (AC-CAR), to generate malware variants without these restrictions. AC-CAR leverages two novel components, a contextualized policy and a neural language model-based RL-augmented top- k k k  sampling method. Unlike current methods, AC-CAR can utilize tens of thousands of actions to augment malware executables for evading DL-based malware detectors. AC-CAR yields an approximately 2-fold performance increase over the current methods on average, while decreasing the payload size to 20 times smaller than leading methods. We show that using the malware variants generated by AC-CAR in an adversarial re-training procedure improves malware detector’ robustness against adversarial variants by 29.65% on average.}

	abstract = {While techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) have been leveraged to secure outsourced electronic health record (EHR) computation, there are a number of known limitations (e.g., performance bottlenecks, lack of desired functionalities, or the reliance on a trusted third party). To address these challenging issues, this paper proposes MuEOC, an SGX-based multi-key homomorphic outsourcing computation scheme without a trusted third party. MuEOC is designed to support arbitrary depth multiplication and multi-key setup. In our approach, we first propose an SGX-assisted fully homomorphic encryption scheme (XFHE) under the randomized AGCD assumption. This allows us to replace costly bootstrapping with re-encryption in the enclave, and enable key-switching and Galois automorphism. Using XFHE as a building block, we construct a high-performance multi-key outsourcing computing protocol without the trusted third-party setup. Leveraging SGX, the MuEOC incorporates efficient sub-protocols of secure ciphertext transformation, secure polynomial evaluation, secure inner product, and secure non-linear function evaluation. We also present formal security proof which shows that our proposal guarantees the privacy of input EHR data and medical analysis results under the semi-honest model. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the outstanding efficiency of MuEOC.}

	abstract = {Advertising campaigns are crucial in business development, but most marketing techniques target online purchases (e.g., Google Adsense) and rely on a centralized architecture to store and process the campaign's data and check its effectiveness. Recently, proximity marketing has become more popular thanks to the widespread use of smartphones. It exploits the short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth) between smartphones and beacon devices to collect and send marketing information to customers. However, this might create privacy issues for customers due to the potential leakage of sensitive information (such as locations associated with time). In this paper, we propose ProMark, a privacy-aware blockchain-based platform to verify the effectiveness of proximity marketing campaigns by ensuring transparency, decentralization, and privacy in the measurement process. We implemented ProMark and carried out experiments that show that ProMark can be used in super-regional malls even during peak hours.}

	abstract = {As one of the most popular blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts, Ethereum has caught the interest of both investors and criminals. Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to its pseudonymous nature. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. Experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset demonstrate that proposed RiskProp newly discovered 63% of the Top 150 high-risk accounts as suspicious. The superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method (85.63% accuracy).}

	abstract = {Fueled by its successful commercialization, the recommender system (RS) has gained widespread attention. However, as the training data fed into the RS models are often highly sensitive, it ultimately leads to severe privacy concerns, especially when data are shared among different platforms. In this paper, we follow the tune of existing works to investigate the problem of secure sparse matrix multiplication for cross-platform RSs. Two fundamental and critical issues are addressed: preserving the training data privacy and breaking the data silo problem. Specifically, we propose two concrete constructions with significantly boosted efficiency. They are designed for the sparse location insensitive case and location sensitive case, respectively. State-of-the-art cryptography building blocks including homomorphic encryption (HE) and private information retrieval (PIR) are fused into our protocols with non-trivial optimizations. As a result, our schemes can enjoy the HE acceleration technique without privacy trade-offs. We give formal security proofs for the proposed schemes and conduct extensive experiments on both real and large-scale simulated datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art works, our two schemes compress the running time roughly by  10\\times 10\\times  and  2.8\\times 2.8\\times . They also attain up to  15\\times 15\\times  and  2.3\\times 2.3\\times  communication reduction without accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification plays a crucial role in network management and cyberspace security. As the Internet evolves with new applications and protocols, traditional machine learning-based methods relying on feature mining have become obsolete. Instead, deep learning-based methods are becoming more popular in the field of traffic classification due to their end-to-end processing approach. However, the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial examples significantly compromises their performance. In this paper, we propose Robust Byte-Label Joint Attention Network (RBLJAN), an efficient and robust deep learning-based framework for encrypted network traffic classification at both the packet-level and the flow-level. RBLJAN comprises a classifier and an adversarial traffic generator. The classifier utilizes mechanisms such as header-payload parallel processing and byte-label joint attention learning to capture implicit correlations between bytes and labels, enabling the construction of powerful packet representations. The generator produces adversarial examples that are fed to the classifier to enhance its robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RBLJAN achieves over 99% average F1-score on real-world legitimate traffic datasets and achieves 97.86% average F1-score on malware identification. Moreover, RBLJAN exhibits superior performance in terms of detection speed and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods in real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Energy Harvesting Systems (EHSs) frequently suffer power failures and are particularly deployed in remote and open environments where physical access attacks on Non-volatile Memories (NVMs) are practical. However, prior crash consistency solutions for secure NVM were designed only for conventional power-rich systems with the assumption that enough power is steadily supplied. Moreover, the prior solutions rely on roll-forward recovery and cause a significant performance overhead in low-power EHSs. To achieve a low-cost and high-performance crash-consistent secure NVM working on low-power EHSs, this paper presents Milestone, the first efficient crash consistency solution that introduces a novel hybrid checkpoint mechanism to enable a rollback recovery for secure NVM working in frequent power failures.The hybrid checkpointing atomically (1) undo-logs data updates from program writes and (2) redo-logs the updates of security metadata associated with the data updates when an adaptive hardware timer expires. In particular, Milestone discovers an optimized eager update method for the security metadata that can be performed in parallel with the program writes to NVM by leveraging the rollback recovery. Our experimental results demonstrate that Milestone significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art roll-forward recovery-based solution for secure NVM running on low-power EHSs, achieving up to a 1.87x speedup, on average.}

	abstract = {Anonymous messaging system allows users to deliver messages without revealing the sending content and their identifiers, which has attracted ongoing concerns. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing solutions still fail to protect users’ privacy under coercion. That is, the user’s communication transcripts might be tracked and cached, and later coerced to reveal the underlying messages associated with the ciphertexts due to law enforcement reasons or for evil purposes. In addition, anonymity alone is not enough for some practical scenarios. For instance, a journalist just wants to communicate with those intended informants, and thereby gather information from anonymous but authenticated sources. In this paper, to address the above-mentioned issues, we introduce an authenticated and deniable anonymous messaging framework. Its core component is a new cryptographic primitive dubbed deniable identity-based matchmaking encryption (DIB-ME), which captures plausible deniability under coercion and mutual authentication without interactions simultaneously. We further present a concrete DIB-ME construction and prove its security in the random oracle model. The performance analysis indicates merits of the proposed DIB-ME scheme. We also implement the proposed DIB-ME construction and present extensive experiment results, as a proof of concept to demonstrate its soundness and practicability.}

	abstract = {Currently, the security of the control logic of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) is facing a serious threat, significantly impacting industrial production. Consequently, ensuring the security of PLC control logic becomes imperative. Formal verification emerges as a promising methodology for verifing PLC security through behavioral modeling and security testing. However, existing formal verification approaches primarily focus on modeling the PLC source code, overlooking the identification of compile-time errors and real-time runtime logic checks. Therefore, it is essential to apply formal verification to PLC control logic at the binary level. In this study, we introduce VoICS, a system designed to facilitate binary-level formal verification. Using reverse engineering, VoICS automatically parses PLC programs written by various programming languages at the binary level and constructs control flow graphs (CFGs). Furthermore, we use an algorithm combining two model optimization methods (i.e., trim invalid states and unnecessary states compression) to convert the reversed PLC assembly program into nuXmv format model. Lastly, VoICS establishes the corresponding constraints and performs formal verification on the model using nuXmv. The evaluation results demonstrate the capability of VoICS in identifying instances of unreliable control logic within PLC control programs, thus reinforcing the dependability of the industrial automation system.}

We propose a generic framework to build attribute-based access control encryption from ciphertext-policy ABE. Our instantiations prioritize different emphases on expressiveness and efficiency. The first instantiation supports multi-valued AND-gate access control structures, while the second supports the linear-secret-sharing access structure.

However, little attention has been paid to a systematic investigation of vulnerabilities in such systems. A common situation learned from the open source software community is that deep learning engineers frequently integrate off-the-shelf or open-source learning frameworks into their ecosystems. In this work, we specifically look into deep learning (DL) framework and perform the first systematic study of vulnerabilities in DL systems through a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and open-source DL tools, including TensorFlow, Caffe, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch. We propose a two-stream data analysis framework to explore vulnerability patterns from various databases. We investigate the unique DL frameworks and libraries development ecosystems that appear to be decentralized and fragmented. By revisiting the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) List, which provides the traditional software vulnerability related practices, we observed that it is more challenging to detect and fix the vulnerabilities throughout the DL systems lifecycle. Moreover, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,049 DL vulnerabilities to better understand the patterns of vulnerability and the challenges in fixing them.}

The hardware implementation of trace analysis minimizes the performanceimpact and achieves a very low error reporting latency (a few processor cycles). In this article, we evaluate the suitability of using HARVEST to detect errors resulting from transient physical faults. We explain how HARVEST is used to monitor a complex software component (Trampoline RTOS) on a commercially available hardware platform (Microchip SmartFusion2). We measure the overhead of the resulting instrumentation on system resources. We then evaluate its performance in detecting silent data corruptions, based on a systematic simulation of bit flips at the instruction set architecture level. We report a detection rate of up to 90.2% for a fairly low system resource overhead, suggesting an interesting trade-off for designers of highly constrained critical systems.}

	abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79% of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In comparison, only 1.7% of the full C-binaries succeed. When recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0% of the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries.}

	abstract = {The rapid digitization of aviation communication and its dependent critical operations demand secure protocols that address domain-specific security requirements within the unique functional constraints of the aviation industry. These secure protocols must provide sufficient security against current and possible future attackers, given the inherent nature of the aviation community, that is highly complex and averse to frequent upgrades as well as its high safety and cost considerations.

	abstract = {The threat posed by quantum computing has precipitated an urgent need for post-quantum cryptography. Recently, the post-quantum digital signature draft FIPS 204 has been published, delineating the details of the ML-DSA, which is derived from the CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Despite these advancements, server environments, especially those equipped with GPU devices necessitating high-throughput signing, remain entrenched in classical schemes. A conspicuous void exists in the realm of GPU implementation or server-specific designs for ML-DSA. In this paper, we propose the first server-oriented GPU design tailored for the ML-DSA signing procedure in high-throughput servers. We introduce several innovative theoretical optimizations to bolster performance, including depth-prior sparse ternary polynomial multiplication, the branch elimination method, and the rejection-prioritized checking order. Furthermore, exploiting server-oriented features, we propose a comprehensive GPU hardware design, augmented by a suite of GPU implementation optimizations to further amplify performance. Additionally, we present variants for sampling sparse polynomials, thereby streamlining our design. The deployment of our implementation on both server-grade and commercial GPUs demonstrates significant speedups, ranging from 284.9× to 485.3× against the CPU baseline, and an improvement of up to 60.9% compared to related work, affirming the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed GPU architecture for ML-DSA signing procedure.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the security management of packet filtering firewall policies got complicated due to the evolution of modern computer networks, characterized by growing size and heterogeneity of communications. The traditional manual approaches for configuring firewalls have become error-prone, unoptimized and time-consuming, leading to an increasing number of policy anomalies, including both sub-optimizations and conflicts. In literature, the techniques proposed for anomaly management have several shortcomings, as their anomaly analysis is usually excessively complex, while their anomaly resolution cannot solve all anomalies. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this article proposes a comprehensive approach for firewall policy anomaly analysis and resolution, based on the formal concept of atomic predicates. This approach has the aim to simplify the anomaly management operations, make them efficient and solve all configuration anomalies. The achievement of these objectives has been experimentally proved through the validation of a framework which implements the proposed approach, and whose time performance and anomaly management efficiency have been compared with the relevant alternative approaches.}

	abstract = {The e-vote is regarded as a way to express the opinion that the voters ask for. Actually, the e-vote could be applied wildly like questionnaire, survey and feedback. Moreover, the coexistences of efficiency and security as well as transparency and privacy could be considered as building blocks in the e-vote system. The blockchain could provide a public access board to reduce the storage costs for the field consisted of the vote group manager (GM) with its vote assistants (VA). Particularly the  k k -times anonymous authentication ( k k -TAA) could also be a practical approach to preserve voters’ privacy and reduce the computation costs during the vote process. However, the e-vote scheme with pure  k k -TAA strategy could damage either the supervision of voting or the efficiency and consistency of authentication process. What’s more, the impacts of dishonest voters couldn’t be stopped until the vote end. To tackle these problems, we apply the accumulator technology to add or revoke the voters at any time and extend the framework of  k k -TAA with the update process for the e-vote on blockchain for supervision (  k  k -TEVS). In our scheme, the voter updates his membership witness and proves the fact that he is still a valid member with respective VA under the latest accumulator value. What’s more, this witness update operation is not contained in the authentication process, which means that the authentication process is still constant and efficient. Moreover, our add or delete update process with signature of knowledge needs only one pairing operation. For the security, we prove that the relaxed anonymity still holds in the   k  k -TEVS framework. Finally, We implement   k  k -TEVS scheme, the Emura’s work [1] and the Huang’s work [2] for comparison. Then we make time cost and communication cost experiments, which present the feasibility and practicality of this scheme.}

	abstract = {Truth discovery is an effective technique for resolving data conflicts in crowdsensing. Fog-based mobile crowdsensing utilizes low-latency and high-efficiency communications capabilities of fog computing to achieve large-scale data sensing at a low cost. Privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the inclusion of users’ sensitive information in sensory data. However, existing PPTDs have not adequately addressed fog servers’ reliability and mobile devices’ efficiency simultaneously. Challenges are that fog servers are susceptible to breakdowns and collusion that causes privacy breaches, while mobile devices have limited resources. We thus propose a reliable and efficient PPTD for fog-based crowdsensing. We employ a threshold secret sharing scheme to establish secure multi-party computation primitives. These primitives are then used to construct an arithmetic circuit–an essential component of the PPTD. This approach preserves privacy of sensory data, as well as intermediate and final results, while accounting for server collusion, dropout, and mobile devices’ efficiency. It has  T T -out-of- N N  threshold reliability that resists ( T-1 T-1 ) servers’ collusion and ( N-T N-T ) servers’ dropout. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme reduces worker processing time by at least one order of magnitude and network communication overhead by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to existing PPTD methods.}

	abstract = {Content sharing, whether in Online Social Networks (OSNs) or even in the Internet of Things (IoT), serves as a pivotal link in the flow of data. To better protect the privacy of shared content, current OSNs allow sharers to manually set policies for uploaded content. However, this method of policy setting is not suitable for scenarios where IoT is deeply integrated with OSNs, as IoT devices often share content frequently and automatically. To address this issue, we propose the design, implementation, and evaluation of SmartCircles, a personalized photo-sharing and automatic deletion scheme. SmartCircles can function as a plugin within existing OSNs, supporting operations on various smart devices. It encompasses the following steps: a) Before sharing a photo, calculate the intimacy level depicted in the photo and the sharer's willingness to share. b) Before the recipient views the photo, calculate the intimacy between the sharer and the recipient, and evaluate feedback from the recipient. c) Based on the results computed above and a trade-off between profit and loss, recommend a recipient-aware automatic deletion control policy for the photo. We implement a prototype of SmartCircles, and the evaluation results demonstrate its effectiveness with an accuracy rate of policy recommendations reaching approximately 92%.}

	abstract = {Due to the economy and low power consumption features, bare-metal IoT devices have been widely used in various areas of our life, and they are usually paired with companion mobile apps to configure them and view their states (a.k.a., appified IoT system). The IoT systems have already become the lucrative and profitable targets for attackers because the compromised IoT devices will pose severe threats to IoT security and reliability. This problem become worse on bare-metal IoT devices since the tradeoff among price, functionality, performance, and energy efficiency usually results in insufficient security protection. Such bare-metal IoT devices usually adopt OTA (Over-The-Air) methods to update firmware, which is managed by the companion apps running on smartphones. Despite the prevalence of these appified IoT systems, there is a lack of systematic research on the security of bare-metal IoT device firmware update (DFU), although recent studies have reported security flaws in such systems. In this article, we propose a holistic approach to investigate DFU security of these appified IoT systems through collaborative analyzing the bare-metal firmware and the companion app. Additionally, we have developed an IoT system analysis framework named  B a r e D F U \\mathsf{BareDFU}  to automate the complex and time-consuming analysis tasks and facilitate the investigation. After applying  B a r e D F U \\mathsf{BareDFU}  to analyze 1,637 companion IoT apps, we found 710 of them contained security flaws spanning all three DFU stages: authentication, firmware acquisition, and firmware verification. Furthermore, we leveraged  B a r e D F U \\mathsf{BareDFU}  to investigate the bare-metal DFU security of six commercial appified IoT systems, and discovered they all had DFU flaws, which we successfully exploited to launch proof-of-concept firmware modification attacks. The affected vendors have acknowledged our findings and addressed the security flaws.}

We also evaluate the existing schemes regarding these properties and show they cannot achieve all properties altogether. Furthermore, we prove that there is a trade-off between the level of fairness that a watchtower provides to its clients and the coverage it can achieve. We also introduce FPPW, the first Fair and Privacy-Preserving Watchtower for Bitcoin. This new scheme provides fairness with respect to all channel participants including both channel parties and the watchtower. It means the funds of any honest channel participants are safe even assuming that the other two participants are corrupted and/or collude with each other. Furthermore, the watchtower in FPPW learns no information about the off-chain transactions and hence FPPW provides privacy against the watchtower. We also show that FPPW coverage, i.e., the total capacity of channels that an FPPW watchtower can cover, is higher than that of PISA and Cerberus and FPPW can be implemented without any update in the Bitcoin script.}

	abstract = {Private Function Encryption (PFE) enables two parties, one holding a private input $x$ and the other in possession of a private function $f$, to compute $f(x)$ in such that each party learns nothing substantial beyond $f(x)$. PFE is typically achieved by evaluating Yao's two-party computation protocol over a universal circuit that encodes the private function into a private input. Thus, the efficiency of the PFE protocol highly relies on the size of the underlying universal circuit. A universal circuit (UC) is a general-purpose circuit that can simulate arbitrary circuits (up to a certain size $n$). In 1976, Valiant provided a recursive construction of universal circuits and gave a theoretical construction of UC of asymptotic (multiplicative) size $4.75 n\\log n$ respectively, which matches the asymptotic lower bound $\\Omega (n\\log n)$ up to some constant factor. More recently, (Kiss et al. 2016) validated the practicality of universal circuits in real-world privacy-preserving applications. Subsequent work by (Günther et al. 2017) and (Alhassan et al. 2020) enhanced UCs’ practicality through hybrid constructions with various optimizations. This work focuses on optimizing the size efficiency of universal circuits. Our contributions are three-fold:  • Optimized component:  We first optimize the underlying component of Valiant's universal circuits to achieve an asymptotic size of $4.5 n\\log n$4.5nlogn. • More efficient framework:  We propose an improved framework for constructing universal circuits, under which we give a UC construction of asymptotic size $3n\\log n$3nlogn. This improves the previous state-of-the-art construction by 33%, which corresponds to the same fraction of reduction in the communication cost of UC-based PFE protocols. • Tigher lower bound:  To complement our constructive results, we show that the (multiplicative) size of the universal circuits is lower bounded by $2n\\log n$2nlogn.   We implement the 2-way universal circuits and evaluate their performance against other implementations, confirming our theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {Recent research in provably secure neural linguistic steganography has overlooked a crucial aspect: the sender must detokenize stegotexts to avoid raising suspicion from the eavesdropper. The segmentation ambiguity problem, which arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional decoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on these models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability distribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably secure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named SyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We group all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the steganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among ambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of the sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does not change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and thus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods. We provide theoretical proofs and experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our solution to various languages and models, showing its potential to significantly improve the reliability and security of neural linguistic steganography systems.}

	abstract = {Penetration testing (pentesting) assesses cybersecurity through simulated attacks, while the conventional manual-based method is costly, time-consuming, and personnel-constrained. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an agent-environment interaction learning paradigm, making it a promising way for autonomous pentesting. However, agents’ scalability in large action spaces and policy transferability across scenarios limit the applicability of RL-based autonomous pentesting. To address these challenges, we present a novel autonomous pentesting framework based on reinforcement learning (namely APRIL) to train agents that are scalable and transferable in large action spaces. In APRIL, we construct realistic, bounded, host-level state space via embedding techniques to avoid the complexities of dealing with unbounded network-level information. We employ semantic correlations between pentesting actions as prior knowledge to represent discrete action space into a continuous and semantically meaningful embedding space. Agents are then trained to reason over actions within the action embedding space, where two key methods are applied: an upper-confidence bound-based action refinement method to encourage efficient exploration, and a distance-aware loss to improve learning efficiency and generalization performance. We conduct experiments in simulated scenarios constructed based on virtualized vulnerable environments. The results demonstrate APRIL's scalability in large action spaces and its ability to facilitate policy transfer across diverse scenarios.}

	abstract = {Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) can provide a low-cost and reliable way for the message forwarding in urban areas, especially in which traffic jams occur frequently. However, in terms of the OppNet based on the bicycle-sharing system (BSS), how to predict bicycle trips and improve routing performance still remains unsolved. Moreover, the exchange of auxiliary information among OppNet nodes (bike stations) will compromise the privacy of nodes/users. Thus we design the Two-Tier Probability Model (TTPM), including the InteR-day pattern and the IntrA-day pattern, to predict the trips accurately. Then the Discrete Optimization Differential Privacy (DODP) method is utilized to disturb the estimated InteR-day and IntrA-day probabilities, which will further protect the privacy of nodes and users. With TTPM and DODP, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving routing scheme for OppNet, which transforms the relay selection problem into the shortest path problem approximately. Extensive simulations show that the proposed routing scheme (TTPM) outperforms the benchmarks with the delivery ratio of more than 0.75 when the time-to-live is 5 days and the message generation rate is 6 pkts/hour. Compared with TTPM+Lap and TTPM+GRR, the proposed TTPM+DODP improves the delivery ratio by 30% and 3%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Similarity search on encrypted data can identify similar data and handle misspelled keywords in a privacy-preserving manner and thus has received a lot of attention. However, existing schemes suffer from imprecise or predefined distance thresholds, which means that they do not always return the expected search results. Moreover, these schemes either do not consider document addition or lack forward security in this dynamic setting. In this article, we present a Similar Keyword Matching (SKM) framework that accurately calculates the Hamming distance between keywords through a new keyword representation called uni-pos-gram. Based on our framework, we propose a basic scheme for similarity search over encrypted data called SimSE that offers adjustable Hamming distance thresholds and an enhanced scheme called SimSE-F that provides forward security. Security analysis demonstrates that our schemes effectively safeguard the privacy of documents, indexes, and searches. Empirical experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and practical applicability of our schemes.}

	abstract = {Dynamic wireless power transfer provides a means for charging Electric Vehicles (EVs) while driving, avoiding stopping to charge and hence fostering their widespread adoption. Researchers have devoted much effort over the last decade to providing a reliable infrastructure for potential users to improve their comfort and time management. Due to the severe security and performance system requirements, the different schemes proposed in the last years lack a unified protocol involving the modern architecture model with merged authentication and billing processes. Furthermore, they require the continuous interaction of the trusted entity during the process, increasing the delay in communication and reducing security due to a large number of message exchanges. This article proposes a secure, computationally lightweight, unified protocol for fast authentication and billing that provides on-demand dynamic charging to deal with all the computational and security comprehensively with additional usability for the customers. The protocol employs an ID-based public encryption scheme to manage mutual authentication and pseudonyms to preserve the user's identity across multiple charging processes. Compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, our proposal provides on-demand service and public critical infrastructure security without impacting performances with around 7 ms, close to the most straightforward scheme available.}

	abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in industry, and their security and stability are very important. Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this article, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.}

	abstract = {Algorithmic fairness, emphasizing that machine learning algorithms should not discriminate against specific demographic groups, has recently gained increasing attention in the context of federated learning. Existing algorithmic fairness algorithms in federated learning primarily focus on mitigating inherent biases within the training data or biases introduced by non-IID data distributions. However, these methods heavily rely on the assumption of trust and cooperation among participants in federated learning, leaving a notable gap in exploring the robustness of algorithmic fairness under adversarial environments. Therefore, our study advocates the exploration of the robustness of algorithmic fairness in federated learning. We first introduce four types of fairness attacks targeting the fairness of federated learning models. Then, we propose FairGuard, an innovative defense framework designed to counter these attacks. FairGuard employs a novel dual-inference algorithm that effectively identifies malicious clients during the global aggregation phase of federated learning. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the introduced fairness attacks significantly compromise the global model's fairness and cannot be effectively mitigated by existing defense mechanisms, while FairGuard exhibits remarkable effectiveness in defending against these fairness attacks.}

	abstract = {In Web 3.0’s pursuit of a decentralized and user-autonomous network, traditional access control methods, such as central servers and weak decentralized algorithms, are insufficient regarding security, fault tolerance ability, and scalability. To solve this, we first design a decentralized multi-committee attribute-based encryption, X-ABE, to address the weak decentralization and low fault tolerance in Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE). X-ABE replaces MA-ABE’s fragile attribute authorities with robust attribute committees, each composed of multiple nodes. By developing dual-wrapped shares techniques, we address the increased dimensionality challenge of secret sharing while maintaining only 1 distributed key generation instance. Also, a formal security definition and proof under the partial adaptive model are given using dual system encryption. Second, X-LOCK, an X-ABE based decentralized access control utilizing consensus plus sharding, is proposed for Web 3.0, to achieve full decentralization, consistency, fault tolerance, user autonomy, and scalability. Third, X-ABE-R is proposed for attribute revocation and is demonstrated in X-LOCK-R with sharding blockchain as an immutable revocation ledger. Fourth, a formal definition and comparative analysis of X-ABE’s fault tolerance abilities are demonstrated, covering aspects of liveness and safety, along with the complexity analysis. Fifth, practical evaluations are conducted, demonstrating that while improving fault tolerance, the overhead remains acceptable.}

	abstract = {Machine unlearning has become a significant research topic on a global scale due to the increasing importance of privacy protection, particularly in light of the right to be forgotten legislation. Although many solutions are proposed, the current mainstream centralized machine unlearning studies are not feasible in federated learning (FL), where the server has no access to any users’ unlearning samples. In this paper, we aim to tackle the federated unlearning problem by proposing a Federated Unlearning (FedU) scheme via a user-side influence approximation forgetting method, thereby eliminating the need to share raw data with the server. In FedU, only users who have unlearning needs execute the influence approximation forgetting, while other users and the server just conduct the same operations as they did in FL. The proposed influence approximation forgetting method achieves unlearning by estimating the influence of the erased samples relying on only the user's local data and eliminating this influence from the model. However, the model utility is still negatively influenced by directly removing the influence estimation. To mitigate the side effects of unlearning, we propose a utility preservation method that simultaneously trains the unlearned model based on the unlearning requesters’ remaining local dataset. We design an adaptive optimization method to balance the forgetting and utility preservation effectiveness optimally during the unlearning process. Extensive evaluations on three representative public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, avoiding more than 3% accuracy degradation when the number of unlearning requesters is large.}

Based on the theories of statistical signal processing and composite hypothesis testing, a related theoretical framework is also developed for the analytical performance modeling of the new authentication protocol under both fixed and random beam pattern scenarios. Finally, we provide simulation and theoretical results to evaluate the reliability and security of the new authentication protocol against the identity-based spoofing attack.}

While studies suggest that only a small fraction of reported vulnerabilities are exploited, no follow-up research has investigated the reasons behind this. Our goal is to understand the factors contributing to the low exploitation rate to improve vulnerability detection and defense mechanisms. We collected 136,969 real-world smart contracts and analyzed them using seven vulnerability detectors. We applied Strauss’ grounded theory to gain insights into exploitability and analyzed transaction logs to trace the historic exploitations. Among the 4,364 smart contracts flagged as vulnerable, a significant 75.25% were found to be unexploitable, meaning they were either false positives or posed no security risk. We identified ten reasons for reporting unexploitable vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we found that only 66 out of 1,080 (6%) exploitable contracts had been exploited. We compared the characteristics of exploited versus non-exploited vulnerabilities and identified five factors that may reduce the likelihood of exploitation. Our findings highlight the importance of not treating smart contracts as conventional object-oriented (OO) applications. Researchers must account for the unique features of Solidity, smart contract design principles, and execution environments. Based on these insights, we propose six recommendations to improve smart contract vulnerability detection, prioritization, and mitigation.}

	abstract = {Recently, vision transformer based multimodal learning methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems. However, multimodal face data collected from the real world is often imperfect due to missing modalities from various imaging sensors. Recently, flexible-modal FAS (Yu et al. 2023) has attracted more attention, which aims to develop a unified multimodal FAS model using complete multimodal face data but is insensitive to test-time missing modalities. In this paper, we tackle one main challenge in flexible-modal FAS, i.e., when missing modality occurs either during training or testing in real-world situations. Inspired by the recent success of the prompt learning in language models, we propose Visual Prompt flexible-modal FAS (VP-FAS), which learns the modal-relevant prompts to adapt the frozen pre-trained foundation model to downstream flexible-modal FAS task. Specifically, both vanilla visual prompts and residual contextual prompts are plugged into multimodal transformers to handle general missing-modality cases, while only requiring less than 4% learnable parameters compared to training the entire model. Furthermore, missing-modality regularization is proposed to force models to learn consistent multimodal feature embeddings when missing partial modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our VP-FAS framework that improves the performance under various missing-modality cases while alleviating the requirement of heavy model re-training.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been shown vulnerable to a new class of adversarial attacks, known as model poisoning attacks (MPA), where one or more malicious clients try to poison the global model by sending carefully crafted local model updates to the central parameter server. Existing defenses that have been fixated on analyzing model parameters show limited effectiveness in detecting such malicious models. In this work, we propose FLARE, a robust model aggregation mechanism for FL, which is resilient against state-of-the-art MPAs. Instead of solely depending on model parameters, FLARE leverages the penultimate layer representations (PLRs) of the model for characterizing the adversarial influence on each local model update. We further propose a trust evaluation method that estimates a trust score for each model update based on pairwise PLR discrepancies among all model updates. Under the assumption of honest majority, FLARE assigns a low trust score to model updates that are far from the benign cluster. FLARE then aggregates the model updates weighted by their trust scores and finally updates the global model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE in defending FL against various MPAs, including semantic backdoor attacks, trojan backdoor attacks, and untargeted attacks, in various FL systems.}

In the preliminary version of this work (ESORICS 2022), we formally define the syntax and security models of Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet supporting Stealth Address (HDWSA), capturing the functionality and security requirements imposed by the practice in cryptocurrency. We propose a concrete HDWSA construction and prove its security in the random oracle model. Note that when applied in blockchain, in practice, signature aggregation could reduce the cost of computation, storage, and communication dramatically. In this full version, we develop HDWSA definition to further support signature aggregation (referred to as HDWSA ^{2} ^{2} ). In particular, we first formally define HDWSA ^{2} ^{2} , which, besides enjoying all the virtues of HDWSA on functionality and security, allows multiple signatures on different messages to be aggregated into one signature. We propose a concrete HDWSA ^{2} ^{2}  construction and prove its security in the random oracle model. We implement the HDWSA ^{2} ^{2}  construction and the experimental results show that verification of an aggregate signature is about 13 \\boldsymbol{\\times } \\boldsymbol{\\times }  faster than sequential verification of all the individual signatures. We can reduce the size of signatures in a single block by about 60% after aggregation.}

	abstract = {Navigation services enable users to find the shortest path from a starting point  S S  to a destination  D D , reducing time, gas, and traffic congestion. Still, navigation users risk the exposure of their sensitive location data. Our motivation arises from how users can accurately, securely, and efficiently navigate from  S S  to  D D  while passing through  k k  unordered stops, i.e., midway locations with a non-fixed visiting order. In this work, we formally define Semi-Constrained Navigation (SCN) and present a novel scheme Hermes to achieve accurate, secure, and efficient SCN. Specifically, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach to strike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. It recursively depth-first-searches the whole area (a navigation tree) and invokes five carefully-crafted strategies stop-by-stop to compute three subpaths in three sequential subareas. We construct a path-distance oracle to encrypt the road graph and securely implement the strategies by using homomorphic encryption and garble circuits. We formally prove the security in the random oracle model and analyze the search complexity to be less than  O(k^{2}) O(k^{2}) . We experiment over a real-world city map and compare with six baselines. Results show that path search with  k=4 k=4  among  N=1000 N=1000  intersections requires 5.58 seconds with a 3.2% distance deviation rate and an 82.5% path similarity.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has increasingly been deployed, in its vertical form, among organizations to facilitate secure collaborative training. In vertical FL (VFL), participants hold disjoint features of the same set of sample instances. The one with labels - the active party, initiates training and interacts with other participants - the passive parties. It remains largely unknown whether and how an active party can extract private feature data owned by passive parties, especially when training deep neural network (DNN) models. This work examines the feature security problem of DNN training in VFL. We consider a DNN model partitioned between active and passive parties, where the passive party holds a subset of the input layer with some features of binary values. Though proved to be NP-hard. we demonstrate that, unless the feature dimension is exceedingly large, it remains feasible, both theoretically and practically, to launch a reconstruction attack with an efficient search-based algorithm that prevails over current feature protection. We propose a novel feature protection scheme by perturbing intermediate results and fabricated input features, which effectively misleads reconstruction attacks towards pre-specified random values. The evaluation shows it sustains feature reconstruction attack in various VFL applications with negligible impact on model performance.}

	abstract = {Protocol Reverse Engineering (PRE) serves as the foundation for numerous security analysis techniques, such as vulnerability mining and intrusion detection, etc. The PRE analysis precision can directly affect the accuracy of these downstream techniques. The network-trace-based PRE technique has become the mainstream PRE technique attributed to its ease of implementation. However, without the prerequisite of additional dedicated devices or knowledge of information, the analysis precision of existing network-trace-based PRE methods is often achievable at only byte or half-byte level but not the fine-grained bit-level, which makes it increasingly challenging to meet the precision requirements of those downstream security applications. In this work, we propose a fine-grained PRE scheme, named FineBID, which makes the identification capability in a fine-grained manner for existing network-trace-based PRE methods into bit-level fields. FineBID follows the global characteristics of protocol fields and constructively models the bit-level field identification problem as a multi-objective decision model, which thus effectively overcomes the insufficient representativeness of bit-level fields’ local characteristics. Then, the multi-objective decision model is solved to obtain the Pareto solution set for different field segmentation levels, and the utility value per bit is further computed. The utility value can be used as the immediate indicator to determine whether each bit is a field boundary or not. Meanwhile, we propose an Actual Ground Truth that is more in line with the actual usage of each bit. With extensive experiments on the Internet, wireless, and industrial protocols, we affirm that FineBID can not only significantly reduce the search space for Ground Truth or Actual Ground Truth with a space reduction of 95.3% compared to exhaustive search, but also identify Ground Truth or Actual Ground Truth more accurately than other similar methods.}

In this paper, we propose Purifier to defend against membership inference attacks by quantifying the differences between dataset members and non-members in three dimensions: individual shape, statistical distribution, and prediction label. Purifier involves transforming the confidence scores produced by the target classifier, resulting in purified confidence scores that are indistinguishable across the dimensions above. We conduct experiments on widely-used datasets and models. The results show that Purifier offers robust defense against membership inference attacks with superior efficacy compared to prior defense techniques while maintaining minimal utility degradation (e.g., less than 0.7% classification accuracy drop of most datasets). Additionally, our extended experiments explore the effectiveness of Purifier in defending against the model inversion attack and the attribute inference attack.}

	abstract = {Addressing blockchain's insufficient throughput and scalability is imperative for practical viability. Off-chain approaches, such as state channels (including Hash Time Lock Contract (HTLC), virtual channels), demonstrate enhanced throughput by enabling parallel transaction processing. While virtual channels introduce execution complexity, HTLC suffers from high update delays. Moreover, existing methods face network attacks. We present Sharding-based Hybrid State Channel (SharHSC) to address these issues. First, we introduce a novel off-chain sharding architecture, which partitions proxy nodes into multiple shards. Thus, when the off-chain node count increases, adding shards enhances system throughput. Second, each shard establishes a supervisory committee to record latest channel statuses to ensure accurate fund distribution upon channel closure. Third, we combine the strengths of HTLC and virtual channels. In particular, SharHSC constructs a single virtual channel across all the nodes involved in the payment by treating the nodes between payer and payee as an intermediate entity, which utilizes HTLC for fund routing. This realizes both low latency and streamlined complexity. Finally, our work is substantiated by security analysis and experiments. As the node number varies, compared with HTLC and virtual channels, the latency is reduced by 49.32% and 31.82%, and the throughput is increased by 8.93 and 1.89 times.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a widely used method for collaborative machine learning without sharing local data. In this approach, participants train models using their local data, and the model updates are aggregated into a global model. However, ensuring trustworthy model training is crucial because malicious participants may not use their actual local data or may not train the model as intended, which makes it challenging to guarantee the authenticity of the data and the integrity of the model training. To address these issues, we propose a trustworthy model training scheme (TMT-FL) with verifiable authenticity and integrity. Specifically, we leverage zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) based proofs to verify the integrity of the training execution. To deal with the performance bottleneck in generating zk-SNARK proofs, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to optimize the convolution operation, and present an improved zk-SNARK based proof generating scheme which significantly reduces the online proving time. Besides, we adopt matrix commitment along with bloom filter to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the training datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our improved zk-SNARK scheme performs nearly  3.1\\times 3.1 × 3.1\\times  faster than the state-of-the-art in online proving time. Moreover, we experimentally confirm the efficiency of TMT-FL under diverse datasets in terms of computational costs, storage costs, and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {The adoption of symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) has become increasingly common. However, many current SSE schemes assume an honest-but-curious cloud service provider (CSP) or necessitate significant overhead to manage a malicious CSP. Furthermore, most of these schemes are tailored for static datasets. Our paper presents an efficient SSE scheme that aims to address these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme that supports dynamic datasets with forward and backward privacy, integrity verification of non-empty and empty search results, efficient search, non-interactive, light client, and both forward and inverted indexes simultaneously. In this paper, we present two novel approaches, Hexie and Jianding. Hexie implements secret sharing to conceal index entries, enabling dynamic updates, non-interactive interactions, and lightweight clients. To enhance the reliability of search results and address the problem of empty, incomplete, or inaccurate outcomes, we introduce the Jianding scheme as an extension of Hexie. It combines a chained MAC structure with a secret sharing scheme, which enables a client to verify the data integrity of the search result efficiently. Moreover, we propose graph-based dictionary sharding to enhance search efficiency. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Coverage-guided fuzzing is prevalent in detecting DBMS (Database Management System) bugs. However, current coverage-guided DBMS fuzzers suffer from two limitations that prevent fuzzers from discovering bugs efficiently. First, the coverage feedback is imprecise which prevents fuzzers from making optimal decisions on fuzzing strategies. Second, DBMS fuzzers lack testcase trimming to control the increasing input sizes. The large input size makes DBMS execution slower and reduces the likelihood that a mutation would touch important structures. In this paper, we proposed corresponding methods to overcome these limitations. Specifically, the work-task coverage tracking and unstable edge filtering improve the coverage accuracy with low instrumentation overhead. Based on more accurate coverage, we further propose testcase trimming to improve the speed of bug detection. We implemented a prototype named Tuzz and evaluated it on three popular DBMSs. The evaluation result shows that Tuzz explores 16.3%, 26.1%, and 26.6% more edges than the state-of-the-art fuzzer in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB, respectively. More importantly, Tuzz has discovered 10 and 4 previously unknown bugs in MySQL and MariaDB.}

	abstract = {To avoid the pixel modification traces left by steganography from being detected by passive steganalysis, and to prevent the hidden data from being destroyed by active steganalysis attacks, Coverless Image Steganography (CIS) that does not modify pixels has attracted widespread attention. However, most existing CIS methods are limited in their maximum capacity due to insufficient diversity in their hash sequences. In addition, these methods struggle to maintain high robustness against both geometric and non-geometric attacks simultaneously. To address these two issues, a new coverless image steganography method is proposed to enhance CIS methods’ applicability, security, and robustness in highly insecure networks. During the hiding process, hash sequences are generated by a SHA-256 algorithm that integrates inter-block and inter-channel fusion, providing higher diversity than other CIS methods. Consequently, the proposed CIS method achieves higher capacity on publicly available datasets. During the extraction process, an evaluation metric that combines visual and histogram similarity is designed to improve the accuracy of inverse image retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIS method achieves capacity increases of 26.73% and 38.34% over other CIS methods on the VOC and COCO datasets, respectively. Moreover, this method exhibits nearly 100% robustness against common active steganalysis.}

	abstract = {Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has been widely studied as an important semantic enhancement technique that extracts expressive representation from Knowledge Graph (KG) to facilitate various downstream applications, such as knowledge reasoning, Semantic Web, and question answering. The advent of Federated KGE (FKGE) allows for collaborative training across distributed KGs without revealing clients’ private raw KGs that contain sensitive knowledge graph triples. Despite this, FKGE remains susceptible to privacy threats as demonstrated in previously studied federated learning models. However, utilizing and addressing these vulnerabilities remain uninvestigated for FKGE which exhibits unique characteristics distinct from other models. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of the privacy issues in FKGE from both attack and defense perspectives. On the attack side, we introduce five new inference attacks, highlighting the privacy vulnerabilities by successfully deducing the presence of KG triples from the targeted dataset. On the defense side, we present PDP-Flames, a novel differentially private FKGE scheme that leverages the sparse gradient nature of FKGE for better privacy-utility trade-off by integrating advanced private selection techniques. We further introduce a dynamic defense policy based on the observation that the privacy risk fluctuates throughout the training procedure. Additionally, we incorporate a personalized procedure to provide a customized model tailored to the unique data distributions of individual clients. Joint differential privacy is introduced to guarantee the privacy of the personalized models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PDP-Flames effectively mitigates privacy concerns, notably diminishing the attack success rate while maintaining decent model utility.}

	abstract = {The sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are perceived as large-scale heterogeneous networks. With their increased heterogenization and densification, it is crucial to guarantee the security and efficiency of user equipment's handovers between networks. However, existing cross-domain handover authentication schemes cannot ensure handover authentication efficiency and cannot balance privacy and system efficiency, which thus cannot be directly applied in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we present PECHA, a privacy-preserving and efficient cross-domain handover authentication scheme for heterogeneous networks, which enables anonymous authentication on user equipment (UE) through the collision property of chameleon hash functions. PECHA ensures authentication efficiency by employing the interplanetary file system and blockchain to synchronize UE's authentication information to target networks in advance. The privacy and system efficiency are balanced by modeling the unlinkability of UE's new and old chameleon hash values and determining the update frequency of UE chameleon hash value. PECHA also achieves correctness, mutual authentication and key agreement, anonymity, unlinkability, conditional privacy, forward/backward secrecy, robustness, known randomness secrecy, key escrow freeness and rapid response, and resists against spoofing attacks, replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. Comprehensive performance analysis, evaluation and comparisons show that PECHA is efficient with respect to both computation and communication.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be susceptible to various malicious attacks, such as adversarial and backdoor attacks. However, most of these attacks utilize additive adversarial perturbations (or backdoor triggers) within an  L_{p} L p L_{p} -norm constraint. They can be easily defeated by image preprocessing strategies, such as image compression and image super-resolution. To address this limitation, instead of using additive adversarial perturbations (or backdoor triggers) in the pixel space, this work revisits the design of adversarial perturbations (or backdoor triggers) from the perspective of color space and conducts a comprehensive analysis. Specifically, we propose a color space backdoor attack and a color space adversarial attack where the color space shift is used as the trigger and perturbation. To find the optimal trigger or perturbation in the black-box scenario, we perform an iterative optimization process with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Experimental results confirm the robustness of the proposed color space attacks against image preprocessing defenses as well as other mainstream defense methods. In addition, we also design adaptive defense strategies and evaluate their effectiveness against color space attacks. Our work emphasizes the importance of the color space when developing malicious attacks against DNN and urges more research in this area.}

	abstract = {Deep Learning image forgery localization methods have achieved remarkable results but cannot maintain comparable performance when the forgery images are JPEG compressed, a format that is widely used in daily information transmission. The robustness against JPEG compression has become a bottleneck to the practical application of image forgery localization. To address this issue, a robust image forgery localization framework is proposed against the performance degradation caused by JPEG compression. Specifically, a cutting-edge progressive disentanglement strategy is proposed that incorporates coarse-grained image disentanglement to mitigate the detrimental effects of general JPEG compression, while harnessing the ability of fine-grained element disentanglement to separate multi-scale artifacts, thereby minimizing interference from content information. Moreover, the decision strategy is carefully designed to reinforce subtle signals from tampered areas, including artifacts fusion block reasoning multi-scale artifacts and dual attention block that learn more about forgery-related features. Extensive visualizations and experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive performance in general JPEG-resistant image forgery localization, especially in the performance of generalization experiments.}

	abstract = {The Low-Rate Denial of Service (LDoS) attack poses a significant threat to Internet services. Exploiting vulnerabilities in adaptive mechanisms embedded within network protocols, LDoS attacks are covert and exhibit legal behavior, making defense challenging. Existing LDoS attack solutions cannot perform real-time LDoS attack defense at line speed. With the emergence of P4, users can program the per-packet processing logic of the P4 switch, which offers us the chance to propose PLUTO, the first data plane-aware LDoS attack defense system built upon the P4 switch, possessing line-speed execution capacity. To meet the resource constraints of the P4 switch, we propose the time window-based pre-inference strategy to detect LDoS attacks and the time-limited per-flow state management to filter the LDoS attack flows. For the practical deployment, we develop the P4 Function Tool to extend the P4 primitives for more function operations. We also adopt an encoding-based mapping method to deploy the pre-inference model. Furthermore, we develop the async-updated hash table for quickly filtering LDoS attack flows. Compared with the baseline, PLUTO reduces the equal error rate (EER) by 27.96% and the average mitigation response time by 12.749 s, increasing the AUC by 1.83%, the F1 Score by 7.27%, and the Recall by 9.58%.}

	abstract = {The OpenRAN initiative promotes an open Radio Access Network (RAN) and offers operators fine-grained control over the radio stack. To that end, O-RAN introduces new components to the 5G ecosystem, such as the near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC) and the accompanying extensible Applications (xApps). The introduction of these entities expands the 5G threat surface. Furthermore, with the movement from proprietary hardware to virtual environments enabled by Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), attack vectors that exploit the existing NFV attack surface pose additional threats. To deal with these threats, we propose the xApp repository function (XRF) framework for scalable authentication, authorization, and discovery of xApps. To harden the XRF microservices, we isolate them using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). We benchmark the XRF modules individually and compare how different microservices behave in terms of computational overhead when deployed in virtual and hardware-based isolation sandboxes. Our evaluation shows that the XRF framework scales efficiently in a multi-threaded Kubernetes environment. The isolation of the XRF microservices introduces different amounts of processing overhead depending on the sandboxing strategy. Finally, a security analysis is conducted to show how the XRF framework addresses chosen key issues from the O-RAN and 5G standardization efforts.}

	abstract = {Recently, many sharding blockchain protocols have sacrificed some important attributes to improve scalability, and this makes them complicated and insecure. Moreover, achieving a constant (rather than linear) Communication Cost Per Transaction (CCPT) is still a challenge for many sharding protocols. Motivated by this, we present EZchain, a scalable blockchain protocol via “passive sharding” with proven validity and security. We redesign the Value-Centric Blockchains (VCB) framework to achieve the passive sharding that helps EZchain reach higher security than traditional sharding protocols. With fixed initialization parameters, the expected value of EZchain's communication cost reaches a constant level, and it is independent of the network's size. Moreover, the EZchain node's storage cost without beacon chains also approaches a constant and does not change with the increase in the network's size and transactions. Cross-shard transactions, network sharding algorithm, and anti-Sybil attack verification are no longer needed in passive sharding, thus EZchain is very concise and efficient. Our experiment uses a lightweight EZchain prototype and extends the experimental network size up to 100,000 nodes. The evaluation results show that EZchain satisfies all our analyses of its performance (the constant communication and non-beacon storage cost) in large networks. In addition, the comparison experiment shows that ezchain has obvious advantages over the previous protocols in long-term operation and large network environments.}

	abstract = {5G Proximity-based Service (ProSe) UE-to-Network (U2N) Relay can help a remote 5G User Equipment (UE) out of coverage connect with the network. The 3GPP committee has provided the standard Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocols to achieve secure access for a Remote UE and establish a secure link between a Remote UE and a U2N Relay. However, the security of these AKA protocols is a remaining issue. At first, we present two detailed 5G ProSe AKA protocols over Control Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP) for U2N Relay communication referring to multiple related standards, then transform the security requirements for 5G ProSe U2N Relay communication as formal security properties, and provide two formal faithful security models for the 5G ProSe AKA protocols. We adopt the state-of-the-art formal verification tool Tamarin to achieve automated security analysis on two models through new proof strategies, and then find some significant and unexpected flaws. Finally, we propose corresponding measures that have least impact on standards based on the analysis on the attacks. Given that the version of Release 17 (R17) of the 3GPP standard has just been frozen, our work can provide a reference for the subsequent evolution of the protocols in 5G ProSe.}

	abstract = {Pseudonyms used in Online social networks (OSNs) post a great challenge to fighting against cyber crimes. To build a strong case, law enforcement may want to link multiple user accounts with pseudonyms to a physical suspect. Images based camera fingerprinting has been used for account linking when a suspect takes pictures and videos with his camera and posts them online. However, image post-processing software may introduce noise into images. This noise is hard to eliminate by conventional strategies, is partly resident in the estimated photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) fingerprints, and interferes with matching fingerprints. We define this noise as software noise, which pollutes PRNU fingerprints and affects accounts linking in online social networks. In this article, we propose new approaches for camera fingerprint matching given software noise. The key idea is to determine the PRNU hardware noise correlation component with our new test statistic–fingerprint to software noise ratio (FITS). We performed extensive experiments and 10,000+ images taken by 90+ smartphones were used to validate our robust camera fingerprint matching system. The experiment results show FITS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for polluted fingerprints. This is the first work studying camera fingerprint matching with the presence of software noise.}

	abstract = {Wireless charging is widely used to charge smart devices with limited battery capacity. However, it is susceptible to the identity spoofing attack, where adversaries can impersonate malicious devices as legitimate ones to gain unauthorized access and potentially disrupt the wireless charging system (e.g., resulting in incorrect billing, overheating, or even explosions). Device fingerprinting is a classical method for defending against identity spoofing attacks. However, applying existing schemes in wireless charging scenarios has drawbacks such as inconvenience (e.g., requiring specialized devices or user participation) and ineffectiveness (e.g., vulnerability to spoofing). Thus, we design a novel passive, effective, and robust device fingerprinting scheme called MagID for wireless charging systems. The insight of MagID lies in the fact that during wireless charging, the magnetic signal around a device can reflect inherent hardware differences. These differences can be extracted as unique fingerprints for authentication purposes. MagID leverages a novel scheme, SUPER-ARRAY, to precisely measure magnetic data and generate effective fingerprints for authenticating a device's identity before starting charging progress. Experimental results demonstrate that MagID achieves an accuracy rate of 98.14% across various charging devices. We have also tested its performance under different impact factors and verified its compatibility with various wireless charging pads.}

	abstract = {Recently, adversarial machine learning attacks have posed serious security threats against practical audio signal classification systems, including speech recognition, speaker recognition, music copyright detection. Most existing studies have mainly focused on ensuring the effectiveness of attacking an audio signal classifier via creating a noise-like perturbation on the original signal, which remains a gap in preserving the human perception of adversarial audios. This paper presents a novel perspective to create adversarial audios by integrating the human perception model into the attack formulation to generate well-perceived adversarial examples. Different from conventional approaches which primarily focused on using  L_{p} L p L_{p}  norm to preserve the audio quality, we adopt a human study to understand how human participants react to different types of music perturbations, build a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) based model to characterize the human perception. The new findings of the human perception study guide us to formulate a new computationally efficient, multiple-feature-based perception-aware (CEMF-PA) attack, which manipulates different audio signal features to find an optimal perturbed music signal against music copyright detection. This novel attack vector opens a new door to generating highly effective, well-perceived adversarial audio signals via manipulating the auditory features. Experimental results show that the proposed attack is effective against YouTube’s copyright detection. Finally, we propose the defense strategy design to make the copyright detection more robust to adversarial music signals generated by the CEMF-PA attack.}

	abstract = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) helps improve the task computational performance of vehicles on roads but has difficulty in defending against eavesdropping and selfish attacks simultaneously. In this paper, we design a reputation-based smart contract with blockchain and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) based secure offloading scheme for VEC against both eavesdropping and selfish attacks. This scheme has a three-level hierarchical structure for each vehicle and uses the reputations obtained from the blockchain as the basis to optimize the edge node selection, offloading ratio, and power allocation, which aims to reduce the task computational latency, the vehicle energy consumption and eavesdropping rate. By using a punishment function based on the constraints, this scheme avoids exploring dangerous policies that can cause task failure or severe data leakage. A multi-agent deep RL-based secure offloading scheme is proposed for vehicles with sufficient resources, which evaluates the long-term risk rather than the punishment function to further improve the secure offloading performance. The regret bound is analyzedand the cumulative reward upper bound is provided. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our schemes as compared with the benchmark.}

	abstract = {In recent years, reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDH-ED) has garnered considerable interest among researchers, resulting in the development of high-performance methods based on various carriers. However, the challenge of enhancing the data embedding capacity while ensuring reversibility becomes increasingly pronounced when the carrier is a three-dimensional (3D) model. In this paper, a high capacity RDH-ED method based on dynamic prediction and virtual connection for 3D models is proposed. Unlike existing methods that partition the vertices in the model into embeddable and prediction sets, where each vertex can only serve one function, the proposed dynamic prediction mechanism constructs a data embedding order set by leveraging the connectivity relationships between vertices. This allows each vertex within the set to both embed data and provide predictions, significantly increasing the proportion of embeddable vertices. Moreover, the proposed method is the first work to consider independent vertices within the model and integrates a novel virtual connection approach with the dynamic prediction process, enabling all independent vertices to participate in data embedding and prediction, thereby further enhancing the data embedding capacity. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of data embedding capacity while ensuring reversibility.}

	abstract = {Detailed system operations are recorded in logs. To ensure system reliability, developers can detect system anomalies through log anomaly detection. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log messages into structured data, is a crucial step in log anomaly detection and advanced program analysis and verification. Despite the availability of various log parsing tools, they generally suffer from low parsing accuracy and slow efficiency due to the ignorance of variable characteristics and the use of costly pairwise comparison methods. In this paper, we propose a TCMS framework to parse logs, consisting of two main technologies. First, by studying 16 public log datasets, we find that most log variable tokens are structured variable tokens. Based on this discovery, we propose a token conversion algorithm to improve parsing accuracy. This algorithm converts the changed parts in structured variable tokens into wildcards (‘ < *>  < *>  ’), preventing these tokens from being directly identified as constant tokens. Second, to improve efficiency, we propose the LogMLCS algorithm, which intelligently constructs a graph to facilitate the extraction of common parts from multiple log messages at once, instead of using pairwise comparisons. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 16 log datasets reveal that our TCMS outperforms seven other parsing methods, achieving the highest parsing accuracy at the fastest speed. Furthermore, experimental results from running a log anomaly detection algorithm in conjunction with different log parsing methods demonstrate that TCMS significantly boosts detection accuracy. For instance, on the OpenStack dataset, our TCMS-facilitated log anomaly detection algorithm achieves a perfect F1-score, precision, and recall of 100% each, surpassing the best peer method by 32.2, 0.8, and 19.5 percentage points, respectively.}

	abstract = {Companies such as CrowdStrike now offer cloud-based services for provenance analysis, which collects low-level system events from a customer's device and compiles them onto a centralized platform to detect APT attacks. Despite the effectiveness of such solutions, their privacy implications remain unclear. To assess the privacy implications of system provenance analysis, we employ the Website Fingerprinting (WF) of The Onion Router (Tor) browsers as the real-world attack scenario. In contrast to conventional, network traffic-based WF techniques, we have designed ProvAudit, a fully automated solution that audits the web browsing history of Tor browsers based on system provenance data. We conduct the first systematic case study to demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the websites visited by Tor browsers solely based on the collected system provenance data, particularly system call traces. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves a precision of 0.74 in the open-world scenario, higher than the state-of-the-art robust WF technique. In practice, ProvAudit consumes approximately 23 MB of memory and 4% CPU to audit system provenance data. Our approach is more robust against simple adversarial methods, more accurate, and less expensive than existing solutions. Overall, our case study reveals that provenance data is susceptible to privacy breaches, potentially exposing more high-level information than anticipated.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for encoding binary strings of fixed-length into a word of constant Hamming weight and constant length. The primary difference compared to previous publications is that the proposed algorithm can be directly applied to binary strings of fixed-length, without including a variable number of random bits needed to ensure the success of the encoding. The algorithm is useful for many post-quantum encryption schemes, in which a constant weight word is required. Additionally, a constant-time version of the algorithm is proposed, in order to mitigate information leakage vulnerabilities that could be exploited in potential timing attacks. An application based on a post-quantum Classic McEliece cryptosystem, using different security levels, is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and correctness of our approach along with its advantages when compared with other solutions proposed in the past.}

However, this opens the door for potential malware hijacking attacks. In our study, we unveiled Android’s insufficient security measures against malware activity in multi-window modes, and identified strategies on how to bypass these measures. We first introduced long-term monitoring methods through background services or malicious sub-window activities, and then designed and implemented 7 multi-window hijacking strategies to achieve multi-window hijacking in the three mainstream multi-window modes. To evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the attacks, we ran the hijacking in different system versions supporting multi-window solutions, and simulated the hijacking on 262 popular apps. All of the apps suffer from at least two types of multi-window hijacking attacks, and more than 65% of them can be attacked by all the 7 multi-window hijacking attacks. Furthermore, we designed and distributed a questionnaire to gather user opinions towards these attacks. 85% of respondents believe that the multi-window hijacking is highly covert and difficult to defend against. Of significance, we received acknowledgement and award fund from development teams of impactful apps.}

	abstract = {Graph clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the nodes in a graph into different groups. Despite achieving significant progress in exploiting both attributed and structured data information, graph clustering methods often face practical challenges related to data isolation. Moreover, the absence of collaborative methods for graph clustering limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a collaborative graph clustering framework for attributed graphs, supporting attributed graph clustering over vertically partitioned data with different participants holding distinct features of the same data. Our method leverages a novel technique that reduces the sample space, improving the efficiency of the attributed graph clustering method. Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart under a proximity condition, demonstrating that the successful local results of each participant contribute to the overall success of the collaboration. We fully implement our approach and evaluate its utility and efficiency by conducting experiments on four public datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy levels to centralized attributed graph clustering methods. Our collaborative graph clustering framework provides an efficient and effective solution for graph clustering challenges related to data isolation.}

	abstract = {Decentralized identity (DID) is rapidly emerging as a promising alternative to centralized identity infrastructure, offering numerous real-world applications. However, existing DID systems are confronted with trust concerns, as any distributed node can act as a credential issuer and be considered trusted, which is impractical. Effective trust management (TM) protocols are critical for system trustworthiness but face two primary challenges: preserving user feedback privacy to meet regulation requirements and building resilience against trust attacks to prevent manipulation. While privacy-preserving TM protocols effectively safeguard sensitive data, they often obscure feedback, hindering anomaly detection and complicating efforts to counter trust attacks. To address these issues, we propose DidTrust, a novel decentralized identity trust management protocol that bridges data privacy and resilience to trust attacks. DidTrust features a feedback data privacy preservation protocol that conceals feedback data while maintaining authorizability and verifiability. It also implements countermeasures against cooperative and individual trust attacks, improving detection accuracy without compromising privacy. To improve efficiency, we introduce a feedback compression module for large-scale sparse matrices. Rigorous analysis proves DidTrust to be universally composable (UC) secure under a malicious model, and experiments demonstrate its improved computational and storage efficiency while achieving higher trust attack detection rates compared to BC-Trust.}

This may be a significant hurdle unless the original microdata are multivariate normal. We propose a rank-based approach to generating synthetic microdata based on the permutation paradigm. We present three different methods and we analyze the utility and the confidentiality they afford. The third method is actually an extension of the second method that adds  k k -anonymity protection against reidentification to the confidentiality against attribute disclosure offered by the first two methods. Our algorithms only require the identification of the marginal distributions of attributes and yield synthetic attributes that replicate the relationships between the original attributes exclusively based on ranks.

	abstract = {Cloud-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm to compensate for the disadvantage of limited resources in IoT and extend the functional boundary of IoT. How to preserve the data privacy while identifying the data source in cloud-assisted IoT is a huge challenge and many cryptographic primitives such as matchmaking encryption (ME) are hence introduced to reach this goal. However, we observe that these tools fail to deal with some rigorous cases in which the data owner does not want anyone to disclose the entire data and even authorized users can only obtain a specified part. In this article, to address such issue, we design a privacy-preserving data computing system with bilateral access control (PDCS-BAC) for cloud-assisted IoT based on a new primitive called identity-based matchmaking functional encryption (IB-MFE). We give the formal definition and security model of IB-MFE, then present two concrete IB-MFE schemes for inner-product function. Thus, PDCS-BAC manages to simultaneously provide flexible privacy computation with enhanced data privacy, bilateral access control, and data authenticity. Finally, we conduct comprehensive performance evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of our schemes for cloud-assisted IoT.}

	abstract = {Data recovery is a fundamental task for sparse network monitoring with a significant impact on many downstream tasks, such as congestion control, network capacity planning, and traffic engineering. To better capture the network dynamically and quickly respond to network failure, network monitoring systems take finer temporal granularity to collect data to form a real-time view of the network. Unfortunately, the current data recovery for network monitoring relies on matrix and tensor completion algorithms, which fail to satisfy the requirements of real-time recovery. To combat this problem, in this paper, we propose Real-Time Event-based Streaming Network Monitoring Data Recovery (EventMon) that achieves ultra-low latency data recovery in network measurement data streams. Specifically, we leverage a mixture of offline and online architecture, with the offline component learns to capture the historical spatial-temporal correlation while the online component is a novel streaming encoder that updates factor matrices incrementally. To enable training our event-level stream processing module, we devise a novel Stream2Batch algorithm to enable mini-batch style training and ensure the encoder generates the same results with one-by-one stream processing. We conduct extensive experiments on three network monitoring datasets and our evaluation and analysis of the experimental results demonstrate shows that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy, inference latency, and high processing throughput.}

	abstract = {TLS 1.3 is widely used to realize secure communication over the Internet. Existing security analyses of TLS 1.3 primarily focus on its handshake protocol which is indeed an authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol, and implicitly neglect the so-called subversion attacks (e.g., breaking TLS via Dual EC) in the real world. Reverse firewall (RF) is a prevalent approach to defend against subversion attack. To the best of our knowledge, the only two subversion-resilient AKE protocols with RFs are proposed by Dodis et al. (CRYPTO’16) and Bossuat et al. (ESORICS’20). The security of both protocols is proved under game-based model which is insufficient for the concurrent execution of multiple TLS instances in practice. In this paper, we propose  \\mathsf {srTLS} \\mathsf {srTLS} , a variant of the TLS 1.3 full one round-trip time (1-RTT) handshake protocol with RFs under the universally composable (UC) model. In particular, we first present the ideal functionality of unilateral AKE  \\mathcal {F}_{\\mathsf {uaKE}} \\mathcal {F}_{\\mathsf {uaKE}} . Then, we use RFs with outer transparency to circumvent the difficulty in sanitizing the messages of handshake protocol, and prove that  \\mathsf {srTLS} \\mathsf {srTLS}  UC-realizes  \\mathcal {F}_{\\mathsf {uaKE}} \\mathcal {F}_{\\mathsf {uaKE}}  in the presence of subversion attacks. Finally, we integrate  \\mathsf {srTLS} \\mathsf {srTLS}  and existing subversion-resilient AKE protocols into TLS 1.3. The evaluation result demonstrates that  \\mathsf {srTLS} \\mathsf {srTLS}  achieves at least a 44.86% efficiency improvement over other subversion-resilient AKE protocols.}

	abstract = {Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms have gained popularity due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, scalability, and rapid development capabilities. However, recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of cloud-based models in MLaaS to model extraction attacks. In this paper, we introduce FDINet, a novel defense mechanism that leverages the feature distribution of deep neural network (DNN) models. Concretely, by analyzing the feature distribution from the adversary’s queries, we reveal that the feature distribution of these queries deviates from that of the model’s problem domain. Based on this key observation, we propose Feature Distortion Index (FDI), a metric designed to quantitatively measure the feature distribution deviation of received queries. The proposed FDINet utilizes FDI to train a binary detector and exploits FDI similarity to identify colluding adversaries from distributed extraction attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate FDINet against six state-of-the-art extraction attacks on four benchmark datasets and four popular model architectures. Empirical results demonstrate the following findings: 1) FDINet proves to be highly effective in detecting model extraction, achieving a 100% detection accuracy on DFME and DaST. 2) FDINet is highly efficient, using just 50 queries to raise an extraction alarm with an average confidence of 96.08% for GTSRB. 3) FDINet exhibits the capability to identify colluding adversaries with an accuracy exceeding 91%. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to detect two types of adaptive attacks.}

	abstract = {In cloud computing, it is necessary to outsource image processing algorithms securely without exposing private image content. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a famous local descriptor widely used in computer vision. There are already some privacy-preserving schemes for computing SIFT on encrypted images. However, the state-of-the-art works have to convert fixed-point numbers into their binary representations, which reduces efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving SIFT scheme built from secure protocols designed explicitly for fixed-point numbers to solve this problem. Specifically, using RLWE-based homomorphic encryption, we propose word-wise protocols to perform secure division, square root operation, comparison, derivation, and matrix inversion in a single-instruction multiple-data manner. These protocols allow direct processing of fixed-point numbers without converting them to binary numbers, thus achieving high computational efficiency. We have also realized critical SIFT steps missing from previous works, including euclidean gradient amplitude computation, histogram peak interpolation, and precise interval localization, leading to improved accuracy of SIFT features in the encrypted domain. We conduct security analysis and perform extensive experiments to evaluate the execution efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.}

	abstract = {Android system provides application developers with the ability to define custom permissions, which serve to moderate the sharing of resources and interactionswith other applications. However, poor development practices of developers can render the permission mechanism ineffective, weakening the system protection. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the problematic practices surrounding custom permissions employed by developers, referred to as Bad Practices of Custom Permissions (BPCP issues). To accomplish this, we conducted an empirical study and identified nine common BPCP issue patterns that can lead to various adverse consequences, such as installation failures, crashes, oreven component hijacking. To automatically identify these patterns of bad practices, we devised PERMEAGRE, a static analysis tool. Using PERMEAGRE, we performed a large-scale analysis of 83,085 applications obtained from seven major app markets, aiming to detect instances of BPCP issues. The results revealed that more than 26% of the analyzed apps contained at least one issue, and a significant number of apps had garnered millions of downloads. Drawing from the empirical results, we further systemize the underlying root causes of these issues. Consequently, this analysis sheds light on the potential threat landscape associated with bad practices in custom permissions, emphasizing the urgent requirement for effective mitigation strategies.}

	abstract = {Conventional federated learning (FL) coordinated by a central server focuses on training a global model and protecting the privacy of clients’ training data by storing it locally. However, the statistical heterogeneity hinders the global model from adapting to the non-IID distributions among clients. Moreover, untrusted and unreliable central servers and malicious clients may compromise model integrity and availability, thus degrading the robustness of FL. To address these challenges, we present RobustPFL, a decentralized personalized federated learning (PFL) approach that combines  \\alpha \\alpha -based Layer-position Normalized Similarity ( \\alpha \\alpha -LNS) and local collaborative training to improve personalized performance while utilizing a blockchain-based committee mechanism to coordinate the aggregation process, thereby achieving high personalized accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments show that our RobustPFL approach outperforms multiple algorithms, including Local training, FedAvg, FedReptile, Per-FedAvg, FedBN, and SPFL, on MNIST, CIFAR10, EMNIST, and N-BaIoT datasets in four non-IID settings. We also evaluate RobustPFL’s effectiveness against attacks—poisoning attacks and free-riding attacks. Particularly, for three prevalent poisoning attacks (backdoor, label flipping, and model poisoning attacks), we compare non-defensive (FedAvg) and defensive (Krum, trimmed mean, Bulyan, FedBN, FLAME, and FangTrmean) methods with our proposed RobustPFL. The results show that our approach achieves significant defensive effects.}

	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a popular solution for providing multi-tenant network services on top of existing cloud infrastructures in an agile and cost-effective manner. However, as NFV employs multiple levels of virtualization, it also introduces novel security challenges, such as cloud-level security breaches that are invisible to NFV-level tenants. Towards verifying the security of NFV across all the levels (a.k.a. cross-level security verification), existing solutions are mostly insufficient, as each such solution typically only focuses on one specific level (e.g., cloud, SDN, or SFC), and verifying every level separately would be expensive or even infeasible. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical system, NFVGuard+, for cross-level security verification for NFV. Particularly, the efficiency of NFVGuard+ is achieved by first performing the costly security verification at one level, and then extrapolating the verification result to other levels through conducting relatively lightweight consistency checks. Additionally, the practicality of NFVGuard+ is ensured by automating the essential steps (e.g., identifying security properties, collecting verification data, and conducting verification) based on a novel Entity-Relationship (ER) model of NFV stack, integrating the approach with OpenStack/Tacker (a popular choice for an NFV deployment), and finally evaluating its effectiveness using both synthetic and real data.}

	abstract = {Deep models excel in analyzing image data. However, recent studies on Black-Box Model Inversion (MI) Attacks against image models have revealed the potential to recover concealed (via specific masks) private training images using publicly available images from the same domain as the training data. This study introduces PriDM, a novel diffusion model-based MI attack, illustrating the increased vulnerability of image models. PriDM leverages range-null space decomposition to extract essential range-space information and incorporates it into the diffusion model's sampling process. This enables the recovery of private information from arbitrarily masked images relying solely on images only aligned with the same machine-learning tasks as the target model. To demonstrate PriDM's effectiveness, we conducted experiments with various adversary background knowledge, including different public dataset domains and image masks. Results show PriDM produces recovered images of significantly higher quality, approximately twice as good as existing methods. Moreover, in scenarios involving complex backgrounds, PriDM outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 70%. In specific background knowledge scenarios, such as compressed and blurred images, our method achieves an almost 100% success rate. Additionally, PriDM performs well with real-world background knowledge including individuals wearing masks and randomly masked face images, which are not considered by existing works.}

	abstract = {Approximate membership query (AMQ) structures represented by the Bloom Filter and its variants have been popularly researched in recent years. Researchers have recently combined machine learning with this type of structure to reduce space consumption and computation overhead further and make remarkable progress. However, with the booming performance in space or other metrics, researchers tend to ignore the security of the trained model. The machine learning model is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and naturally, we infer that the learning-based filters also have the same deficiencies. Hence, in this article, to confirm the inference mentioned above, experiments on the real-world datasets of URLs are conducted and prove that it is necessary to consider the security issue when using learning-based filters. We show that by data poisoning, the attacker can deflect learned Bloom Filters to make a false identification, which can lead to a significant loss in some cases. Aiming to solve this issue, we put forward a method named Defensive Learned Bloom Filter (DLBF) to diminish the influence of data poisoning and achieve a better performance compared to types of learned Bloom Filters.}

Our model covers remote attestation, key derivation, page swap and live migration. We analyze the security of the software interface of SEV-SNP and formally prove that most critical secrecy, authentication, attestation and freshness properties do indeed hold in the model. Furthermore, we find that the platform-agnostic nature of messages exchanged between SNP guests and the AMD Secure Processor firmware presents a potential weakness in the design. We show how this weakness leads to formal attacks on multiple security properties, including the partial compromise of attestation report integrity, and discuss possible impacts and mitigations.}

	abstract = {Physical adversarial examples (AEs) have become an increasing threat to deploying deep neural network (DNN) models in the real world. Popular approaches adopt sticking-based or projecting-based strategies that stick the printed adversarial patches to objects or directly project the AE onto objects. Although effective, these methods require access to target objects and generate visible artifacts, which reduces the attack's stealthiness. In this article, we propose MagShadow, a new attack vector that leverages imperceptible electromagnetic (EM) signals to realize physical AEs. MagShadow utilizes the CCD camera sensor's susceptibility to EM injection attacks and induces fine-grained adversarial perturbations on the camera's captured image by injecting carefully-crafted signals with a low-cost portable device. As MagShadow directly manipulates the image sensor's output with EM signals, the attack requires no access to the target object and can keep stealthy. We study the feasibility of MagShadow in two typical DNN application scenarios (image classification and object detection) and design a framework to implement four different types of attacks, i.e., untargeted, targeted, hiding, and appearing attacks. Extensive real-world experiments on five different cameras are conducted, which demonstrate MagShadow's effectiveness against different popular DNN models (Inception v3, ResNet101, YOLO v3/v4).}

	abstract = {Hybrid testing, combining fuzz testing and concolic execution, has emerged as an effective technique for bug discovery. However, concolic execution becomes the performance bottleneck when applied to real-world software. Despite numerous approaches to optimize seed scheduling, symbolic simulation, and constraint solving, concolic execution remains inefficient and ineffective due to two limitations. First, the concolic executor and fuzzer do not synchronize the testing state in real time, leading to the generation of numerous duplicate inputs in both concolic execution and the fuzzer. Second, the concolic executor overlooks the independence of constraint solving and solves constraints sequentially, which introduces significant slowdown. In this paper, we first conduct a study to identify these limitations in existing hybrid testing systems. We then propose a novel design for hybrid fuzzing, CherryPicker, where the fuzzer and concolic executor share testing states, and concolic execution runs in parallel mode. Finally, we evaluate our system using the LAVA-M benchmark and real-world software and compare it to state-of-the-art systems. The results demonstrate that CherryPicker outperforms current systems in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, delivering improved runtime performance, generating more intriguing inputs, and activating more code. Notably, CherryPicker exclusively uncovers six previously unknown bugs during the evaluation, which have been reported to developers, all of which have been confirmed with three CVEs assigned.}

Simultaneously, we design a QUIC-based extension to distribute authentication information. Pisces incorporates a translator module and a filter module, which accurately identifies malicious and legitimate traffic.

	abstract = {In recent years, mobile ransomware attacks have become increasingly prevalent, especially in Android systems. Android ransomware extorts users by maliciously locking infected devices or encrypting user files on the devices. To address this problem, we propose RansomSentry, a runtime detection system with compiler-based instrumentation against both lock-screen and crypto ransomware in Android. Specifically, RansomSentry leverages a modified Android dex2oat compiler to instrument the sensitive APIs invoked by ransomware during the installation of a target app, and monitors the app's screen-related and file access operations at runtime to detect attacks. Compared to previous solutions, RansomSentry does not require to change the app's APK file and bytecode, thus it will pass the original integrity check of the app, which makes it readily deployed by users. Further, such a dynamic approach is naturally immune to code or data obfuscation and can provide real-time protection. To validate our approach, we implement a prototype of RansomSentry and collect 2,376 recent Android ransomware samples to evaluate it. The evaluation results show that our prototype can effectively detect ransomware attacks with an acceptable performance overhead.}

To address this challenge, we proposes DBSSL, a scheme that can efficiently detect backdoor attacks in self-supervised learning models. In DBSSL, we connect backdoor attacks with adversarial attacks and use adversarial perturbations for detection. Specifically, we first conduct targeted adversarial attacks on the samples, classifying them into different classes. Then, we employ the Z-Score method to analyze these adversarial perturbations. If outliers are present, we can infer that the self-supervised learning model has been backdoored. Unlike previous works, our scheme is better suited for downstream users with constrained computation resources and exhibits excellent detection capabilities for backdoor attacks caused by patch-type or global triggers. Abundant theoretical analysis has demonstrated the feasibility of our scheme. Moreover, extensive experiments show that our method performs well in detecting prevalent backdoor attacks in self-supervised learning, achieving detection accuracy exceeding 95%.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative model training without sharing private data. However, privacy concerns regarding information exchanged during FL have received significant research attention. Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) have been proposed to reconstruct the private data retained by local clients from the exchanged gradients. While recovering private data, the data dimensions and the model complexity increase, which thwart data reconstruction by GIAs. Existing methods adopt prior knowledge about private data to overcome those challenges. In this article, we first observe that GIAs with gradients from a single iteration fail to reconstruct private data due to insufficient dimensions of leaked gradients, complex model architectures, and invalid gradient information. We investigate a Temporal Gradient Inversion Attack with a Robust Optimization framework, called TGIAs-RO, which recovers private data without any prior knowledge by leveraging multiple temporal gradients. To eliminate the negative impacts of outliers, e.g., invalid gradients for collaborative optimization, robust statistics are proposed. Theoretical guarantees on the recovery performance and robustness of TGIAs-RO against invalid gradients are also provided. Extensive empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet and Reuters 21578 datasets show that the proposed TGIAs-RO with 10 temporal gradients improves reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even for large batch sizes (up to 128), complex models like ResNet18, and large datasets like ImageNet (224× 224pixels). Furthermore, the proposed attack method inspires further exploration of privacy-preserving methods in the context of FL.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) trains a global model by aggregating local updates from multiple clients under a server's guidance. Despite its potential, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks where malicious clients intentionally corrupt their updates, compromising the global model's accuracy. Current defense strategies aim to tolerate or remove such corrupt updates, but they are not fully effective to prevent malicious clients from sending poisonous updates to the server, leaving the global model at risk. We propose a novel approach based on the evolution of cooperation, which promotes system-wide collaboration. Our defense method allows the server to selectively engage clients in the training process, encouraging them to provide clean updates or exclude those persistently malicious. We also introduce an attack framework where clients initially send clean updates to gain trust before sending malicious ones later. This model, designed to simulate advanced threats, can adapt to various attack types to increase its impact. Our experimental results show that this defense significantly improves resilience against such attacks, effectively safeguarding the global model even under complex threat scenarios.}

	abstract = {With the continuous development of digitization evolutions, vehicular digital twin networks (VDTNs) facilitate traffic data and optimization results to be exchanged between the vehicle and digital twin as well as shared among a group of digital twins. However, the data exchange and group sharing processes take place in real-time over public communication channels, which suffer from various security and privacy threats. Key agreement technologies are promising to enable secure data communications for entities, but the existing key agreement schemes generally fail to fulfill the requirements of synchronization, privacy, and entity management for VDTNs. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving and synchronized key agreement scheme for VDTNs. In the proposed scheme, the anonymous vehicle and digital twin can negotiate a secret session key in the case of synchronization to achieve secure data exchange. Meanwhile, digital twins are capable of utilizing synchronized state information to dynamically establish a common group encryption key but hold individual decryption keys, which guarantee the security of group sharing. Additionally, the proposed scheme is able to protect identity privacy and manage vehicles and digital twins with the assistance of blockchain and smart contract. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides security and privacy assurances for VDTNs. The performance evaluation indicates that it has excellent expressions in terms of efficiency, practicality, and smart contract consumption.}

In the implementation perspective, distinctive features are: definition of a custom-made extensible metamodel to specify the system structure and failure logic; automated derivation of metamodel instances from Systems Modeling Language (SysML) Block Definition Diagrams (BDDs) and Stochastic Static Fault Trees (SSFTs); automated derivation of the mentioned dependability measures; open source availability.

	abstract = {Crypto-ransomware attacks have been a growing threat over the last few years. The goal of every ransomware strain is encrypting user data, such that attackers can later demand users a ransom for unlocking their data. To maximise their earning chances, attackers equip their ransomware with strong encryption which produce files with high entropy values. Davies et al. proposed Differential Area Analysis (DAA), a technique that analyses files headers to differentiate compressed, regularly encrypted, and ransomware-encrypted files. In this paper, first we propose three different attacks to perform malicious header manipulation and bypass DAA detection. Then, we propose three countermeasures, namely 2-Fragments (2F), 3-Fragments (3F), and 4-Fragments (4F), which can be applied equally against each of the three attacks we propose. We conduct a number of experiments to analyse the ability of our countermeasures to detect ransomware-encrypted files, whether implementing our proposed attacks or not. Last, we test the robustness of our own countermeasures by analysing the performance, in terms of files per second analysed and resilience to extensive injection of low-entropy data. Our results show that our detection countermeasures are viable and deployable alternatives to DAA.}

	abstract = {Regarding computer security, the growth of code vulnerability types presents a persistent challenge. These vulnerabilities, which may cause severe consequences, necessitate precise classification for effective mitigation. However, the rapid emergence of new vulnerability types complicates the classification process. Traditional methodologies, which often involve human expertise and the manual labeling or generation of example instances, are not only resource-intensive but also struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of these vulnerabilities. This article introduces VulnSense, an innovative method that harnesses the capabilities of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) to address the vulnerability classification problem. VulnSense learns about unseen vulnerability classes from the descriptions of these unseen classes, while not requiring to see any instances of these unseen classes. Specifically, VulnSense learns from three main resources: 1) seen classes with labeled code instances; 2) descriptions of these seen classes; and 3) descriptions of “unseen” classes which have no labeled instances. Our experiments underscore VulnSense's superiority over existing GZSL methods in classifying instances of unseen classes. Concurrently, it maintains a performance parity with traditional labeled-example based learning methods in classifying instances of seen vulnerabilities. VulnSense demonstrates the potential of using GZSL for vulnerability classification, while also highlighting challenges that inspire future work.}

	abstract = {Textual passwords play an important role among access-control mechanisms and are usually stored as ciphertext in the server. However, an attacker may attempt to hash a large number of candidate passwords to find the match of the target hash of a password database. To crack the password database, attackers in industry usually use the cracking software like Hashcat. Academic researchers recently proposed many data-driven probabilistic models, in which the Probabilistic Context-free Grammars (PCFG, for short) stand out. Despite the great cracking efficiency, the data-driven models are seldom used by industrial practice due to the significant slow generation speed of password candidates. To bridge the gap and promote the efficient data-driven models being practically used in industry, we propose that using parallel techniques to accelerate the candidate password generation, enabling the integration of PCFG models into the practically-used Hashcat tool. To this end, we mainly propose two algorithms to accelerate the password generation for PCFG-based models: first, we design a storage structure with the memory load balance strategy to more evenly store the data structures used to generate passwords; second, we design an algorithm to produce candidate passwords in parallel by different threads. Based on the two algorithms, we propose Parallel_PCFG, and implement Parallel_PCFG upon Hashcat based on its built-in GPU kernel. We comprehensively evaluate Parallel_PCFG against state-of-the-art data-driven models, and find that Parallel_PCFG only takes 14.33% of time to achieve the same cracking rates compared with the best-performing models, paving a way about the integration between PCFG-based models and Hashcat.}

	abstract = {Noise perturbation introduced by differential privacy (DP) could degrade the quality of essential services like dynamic pricing and ride-matching in ride-on-demand (RoD) services. In this paper, we focus on RoD services under an honest-but-curious server, and propose a Pricing-Aware Differentially Private framework (PADP-RoD) to protect users’ location privacy while providing them with high-quality location-based services. Specifically, given that a price multiplier is subject to abrupt changes in response to shifts in supply and demand, especially near hotspots, we propose an adaptive supply and demand aware grid to capture the changes. Powered by the grid, we put forward two utility metrics for quantifying the quality loss of dynamic pricing and ride-matching services caused by perturbation, respectively. With those metrics, PADP-RoD is formulated as a minimization problem, aiming to minimize the quality loss of services given DP constraint. In this way, we can achieve an optimal balance between privacy and service quality. Due to the problem being a multi-objective optimization, we decompose it into a dynamic-pricing utility sub-problem and a ride-matching utility sub-problem, and solve them separately. To solve the dynamic pricing utility sub-problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm named the dynamic pricing mapping algorithm. Since the semi-infinite and non-differentiable nature of the ride-matching utility sub-problem, we transform this sub-problem into an unconstrained problem by the exact penalty function method, and solve it employing the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PADP-RoD satisfies both  \\varepsilon _{d} \\varepsilon _{d} -DP and  \\varepsilon _{d} \\varepsilon _{d} -identifiability, and extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that it can provide high-quality dynamic pricing and ride-matching services.}

	abstract = {Linguistic steganalysis is a technique to distinguish whether a text carrier contains secret information via statistical features. Current state-of-the-art methods are caught in two constraints. First, they cannot make accurate predictions on unlearned text distributions. In other words, the performance relies on the consistency of the training and testing distributions. Second, sufficient samples are required to fine-tune these models to reach their optimal states. In this article, we break through these obstacles by developing an effective steganalysis framework in a few-shot scenario. We first build the meta-datasets to simulate the real-world steganalysis environment that contains multi-distributional source and target domains with sparse target-domain samples. Then we propose a few-shot linguistic steganalysis framework combined with an adversarial meta-training mechanism to learn task-transferable features from source task sets to target tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show our model has a stable capability to learn transferable knowledge in detecting steganalysis tasks with extremely few-shot samples. We also validate the effectiveness of the model through multi-class steganalysis experiments to identify extra steganographic information involving embedding algorithms and capacities. Our proposed framework is effectively demonstrated to compensate for the drawback of state-of-the-art methods and tremendously improve the detection performance.}

The effectiveness of existing defenses is susceptible to the latest model poisoning attacks, leading to a decrease in prediction accuracy. Besides, these defenses are intractable to distinguish benign outliers from malicious gradients, which further compromises the model generalization. In this work, we propose a novel proactive defense named  {\\sf RECESS} {\\sf RECESS}  against model poisoning attacks. Different from the passive analysis in previous defenses,  {\\sf RECESS} {\\sf RECESS}  proactively queries each participating client with a delicately constructed aggregation gradient, accompanied by the detection of malicious clients according to their responses with higher accuracy. Furthermore, RECESS uses a new trust scoring mechanism to robustly aggregate gradients. Unlike previous methods that score each iteration, RECESS considers clients’ performance correlation across multiple iterations to estimate the trust score, substantially increasing fault tolerance. Finally, we extensively evaluate  {\\sf RECESS} {\\sf RECESS}  on typical model architectures and four datasets under various settings. We also evaluated the defensive effectiveness against other types of poisoning attacks, the sensitivity of hyperparameters, and adaptive adversarial attacks. Experimental results show the superiority of  {\\sf RECESS} {\\sf RECESS}  in terms of reducing accuracy loss caused by the latest model poisoning attacks over five classic and two state-of-the-art defenses.}

Identifying the root causes of these techniques is crucial for developing effective defense mechanisms. However, the unstructured nature and inconsistent terminology of CTI reports pose significant challenges in extracting causal factors, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and vulnerable data components, limiting proactive responses and the understanding of attack interdependencies. To address these challenges, we propose TRACE, a novel framework that extracts causal factors linked to adversarial techniques and generates comprehensive causal graphs revealing interdependencies within CTI reports. TRACE combines pattern extraction and tagging methods to address the limitations of existing approaches. Utilizing Sentence-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT) embeddings enhanced with knowledge mappings and deep learning techniques, TRACE discovers and models causal relationships between attack techniques within the reports. By bridging the gap between attack techniques and their underlying vulnerabilities, TRACE provides actionable insights to enhance cybersecurity defenses. Evaluated on 710 CTI reports, TRACE achieved an F1 score of 0.87, demonstrating its accuracy in extracting causal factors and its potential to advance automated causal analysis in cybersecurity.}

	abstract = {We propose a new coded blockchain scheme suitable for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) network. In contrast to existing works for coded blockchains, especially blockchain-of-things, the proposed scheme is more realistic, practical, and secure while achieving high throughput. This is accomplished by: 1) modeling the variety of transactions using a reward model, based on which an optimization problem is solved to select transactions that are more accessible and cheaper computational-wise to be processed together; 2) a transaction-based and lightweight consensus algorithm that emphasizes on using the minimum possible number of miners for processing the transactions; and 3) employing the raptor codes with linear-time encoding and decoding which results in requiring lower storage to maintain the blockchain and having a higher throughput. We provide detailed analysis and simulation results on the proposed scheme and compare it with the state-of-the-art coded IoT blockchain schemes including Polyshard and LCB, to show the advantages of our proposed scheme in terms of security, storage, decentralization, and throughput.}

Meanwhile, Near-Memory Processing (NMP) has shown performance and energy benefits on memory-intensive workloads. Recently, novel memory encryption schemes have been proposed to allow TEEs to leverage the benefits of NMP without requiring trust in the NMP components. In this paper, we present a system design of confidential computing with NMP that can be directly used in Intel SGX, a TEE platform available in commercial processors today. We develop the full software stack and evaluate the results on commercial processors with the emulated AxDIMM, an FPGA-based NMP platform. In our case study on personalized Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) inference, the proposed confidential computing in NMP achieves up to 1.51× latency reduction and up to 2.57× throughput improvement.}

	abstract = {We study an intriguing and practical scenario of online Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), in which workers have the flexibility to perform tasks using various methods, such as walking, driving, or utilizing remote aerial vehicles (RAVs). This results in workers having heterogeneous, arbitrary, and non-stationary utilities over time. We refer to this scenario as integrated SC. Unfortunately, existing studies are limited in addressing integrated SC settings due to two aspects: (1) these studies are based on the assumption that workers’ utilities are independently and identically distributed and follow a stationary distribution like Gaussian, which does not hold in integrated SC; (2) their approaches fail to provide personalized privacy preservation for different workers. Motivated by these limitations, we closely investigate the heterogeneous utility and personalized privacy requirement in integrated SC and propose an Online Personalized Privacy-preserving Selection framework (OPPS). In this framework, we present an online selection policy that balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off given heterogeneous utilities and develop a built-in privacy policy that ensures differential privacy guarantee. We then demonstrate that our framework effectively addresses the trade-off by deriving a sublinear, privacy-related upper bound on regret that scales as  O(\\sqrt{T}) O(\\sqrt{T}) . Extensive numerical simulations based on real-world drone datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our framework compared with state-of-the-art approaches.}

Despite that, ChatGPT could facilitate academic misconduct by easily generating codes and text as solutions for assignments. More alarmingly, ChatGPT can be used to write polymorphic malware. Moreover, ChatGPT-generated codes are shown to be less secure. While the detection of text generated by ChatGPT has been addressed, ChatGPT code authorship attribution is largely unexplored. In this article, we examine attributing ChatGPT codes using off-the-shelf code authorship attribution techniques. We demonstrate that the answer to the question is negative, necessitating a new approach, which we also deliver by scrutinizing the outcomes of the off-the-shelf attribution technique. We found that grouping ChatGPT codes using the inference step of a pretrained model on non-ChatGPT codes can be used as an accurate attribution model. Compared with the 8.3%–29.2% accuracy of the naive approach, our approach delivers 81.3%–91.7% while costing a small trade-off in the accuracy of detecting target (non-ChatGPT) authors. Moreover, the straightforward authorship attribution model trained for the binary classification (ChatGPT versus Human) achieved a classification accuracy of 87% with 6 K code samples. Our comprehensive analysis sheds light on the limitations of the styles generated by ChatGPT, making detecting codes generated by ChatGPT feasible.}

	abstract = {As blockchain technology matures and its adoption grows across multiple industries, there is a growing need to make the data stored on blockchains adaptable to prevent misuse. However, such modifications can lead to inconsistency when interacting with other blockchains, necessitating the preservation of dynamic data consistency during these cross-chain interactions. While ensuring consistency for static data is relatively straightforward, doing so for dynamic data with efficiency remains a significant challenge. In response, we propose an efficient dynamic cross-chain data consistency auditing model (EDCA), which artfully integrates an advanced gamma multi-signature approach (AGMS) with the designed dynamic Merkle hash tree (D-MHT) to facilitate effective auditing of the consistency for dynamic data in cross-chain interaction. EDCA can produce relatively small auditor states while maintaining the storage proof. Moreover, EDCA is proven to satisfy strong security and privacy guarantees, tag unforgeability, and proof unforgeability. Experimental evaluations confirm that EDCA has high computational and communicational efficiency and can retain a small and relatively constant auditing overhead.}

	abstract = {There have been significant improvements in intellectual property (IP) protection for deep learning models trained on euclidean data. However, the complex and irregular graph-structured data in non-euclidean space poses a huge challenge to the IP protection of graph neural networks (GNNs). To address this issue, we propose a subtle and interactive GNN fingerprinting scheme through spatial structure inference perturbation, which captures the stable coordination patterns of fingerprint to guarantee the reliability of copyright verification. Specifically, the data augmentation based on adaptive graph diffusion is first exploited to generate more samples, which enables the exploration of fingerprint information from coarse to fine. Subsequently, the graph-structured data are manipulated by multi-constrained spectral clustering to analyze intrinsic and extrinsic structure correlations in a causal inference manner. Ultimately, the cycle-consistent statistical optimization is performed to determine the copyright of GNN models from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our proposed scheme can effectively verify the IP of GNN models on various challenging graph-structured datasets. Furthermore, we reveal that the space causality inference can facilitate the acquisition of inherent structural information, which improves the quality and robustness of the fingerprint under model modification operations and other model stealing attacks.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes RCP, a new reversible coherence protocol that ensures invisible speculative load execution (ISLE) with low overhead. The protocol is designed by systematically extending the existing coherence protocol to incorporate speculative loads and states. Instead of considering the protocol as a black-box and adding external structures or applying patches in previous work, the protocol modifications overcome the key drawbacks in recent schemes that contribute to unnecessary overhead. RCP can be combined with processor mechanisms highlighted in recent work that eliminate the effects of speculative instructions on other instructions to comprehensively protection against speculative execution attacks (a.k.a. ideal invisible speculation or IIS), as strong as speculative taint tracking (STT). The protocol is implemented in Gem5 and verified with Murphi. The results show that, RCP only incurs average overhead of 7.7% and 7.4% for SPEC2017 and PARSEC, respectively. In comparison, MuonTrap, the existing solution with the lowest overhead, incurs 10.7% and 9.3% on average for the two with the same hardware resource. When used as a component for the comprehensive protection, the design based on RCP reduces the overhead of STT by 1.59× (8.4% vs 22.5%).}

	abstract = {AI-enabled critical infrastructures (ACIs) integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into various essential systems and services that are vital to the functioning of society, offering significant implications for efficiency, security and resilience. While adopting decentralized AI approaches (such as federated learning technology) in ACIs is plausible, private and sensitive data are still susceptible to data reconstruction attacks through gradient optimization. In this work, we propose Compressed Differentially Private Aggregation (CDPA), a leakage-resilient, communication-efficient, and carbon-neutral approach for ACI networks. Specifically, CDPA has introduced a novel random bit-flipping mechanism as its primary innovation. This mechanism first converts gradients into a specific binary representation and then selectively flips masked bits with a certain probability. The proposed bit-flipping introduces a larger variance to the noise while providing differentially private protection and commendable efforts in energy savings while applying vector quantization techniques within the context of federated learning. The experimental evaluation indicates that CDPA can reduce communication cost by half while preserving model utility. Moreover, we demonstrate that CDPA can effectively defend against state-of-the-art data reconstruction attacks in both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We highlight existing benchmarks that generate 2.6x to over 100x more carbon emissions than CDPA. We hope that the CDPA developed in this paper can inform the federated AI-enabled critical infrastructure of a more balanced trade-off between utility and privacy, resilience protection, as well as a better carbon offset with less communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Program optimization is a key factor for green software. In the context of the Ethereum blockchain, optimization is particularly relevant because there is a fee to pay for each EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) instruction executed and also there exist bytecode-size limitations for deploying the software on the blockchain. Still, optimization of EVM code is not as widely spread as one could imagine. This is at least partly due to the lack of trust in the correctness of the tools, as security is even more relevant than efficiency in the blockchain context in which bugs may cause huge economical losses. This article develops a formal verification framework using Coq to ensure the security of EVM optimizations performed on jump-free sequences of EVM bytecode. By means of Coq’s theorem proving capabilities, we are able to automatically verify/certify that an optimized jump-free sequence of EVM opcodes is semantically equivalent to a given original one. We also present an extension to our framework that can handle inter-block optimizations that propagate global information across blocks. We have applied our tool to successfully prove the security of peephole optimizations performed by the standard Solidity compiler, and also to existing EVM superoptimization tools (namely GASOL and Superstack) in which we have found bugs that have been reported and fixed.}

	abstract = {Web browsers are implicitly trusted to handle a large amount of private user information. One such piece of private information, a user's browsing history, is maintained by browsers and is used to provide a popular usability feature: Web links are rendered using different styles depending on whether the URLs they point to have been visited or not. Unfortunately, this feature can be abused by malicious webpages in order to extract users’ browsing history. We present new browsing history sniffing attacks through two contention-based side channels which are new in this context: Last-level CPU cache contention, and GPU execution unit contention. The attacks are robust and can be executed successfully against the popular Chrome browser. Compared to prior work which uses the rendering performance as a side channel, our work achieves an attack rate increase of up to 30x. The new attacks are stealthier, because the side channels we use do not slow down the browser's rendering rate. In addition, we revisit the existing sniffing attacks based on the rendering performance side channel, and show how their attack rate can also be increased by a significant amount. Finally, we discuss the root cause of history sniffing attacks and point out solutions.}

	abstract = {Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) excels in utilizing unlabeled data for feature representation learning. However, recent studies have revealed that SSL is vulnerable to data poisoning-based backdoor attacks. To remove backdoored samples from the SSL training dataset, model optimization methods often fine-tune a trained model by contrasting the training dataset with a reserved clean dataset. This contrastive training effectively marginalizes backdoored samples from the distribution of benign ones, if and only if both the reserved clean dataset and the training dataset are from the same data distribution. However, presuming identical distributions between the web-scraped data and reserved data is impractical. To address this impractical assumption, our proposed Bootstrapped Dual Set Purification (AUTO) method distinguishes backdoored from benign samples by contrasting a mined ‘positive set’ and a mined ‘negative set’ within the training dataset itself. We exploit the resistance of backdoored samples in data mixing to mine a highly poisoned ‘positive set’ and a minimally poisoned ‘negative set’. Besides, AUTO mitigates unstable detection performance within different optimization steps by continuously refining the dual sets by the optimized model, enhancing the model's poison distinguishability from consistently improving supervision signals. Our extensive experiments on Cifar10, Cifar100, and Imagenet100 against existing data poisoning SSL backdoor attacks demonstrate AUTO's superiority in detection performance over all existing defenses.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) can retain the structural information of graph data when processing graph data via message passing mechanism. Recently, GNNs have been widely used in recommendation systems, social networks, finance, etc. However, GNNs are also vulnerable when encountering severe security and data privacy challenges. Membership inference attacks (MIA) on graph data can make the trained GNN model leak the training data, which causes serious privacy problems. However, all the studies reviewed so far suffer from the fact that there are few types of research on GNNs to defend against MIA. In this paper, we propose MPGStack: a framework that utilizes ensemble learning of GNNs to safeguard against MIA. More concretely, we propose three ensemble strategies in MPGStack: KFold, GP-KFold, and LPA-KFold, which partition the graph at different degrees of granularity based on random uniform partition, class information, and label propagation, respectively. MPGStack can enhance the target model's generalization performance, mitigate MIA, and boost classification accuracy. The experimental results conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPGStack can effectively defend against MIA and significantly reduce the attack model's success rate to the level of random guessing. MPGStack also improves the classification accuracy of the target model up to 99% or more. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MPGStack is more effective, stable, and applicable to different datasets and scenarios than other methods, achieving random guessing attack models while improving the model's classification accuracy on different datasets.}

	abstract = {Chained HotStuff is a state-of-the-art Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol for building decentralized systems like blockchains. Although chained HotStuff has been widely adopted in many systems, its performance (e.g., throughput and latency) under attacks is still under-explored. In this paper, we develop a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively analyze the performance of chained HotStuff with respect to its chain growth rate, chain quality, and latency. We propose several new attack strategies and evaluate their effects on the performance of chained HotStuff. Our analysis shows that the chain growth rate (resp, chain quality) of chained HotStuff under our attacks can drop to  4/9 4/9  (resp,  12/17 12/17 ) of that without attacks when one-third of nodes are Byzantine. In addition, we use our framework to evaluate a variant of chained HotStuff, DiemBFT and find that some engineering optimizations render it more vulnerable to some attacks than the original chained HotStuff. Finally, we provide two countermeasures, i.e., broadcasting QCs and the longest chain rule, to thwart these attacks. Our analysis shows that the proposed countermeasures can significantly reduce the latency (almost half of that in chained HotStuff) and make it impossible for an attacker to lower the chain quality by simple attacks.}

	abstract = {Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) schemes empower data owners to outsource their encrypted data to clouds while retaining the ability to update or search on it. Despite a lot of efforts devoted in recent years, there are still several challenges that have not been well addressed. First, the confidentiality of data might be compromised if forward privacy and backward privacy cannot be ensured. Second, only the traditional single keyword-file search has attracted tremendous attention, while other popular queries like Boolean queries and range queries are not fully investigated. Lastly, how to solve these problems on untrusted servers that may deviate from pre-defined protocols is also challenging. In this article, aiming to tackle the above problems, we propose a novel DSSE scheme named  {\\sf HeX} {\\sf HeX}  based on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that supports rich queries on untrusted servers while guaranteeing forward and backward privacy. We achieve strong forward and backward security by designing a deferred obfuscating read-write technique atop the bitmap index. We further extend the basic scheme to realize Boolean queries and range queries by reducing them to basic keyword queries. Strict theoretical analysis is conducted to prove the security of  {\\sf HeX} {\\sf HeX} , and extensive evaluations illustrate its efficiency and practicality.}

	abstract = {Introducing the SDN paradigm can further improve the handover efficiency of mobile nodes, and researchers have proposed corresponding solutions to the security problems in the handover process. Some existing cryptography-based schemes delegate authentication to the fog nodes to accelerate the handover process, however, the computation and communication overheads are not low enough to satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive vehicular applications. To realize secure handover of vehicles in software defined vehicular networks (SDVN), in this paper, based on symmetric cryptography, we propose a lightweight and secure handover scheme with conditional privacy-preserving for group-based SDVN. The handover authentication only involves lightweight operation, without based on elliptic curve cryptography or involving complex bilinear pairing operations. After successfully authenticating with the SDN controller, the vehicle can directly authenticate with the fog nodes in the same group. The polynomial and one-way hash chain are used to realize group key update. We use BAN logic and ProVerif to formally analyze and test the security of our scheme. The detailed security analyses show that the scheme can resist common types of attacks and meet the essential security and privacy requirements. Compared with other related and represented works, our scheme exhibits better performance in computation and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) is a promising secure distributed learning paradigm, which enables collaborative training of a global machine learning model through sharing encrypted local models instead of sensitive raw data. PPFL, however, is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. Most existing Byzantine-robust PPFL solutions typically employ two non-colluding servers to achieve secure model detection and aggregation by executing interactive security protocols, which incur considerable computation and communication overheads. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient and secure federated learning (ESFL) technique to accelerate the detection of poisonous models in PPFL. First, to improve computational efficiency, we construct a lightweight non-interactive efficient decryption functional encryption (NED-FE) scheme to protect the data privacy of local models. Then, to ensure high communication performance, we elaborately design a non-interactive privacy-preserving robust aggregation strategy, which efficiently detects the blind poisonous models and aggregates benign models. Finally, we implement ESFL and conduct extensive theoretical analysis and experiments. The numerical results demonstrate that ESFL not only achieves the confidentiality and robustness design goals but also maintains high efficiency. Compared with the baseline, ESFL effectively reduces the aggregation latency by up to 88%.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without raw data exchange. Prior studies on FL mainly focus on optimizing learning performance, enhancing privacy preservation, and improving attack resilience. However, little work studies how to mitigate the unfairness of federated trained models while unfair models would make discriminatory decisions toward certain groups or populations (e.g., favoring males over females), leading to serious ethical concerns. Thus, it is crucial to mitigate model unfairness in FL, yet challenging as this requires centralized access to each data point's fairness-sensitive information (e.g., race, gender), which is prohibited in FL. In this work, we propose a novel fair FL framework FedUFA, where the server can aggregate clients’ learned knowledge in an unbiased manner, to obtain fair and high-usability federated trained models. Specifically, to unearth the bias in clients’ local data and account for potentially heterogeneous local models, we propose a knowledge distillation-based FL scheme, where clients’ knowledge of learned features on a public dataset is amalgamated to the server for aggregation. We train an unbiased feature mapper at the server to remove fairness-sensitive latent features and extract fair representations from clients’ submitted raw features. In particular, we design an adversarial training method to train the mapper, which involves a predictor aiming to maximize the prediction accuracy on the FL task and a discriminator intending to help identify fairness-sensitive features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedUFA.}

	abstract = {Isolation technology is often used to reduce the impact of cyber attacks, and it is mainly used in multi-user environments. Representative examples of said technology include access-control mechanisms and virtual machines. In a single-user environment, virtual addressing and a trusted execution environment isolate applications. However, the focus of such techniques is usually only on isolation, while the sharing of files has not been given much attention. In a single-user environment, users have the ability to access the same file through multiple applications. In this paper, we introduce the concept of file view, and propose file isolation based on the notion of views. Under the proposed MultiFile View mechanism, files within a view can be accessed by multiple applications when that particular view is activated. In other words, files appear only if their associated view is activated. The proposed technique is effective in protecting files from attacks on user data files, such as ransomware, wiper, and evil maid attacks. We also develop three models to describe how to assign views to applications. The proposed technique is prototyped in Windows 10. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the new technique’s performance overhead does not noticeably affect the overall user experience.}

	abstract = {Defending Edge intelligence-based Internet of Things (EIoT) systems by controlling malware propagation has become a critical issue. Herein, we meet new challenges brought by multiple attackers and defenders for effective mitigation of malware propagation in EIoT. To explore the dynamic changes of malware propagation, a state transition diagram of IoT nodes is proposed to describe the mutual changes of five states: infected, active, dormant, isolated, and hardened, and differential equations for each state are established. We then build a mean-field game model representing the interactions between multiattackers and multidefenders in the EIoT malware propagation defense environment. We further convert the problem of solving the game into an MDP (Markov Decision Process) and propose a distributed algorithm called MFGA3C (Mean-Field Game-based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) that combines mean-field game and multiagent asynchronous advantage actor-critic to learn the optimal defense policy. Finally, we compare our algorithm MFGA3C with other benchmark algorithms in the EIoT malware propagation countermeasure environment. Experimental results show that our MFGA3C algorithm dominates the average reward, total reward, and the number of successful defenses under three typical EIoT-environmental conditions, which indicates that MFGA3C faster and more robustly learns the optimal malware propagation defense policy, contributing to protecting EIoT systems.}

	abstract = {The Payment Channel Network (PCN) stands out as one of the most promising technologies for scaling blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. However, a noteworthy challenge arises during the utilization of PCNs, where a substantial portion of payment channels gradually becomes exhausted, leading to a reduction in the overall availability of PCNs. This issue is crucial in the context of blockchain off-chain PCNs and warrants a comprehensive investigation. In this paper, we introduce the problem of optimal recover and propose OPtimal REcovering protocols, denoted as OPRE and OPRE+, to address this challenge. The protocols target at recovering the optimal number of nearly exhausted channels in the PCN. OPRE provides a basic solution, and OPRE+ is an augmentation which provides a more efficient and effective solution. Furthermore, to address users’ privacy concerns, we propose privacy-preserving versions of the protocols, ensuring that users’ balance on payment channels remains undisclosed during the execution of the protocols. Beyond the theoretical design and analysis, we implement these protocols and conduct experimental evaluations to assess their performance. The results affirm that our protocols exhibit efficiency and effectiveness in significantly improving the availability of PCNs.}

	abstract = {Manufacturers offer adjustable control parameters for flight control systems to accommodate diverse environments and missions. To ensure flight safety, they also develop established boundaries, i.e., range specifications for parameter values. However, even when the configuration parameters fall within the prescribed manufacturer range, they could still lead to instability or even severe incidents like crashes, which are referred to as Range Specification Bugs. Prior research has suggested shrinking the range of parameter values to protect drones from the adverse effects of such bugs. However, narrowing the range of parameters may only reduce the probability of errors and could potentially limit the drone’s adaptability. To overcome this limitation, we present an online approach that analyzes a sequence of flight states to detect any potential triggering of bugs and rectify the drone by dynamically adjusting its parameters. We implemented the rectification approach, ConFix, and applied it in current prevalent flight control systems, Ardupilot and PX4. The results demonstrated that ConFix achieved an average rectification success rate of 80%.}

	abstract = {Cross-silo federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing training data, but privacy in FL remains a major challenge. Techniques using homomorphic encryption (HE) have been designed to solve this but bring their own challenges. Many techniques using single-key HE (SKHE) require clients to fully trust each other to prevent privacy disclosure between clients. However, fully trusted clients are hard to ensure in practice. Other techniques using multi-key HE (MKHE) aim to protect privacy from untrusted clients but lead to the disclosure of training results in public channels by untrusted third parties, e.g., the public cloud server. Besides, MKHE has higher computation and communication complexity compared with SKHE. We present a new FL protocol ESAFL that leverages a novel efficient and secure additively HE (ESHE) based on the hard problem of ring learning with errors. ESAFL can ensure the security of training data between untrusted clients and protect the training results against untrusted third parties. In addition, theoretical analyses present that ESAFL outperforms current techniques using MKHE in computation and communication, and intensive experiments show that ESAFL achieves approximate  204\\times 204\\times − 953\\times 953\\times  and  11\\times 11\\times − 14\\times 14\\times  training speedup while reducing the communication burden by  77\\times 77\\times − 109\\times 109\\times  and  1.25\\times 1.25\\times − 2\\times 2\\times  compared with the state-of-the-art FL models using SKHE.}

MTDs claim to increase the difficulty for the attacker in conducting attacks by regularly changing certain elements of the defense, such as cycling through configurations. To examine these claims, we study for the first time the effectiveness of several recent MTDs for adversarial ML attacks applied to the malware detection domain. Under different threat models, we show that novel transferability and query attack strategies can increase the evasion rate by 50+% against these defenses across Android and Windows, with 90+% evasion rate in some cases. We also show that fingerprinting and reconnaissance are possible and demonstrate how attackers may obtain critical defense hyperparameters as well as information about how predictions are produced. Based on our findings, we present key recommendations for future work on the development of effective MTDs for adversarial attacks in ML-based malware detection.}

	abstract = {As cloud storage becomes popular, more and more users tend to outsource their data to powerful cloud severs. To prevent a single point of failure, users prefer to store data on multiple cloud servers from different cloud service providers. However, after outsourcing data to cloud servers, users lose the control of their data, which may incur many serious security issues, such as abnormal data tampering and deleting. It is necessary for users to audit multiple cloud storage aperiodically. In this article, we aim to design a decentralized self-auditing solution for multiple cloud storage, in which cloud servers can audit the integrity of each other, and thus no third-party entity is required. First, based on basic algebra, our protocol realizes decentralized self-auditing multiple cloud storage that only involves encrypted user data. Second, we design a proof exchanging mechanism, making any number of cloud servers form the same final integrity proof with a linear number of interactions. Third, our solution can achieve cloud dynamics, which can freely enable and disable a cloud server to provide storage service. At last, security proof and performance evaluation show that the proposed protocol has provable security and high efficiency.}

	abstract = {Machine unlearning allows data owners to erase the impact of their specified data from trained models. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that adversaries can recover the erased data, posing serious threats to user privacy. An effective unlearning method removes the information of the specified data from the trained model, resulting in different outputs for the same input before and after unlearning. Adversaries can exploit these output differences to conduct privacy leakage attacks, such as reconstruction and membership inference attacks. However, directly applying traditional defenses to unlearning leads to significant model utility degradation. In this article, we introduce a Compressive Representation Forgetting Unlearning scheme (CRFU), designed to safeguard against privacy leakage on unlearning. CRFU achieves data erasure by minimizing the mutual information between the trained compressive representation (learned through information bottleneck theory) and the erased data, thereby maximizing the distortion of data. This ensures that the model's output contains less information that adversaries can exploit. Furthermore, we introduce a remembering constraint and an unlearning rate to balance the forgetting of erased data with the preservation of previously learned knowledge, thereby reducing accuracy degradation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRFU can effectively defend against privacy leakage attacks. Our experimental results show that CRFU significantly increases the reconstruction mean square error (MSE), achieving a defense effect improvement of approximately 200% against privacy reconstruction attacks with only 1.5% accuracy degradation on MNIST.}

	abstract = {To solve the problem of blockchain interoperability, we propose an efficient decentralization oracle solution. We design a subgroup Schnorr multisignature for the off-chain aggregation mechanism of our system, which is proven to be secure and robust. Compared with threshold signature-based schemes, the subgroup multisignature-based scheme does not require the execution of the distributed key generation protocol, which greatly reduces off-chain costs. The on-chain verification of the Schnorr signature is also more efficient than the pairing-based signatures. Then, we design a fair incentive mechanism to encourage the oracle nodes to work hard to validate the external data, which is based on a repeated dynamic game. Compared with the existing incentive mechanisms, our mechanism considers the real actions of each node to determine whether it should be rewarded or penalized. We implement our system over the Ethereum blockchain, and the experiments show its good performance.}

	abstract = {Recently, Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images with Multiple Hiders (RDHEI-MH) has attracted the attention of researchers, as it can satisfy the requirements of multiparty embedding. In this paper, a universal framework for RDHEI-MH is proposed, in which most of existing RDH algorithms in the plaintext domain (including Data Expansion (DE)-based and Histogram Shifting (HS)-based algorithms) can be applied in encrypted images without performance loss. That cannot be achieved by current existing schemes. The framework contains three entities: image owner, multiple hiders, and image receiver. The cover image is shared by Additive Secret Sharing (ASS) at the image owner’s side, and then each image share is sent to the corresponding hider. Based on the Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols specially designed for RDH operations, the hiders can securely perform computation on shares to embed additional data. After receiving all the marked image shares, the image receiver can reconstruct the marked image, and further extract the data. Compared with the previous RDHEI-MH schemes, the proposed scheme achieves full-separability, i.e., the extraction and decryption operations are commutative. The experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high visual quality of the reconstructed image and high embedding capacity, while its security is proved.}

	abstract = {To motivate data owners’ (DOs’) trading willingness, the existing incentive mechanisms allow DOs to independently disturb data following data consumer's (DC’s) availability requirement. However, they cannot motivate DOs’ honest disturbance, which is attributed to DOs’ independent disturbance without any supervision. Thus, we implement an incentive mechanism for privacy preserved data trading with verifiable data disturbance where an honest-but-curious disturbance generator (DG) is additionally introduced to supervise DOs’ local disturbance and assist disturbance verification between DOs and DC. Specifically, DG generates the disturbance strategies and secretly distributes to DOs following private information retrieval, guaranteeing DOs's local disturbance's privacy and verifiability with our proposed three-level verification algorithm. Subsequently, we model the trading as a game and disturbance verification results determine the compensation and punishment for trading bilateral utilities following Nash Equilibrium where DOs honestly disturb data. Theoretical analysis shows that DOs are motivated to honestly disturb data and their raw data privacy is preserved. Extensive experiments using the real-world dataset demonstrate that the deviating DOs in our scheme can be verified with a probability of more than 90% and the statistical result accuracy can be improved by more than 80% compared with the existing works.}

	abstract = {Ensuring scalability in cryptocurrency systems is significant in guaranteeing real-world utility along with the remarkable increment of cryptographic currency. As an alternative in solving scalability issue, payment channel allows users to deliver extensive offline transactions without uploading massive transaction details to the blockchain, such that increasing efficiency can be achieved. However, the implementation of payment channel still encounters privacy concerns when considering the publicly available transaction amounts and the potentials in mining associations between transaction parties. In this paper, we propose a novel payment channel scheme, entitled Commitment-based Anonymous Payment ChannEl (CAPE), to facilitate unlimited off-chain bidirectional payments while guaranteeing participants’ privacy. The proposed scheme adopts zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) and verifiable timed (VTD) commitments to ensure the anonymity of the relationship between on-chain and off-chain transactions, privacy of transaction amounts, and security of balances. We comprehensively formalize security definitions and present rigorous proofs for each security attribute. Experiment results further demonstrate the practical viability of CAPE.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to jointly train global models by exchanging local gradients instead of raw local datasets. However, poisoning attacks have emerged as a severe threat to FL security, where malicious clients submit crafted gradients to compromise the integrity and availability of the model. Although researchers have worked on countering these attacks to achieve Byzantine-robust FL, it remains challenging to balance high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency simultaneously. We propose FLAD, a novel Byzantine-robust FL approach based on gradient feature anomaly detection, which is the first approach that uses neural networks to adaptively learn gradient features and measure feature similarity to counteract various types of poisoning attacks. Specifically, FLAD employs a small clean dataset to bootstrap trust and trains Feature Extraction Models (FEM). With FEM and DBSCAN clustering, abnormal gradients from malicious clients are detected and eliminated. Extensive experiments on both Non-IID and IID datasets demonstrate that FLAD achieves superior accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we implement privacy-preserving FLAD (PFLAD) using CKKS and Random Permutation techniques to ensure transmitted gradient privacy.}

	abstract = {A recently proposed 3D object encryption scheme enables hierarchical decryption, allowing a single encryption to display varied visual effects upon decryption. This has potential applications in complex scenarios where 3D objects require access at different security levels. However, it has two main issues: lossless decryption is not possible due to precision loss from the IEEE 754 standard, and it is customized for a specific AES algorithm, limiting support for others. Motivated by this, a novel paradigm for 3D object encryption with differentiated visual effects upon decryption is proposed. In this paradigm, the precision loss is preserved within the 3D encrypted object, allowing the 3D object after fully decrypting to be identical to the original, and thus it is lossless. Meanwhile, the data to be encrypted is reduced to three blocks, which are generalized bitstreams. Bitstream encryption algorithms that do not produce ciphertext expansion can be applied, and it operates independently of the other components in the paradigm, making it universal. Finally, a prototype of this paradigm is constructed, using the same encryption algorithm as in the previous scheme for comparative experiments. Two 3D object datasets are used to conduct the experiments and results demonstrate that it achieves lossless decryption and has a time advantage, while also undergoing security analysis and verification against smoothing attacks to confirm the security.}

Intuitively, data points that MIA accurately detects are vulnerable. Those data points may exist in the data of different target models, each susceptible to multiple MIAs. As such, the vulnerability of data points under multiple MIAs and target models represents a significant challenge. This article defines several metrics reflecting data points’ vulnerability and capturing vulnerable data points under multiple MIAs and target models. We implement 77 MIAs, with an average attack accuracy over target models ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, to support our analysis with our scalable and flexible platform, Various Membership Inference Attacks Platform (VMIAP). Based on the results, we observe that MIA has an inference tendency to some data points despite a low overall inference performance. Furthermore, previous approaches are unsuitable for finding vulnerable data points under multiple MIAs and target models. Finally, we explore the impact of retraining target, shadow, and attack models separately on the vulnerability of data points.}

It has intriguing prospects, especially for boosting machine learning on large-scale data, which are tangled with sparse data. In this paper, we investigate privacy-preserving SIP problems that have rarely been explored before. Specifically, we propose two concrete constructions, one requiring offline linear communication, which can be amortized across queries, while the other has sublinear overhead but relies on the more computationally expensive tool. Our approach exploits state-of-the-art cryptography tools including garbled Bloom filters (GBF) and Private Information Retrieval (PIR) as the cornerstone but carefully fuses them to obtain nontrivial overhead reductions. We provide formal security analysis of the proposed constructions and implement them into representative machine learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes classification, and logistic regression.

	abstract = {Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern triggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph characteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above issues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable Constraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For graph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the graph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph and modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature range, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an analysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger features, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and feature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success rate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for attack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal clean accuracy drop (CAD). When combined with the state-of-the-art defense randomized smoothing (RS) method, our attack maintains an ASR over 94%, surpassing existing attacks by more than 7%.}

	abstract = {The sharing of Internet of Things (IoT) data plays an extensive role in our everyday lives. Exploring secure and efficient methods for data sharing is a prominent area of research. Proxy re-encryption (PRE) in the cloud provides a solution. However, traditional PRE schemes are vulnerable to algorithm substitution attacks (ASA). Moreover, in most PRE schemes, the proxy can know the relevant identity information of the data owner or the data recipient through the re-encryption key, and some current PRE schemes cannot guarantee strong resistance to collision. To address the limitations of traditional PRE schemes and offer a robust solution for secure and efficient data sharing in IoT application, we propose a reverse firewall for proxy re-encryption (PRE-RF) scheme, which is implemented by JPBC library. Security analysis shows that our PRE-RF scheme provides effective resistance to ASA, along with strong collision security, chosen plaintext attack security, and key-private security. Compared with similar state-of-the-art PRE schemes, our scheme reduces the length of the re-encryption keys and ciphertext, thereby reducing the storage cost of the system. Meanwhile, our scheme’s computational cost is lower, thereby improving the operational efficiency of the system. Furthermore, the amount of time devoted to the reverse firewall in our scheme decreases as security level increases. As a result, these advantages make it a secure and efficient choice for sharing IoT data in unreliable cloud environments.}

This oversight makes it challenging to balance privacy and utility effectively. To address this issue, we introduce the Privacy Evaluation and Validation scheme to Measure the original Privacy Degree (PEVMPD), anchored in a novel  \\eta \\eta -inference model. PEVMPD operates in two phases: the identification of risk elements and the evaluation of privacy degrees. In the first phase, attributes are appraised using entropy and KL divergence to pinpoint sensitive attributes. Concurrently, the maximum entropy principle is employed to identify critical quasi-identifiers. The second phase involves applying these risk elements within our  \\eta \\eta -inference model to locate data vulnerable to privacy breaches and to quantify the corresponding privacy degree. This methodology enables data owners to make informed decisions about achieving an optimal privacy-utility tradeoff during data anonymization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness of PEVMPD in enhancing privacy measures.}

	abstract = {Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) enables querying over encrypted data stored on servers, protecting the privacy of both client queries and the data. However, the response results of the query can leak certain statistical information, allowing an active attacker to inject files and exploit these leakages to recover the queried keyword. Recently, Zhang et al. (USENIX Security 2023) proposed a volumetric injection attack, called BVMA, based on response volume patterns. This attack requires larger file injections and has a moderate recovery rate. In this work, we propose a powerful volumetric injection attack,  \\mathsf {Violin} \\mathsf {Violin} , that utilizes response length and size patterns, achieving a higher recovery rate and smaller injection size. Specifically,  \\mathsf {Violin} \\mathsf {Violin}  requires  \\mathcal {O}(\\log n) \\mathcal {O}(\\log n)  injection files with a total size of  \\mathcal {O}(n\\log n) \\mathcal {O}(n\\log n) , where  n n  is the number of keywords. Furthermore, we propose a file injection method with optimal injection amount (i.e., injected files number and size) based on Pascal’s triangle rule under threshold countermeasure. We implement  \\mathsf {Violin} \\mathsf {Violin}  and compare it with the existing injection attacks. Experimental results indicate that  \\mathsf {Violin} \\mathsf {Violin}  achieves a recovery rate approaching 100%, surpassing the state-of-the-art BVMA while requiring smaller file sizes. Under threshold countermeasure,  \\mathsf {Violin} \\mathsf {Violin}  achieves a saving of 22% in injection file size and a remarkable 95% decrease in injected file number compared to BVMA.}

	abstract = {Biometric identification involves using person recognition techniques to extract physical or biological traits. These traits make it possible to characterize and differentiate one person from another and provide crucial and irreplaceable information. Biometric identification based on EEG signals has recently become very interesting because it cannot be falsified and provides proof of life in security applications. An EEG-based biometric system is a complex one from which the defining characteristics of each person are extracted. Still, it is not free of uncertainties and impressions inherent to the measurement technique itself. This paper explores the potential of using a classification based on fuzzy logic in conjunction with a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The methodology was tested with two databases of 13 and 109 subjects, with results showing that this methodology allows high accuracy ratios of 99%. The study provides evidence of the potential of this approach for practical applications in biometric identification.}

	abstract = {The increasing demand for secure and efficient data sharing has underscored the importance of developing robust cryptographic schemes. However, many existing endeavors have overlooked the following critical issues: (1) unauthorized access resulting from malicious information leakage by senders; (2) absence of constraints on write and read permissions for participants; (3) and inflexibility of strategies to dynamically designate ciphertexts to multiple recipients. In this paper, we present SCPA, a cross-domain access control scheme imbued with sanitization features and propelled by policy-driven dynamic authorization, tailored for cloud-based data sharing. This scheme not only facilitates access controls, including regulations for no-read and no-write stipulations, governing the data permissible for senders to transmit and recipients to acquire but also enables the dynamic sharing of a data ciphertext subset with additional recipients beyond the originally sanctioned ones. We also provide comprehensive security proofs rigorously indicating the security of the invented SCPA. Moreover, to assess the efficacy of our SCPA, we undertake thorough theoretical and experimental analyses, showcasing its feasibility and superior performance.}

	abstract = {The increasing sharing of images on social networks is prompting the involvement of digital watermarking to protect copyright and combat illegal redistribution. Owner-side embedding and client-side embedding are two modes of digital watermarking, among which the latter enables better system scalability than the former due to its higher owner-side efficiency. However, the existing client-side watermarking schemes do not take into account the preview needs of users, in which users are prevented from acquiring any visual information about the original image before decryption because it is encrypted to be fully blurred. As a result, users cannot select the desired one by previewing when a batch of encrypted images is given. To solve this problem, we overcome the incompatibility between techniques and innovatively combine client-side watermarking with thumbnail-preserving encryption to render the degraded visual perception of the original image onto the encrypted one. Specifically, the image is first fully encrypted as usual client-side watermarking, and then pixel adjustments are performed to approximate the sum of the original pixels in each block for rendering the degraded visual perception. In this way, two schemes with different performance emphasis are proposed, which implement watermark embedding based on spread spectrum and quantization index modulation separately. In terms of performance evaluation, the security of both schemes is thoroughly demonstrated, and experiments are conducted to assess their feasibility, robustness, and efficiency.}

Unfortunately, the mobile sector has recently fallen prey to a series of ransomware campaigns designed to lock users out of their devices and extort them for payment. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel runtime system that dynamically restores device access by undoing the effects of locker ransomware. A key observation made by this work is that attackers rely on the display of a ransom note on the victim’s device to demand payment. Based on this observation, we develop a solution that combines the monitoring of mobile app activity with a natural language processing (NLP) unit that harnesses transformers to detect the appearance of ransom notes. We extensively validate the robustness of our solution against more than five thousand ransomware samples and show that our solution reliably recovers from all the malicious samples that we tested, including overlay screen and change pin-code ransomware. Finally, an evaluation of our proof-of-concept implementation shows minimal performance impact while running a mix of mobile benchmark applications.}

	abstract = {Recent studies emphasize the serious threat posed by backdoor attacks when training deep models on data from untrustworthy sources. Despite the emergence of various backdoor attack paradigms, the patch-based approach stands out as the most sought-after and effective method of poisoning. However, current defenses against such attacks often exhibit rudimentary and highly inefficient, sometimes necessitating days for implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a swift and efficient defense against patch-based backdoor attacks, called S-teapot. S-teapot rapidly identifies whether an untrusted dataset has been backdoored and determines the backdoored labels based on the model's high confidence in the poisoning sample and the consistency of the backdoor pixels. S-teapot outperforms existing backdoor attack detection schemes by a speedup factor ranging from 30 to 259. Furthermore, we leverage the abnormality of the backdoor pixels to reverse the backdoor trigger, resulting in a similarity increase of 0.6 to 32 times compared to existing methods. To obtain a clean model, S-teapot accurately localizes poisoning samples through similarity calculations, with nearly 100% precision. Leveraging the precision of the reverse triggers, S-teapot employs an inpaint method to convert the poisoning samples into clean ones, yielding up to 8.16% improvement in accuracy.}

	abstract = {Due to limited computational and storage capabilities, wireless medical sensor networks (WMSN) encounter considerable overhead in processing the storage and verification of numerous signatures. Multi-signatures allow a group of signers to produce a single, compact signature on the same message, significantly reducing storage requirements and communication bandwidth in WMSN. However, conventional multi-signature schemes are not quantum resistant, as their security assumptions will be compromised with the quick advancement in quantum computing. Alternatively, lattice-based cryptography is widely considered capable of withstanding quantum computing attacks. In this article, we introduce a quantum-resistant and non-interactive identity-based multi-signature scheme from lattices with public key aggregation (IBMS-pka). By leveraging the small integer solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme is proven secure within the random oracle model. Besides, our scheme enables users to choose their system identities (e.g., physical IP address or email address) as public keys compared to PKI-based schemes, and avoids the extra communication costs in contrast to interactive schemes. Meanwhile, our scheme outperforms other related works according to our experiments. Specifically, the multi-signature generation has a slightly higher efficiency compared to other related schemes, while the multi-signature verification has a larger enhancement. Moreover, the performance improvement becomes more evident as the number of signers grows.}

Thus, it has become an important tool to harden the networking infrastructure and the computing systems built on top. Substantial advancements have been made in the last decade and state-of-the-art DPV systems can achieve sub- \\mu \\mu s verification for an update of a single forwarding rule. In this article, we introduce fast inverse model transformation (FIMT), the first theoretical framework to systematically model and analyze centralized DPV systems. FIMT reveals the algebraic structure in the model update process, a key step in fast DPV systems. Thus, it can systematically analyze the correctness of several DPV systems and optimization techniques, using algebraic properties. The theory also guides the design and implementation of Uimt, a generic DPV framework with provable optimization techniques. Using Uimt, we create two variants of existing DPV systems, NeoFlash and NeoDeltaNet. Evaluations show that NeoFlash outperforms existing state-of-the-art centralized DPV systems in various datasets and reveal insights to key techniques towards fast DPV.}

However, a lack of adequate security in IoT devices renders IoT systems vulnerable to various network-based cyberattacks, potentially causing severe damage. Recent works have explored using machine learning to build anomaly detection models for defending against such attacks. In this paper, we propose FeCo, a federated-contrastive-learning framework that coordinates in-network IoT devices to jointly learn intrusion detection models. FeCo utilizes federated learning to alleviate users’ privacy concerns as participating devices only submit their model parameters rather than raw local data. Compared to previous works, we develop a novel representation learning method based on contrastive learning that is able to learn a more accurate model for the benign class. FeCo significantly improves the intrusion detection accuracy compared to previous works. In addition, we implement a two-step feature selection scheme to avoid overfitting and reduce computation time. Through extensive experiments on the NSL-KDD dataset and the BaIoT dataset, we demonstrate that FeCo achieves as high as 8% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art and is robust to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Our implementation of FeCo on a Raspberry Pi device further confirms the applicability of FeCo for resource-constrained IoT devices.}

	abstract = {Video steganography that conceals secret data into motion vectors (MVs) is a popular covert communication technique. The local optimality of MVs is an intrinsic property in video coding, and any modifications to the MVs will inevitably destroy this optimality, making it a sensitive indicator of steganography. Thus the local optimality is commonly used to design features in video steganalysis. However, the local optimality in existing works is often estimated inaccurately or by using an unreasonable assumption, limiting its capability in steganalysis. In this article, we propose to estimate the local optimality in a more reasonable and comprehensive fashion, and generalize the local optimality in two aspects. First, we generalize the local optimality from a static estimation to a dynamic one by considering the variability of predicted motion vectors (PMVs). Second, we generalize the local optimality from MV domain to PMV domain by leveraging the statistical anomaly of PMVs. Based on the two generalizations that ensure a more accurate estimation of local optimality from more views, we construct new types of steganalytic features and also propose feature symmetrization rules to reduce feature dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed features, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness under various conditions.}

The main contribution lies in designing a divide-and-conquer strategy that utilizes VMI and network programmability to apply focused distributed task and packet probing mechanisms on portions of the data center network rather than focusing the security functions on the entire physical network. The processing VMs and network switches are recursively partitioned into independent logical groups inspected individually to localize abnormal/malicious computing and switching nodes incrementally. This remarkably enhances the efficiency of the detection mechanisms, which opportunistically approaches a logarithmic time complexity in the number of protocol steps towards convergence (compared to a linear time complexity in traditional intrusion detection systems) when a relatively low number of hostile VMs and switches are present. Real experiments are evaluated, and a test-bed blueprint of the proposed design is emulated in a virtualized cloud environment using the Mininet emulator. The performance, convergence, and accuracy benchmarks corroborate the analytical advantage of the proposed security approach.}

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is an important part of industrial infrastructure but facing serious and evolving security threats in recent years. Deep learning has been widely considered as a promising solution for enhancing the security of IIoT. However, these existing deep learning models utilized in the intrusion detection of IIoT are manually developed that not only greatly rely on the experience of the designers but also is lack of utility due to the high model complexity. By taking into account the trade-off between the model performance and model complexity, this article makes the first attempt to propose a multi-objective joint optimization method of neural architecture search (NAS) and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) based on multi-objective discrete extremal optimization (MODEO) to automatically design a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for the intrusion detection task of IIoT, abbreviated as MODEO-CNN. A novel hybrid variable-length encoding strategy is developed by combing binary and integer encoding to characterize both the neural architectures including the number of blocks, the blocks-based network topology and the corresponding architecture parameters in CNN block, and some important hyper-parameters including batch size, learning rate, weight optimizer and regularization. The individual-based discrete multi-objective evolutionary process of MODEO is designed to obtain the Pareto-optimal CNN models. Three widely-used IIoT intrusion detection datasets, including the Gas Pipeline, BoT-IoT, and Power System Attack datasets, have been used to illustrate the superiority of the proposed MODEO-CNN over the state-of-the-art hand-craft models and two single-objective fixed-length blocks-based NAS models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,  F_{1} F 1 F_{1} -Score, and model's million floating point operations.}

	abstract = {Mobile users often prefer to sense only a subset of tasks based on their preferences or physical conditions, which distinguishes sparse crowdsensing from traditional crowdsensing. Sparse crowdsensing not only introduces a potential risk of privacy leakage regarding users’ preferences or conditions—due to the revelation of specific sensed objects—but also results in reduced accuracy of truth estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Truth Discovery (PPTD) scheme, named S-PPTD, that enables accurate and efficient PPTD for sparse crowdsensing. Our approach leverages edge nodes to geographically group users and introduces an effective padding strategy based on Bloom filters and mixed secret sharing. This strategy allows users to obfuscate the objects they sense, preventing adversaries from determining the specific objects being sensed. To improve accuracy, we design new protocols for precise and efficient approximation of nonlinear functions, enabling the use of commonly applied kernel functions to capture spatial and temporal correlations between objects, and incorporate these into the truth estimation process. Through extensive experiments and security analysis, we demonstrate that S-PPTD is secure, accurate, and efficient in the context of sparse mobile crowdsensing.}

	abstract = {Source localization based on snapshot observations has gained popularity owing to its low cost and accessibility. However, current methods do not adequately address the impact of user interaction in time-varying infection scenarios, leading to reduced accuracy in heterogeneous interaction environments. To address these issues and ensure transferability and applicability in different scenarios, this paper proposes an inductive localization framework based on sequence-to-sequence architecture, named Feature-representation-based Graph Sequential Source Identification (FGSSI). Particularly, FGSSI employs a user-feature-construction-based encoder to construct low-dimensional embeddings of each individual by evaluating their dynamic and static behavioral attributes at different timestamps. Additionally, FGSSI uses a graph-GRU based decoder with temporal attention to infer the source by incorporating graph topology information into the sequential model and handling imbalanced infection information under temporal characteristics. It is worth mentioning that FGSSI can detect sources in new scenarios without prior knowledge owing to the proposed inductive learning approach. Comprehensive experiments using SOTA methods demonstrate FGSSI's superior detection performance and transferability.}

	abstract = {Phishing URL detection has become a critical challenge in cybersecurity, with existing methods often struggling to maintain high accuracy while generalizing across diverse datasets. In this article, we introduce BERT-PhishFinder, a novel and efficient transformer-based model designed to tackle this problem. While most traditional approaches rely heavily on lexical features or complex convolutional architectures, BERT-PhishFinder leverages the power of DistilBERT, a lightweight yet highly effective transformer, to capture rich contextual representations of URL sequences. To enhance the model’s robustness and reduce overfitting, we strategically incorporate SpatialDropout1D in the embedding layers, along with global average pooling and global max pooling techniques to extract both comprehensive and key discriminative features. The pooled representations are thoughtfully concatenated to form a comprehensive feature representation. Through this carefully crafted design, our model adopts ensemble learning, as it undergoes multiple parallel dense layers, each with distinct parameters and dropout regularization. This facilitates learning diverse patterns and features from the input URL sequence, culminating in exceptional phishing URL detection performance. Extensive evaluations against conventional deep learning algorithms, transformer models (XLNet, RoBERTa, ALBERT), and other existing methods on five benchmark datasets show that BERT-PhishFinder not only achieves the state of-the-art real phishing URL detection but also accomplishes this with reduced label dependency.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables training across multiple entities while ensuring data security and the effectiveness of knowledge dissemination. Despite its benefits, it remains susceptible to privacy breaches by both external and internal adversaries, who may exploit data or model parameters to glean sensitive participant information or disrupt the training process, thus compromising participant privacy and security. This paper proposes a novel methodology, Adversarial Samples for Defense Inference Attack (ASDIA), aimed at dual protection of data privacy and model robustness within federated learning through adversarial samples and gradient reconstruction. ASDIA includes gradient processing approach before uploading: initially identifying privacy-sensitive gradient, followed by the injection of well-calibrated noise to these gradients. This method not only obfuscates the adversary's classification demarcations but also aids in model performance recovery, all the while maintaining computational efficiency. ASDIA reduces the efficacy of attacks to near-random guessing levels and shows better balance between the model utility and privacy protection compared to the most advanced defense strategies. Additionally, regarding model performance, ASDIA proves its merit across diverse datasets under overfitting and non-overfitting scenarios.}

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models have shown promise in detecting adversarial examples for classifiers by leveraging their ability to reconstruct benign and adversarial examples differently. However, existing approaches often struggle with reconstruction optimization convergence for adversarial examples, as GANs cannot perfectly reconstruct such inputs. To address this instability, we propose two novel methods: Average-RAED and Strict-RAED. Average-RAED focuses on the average reconstruction performance throughout the optimization process, with the difference in the classifier’s logit information between the candidate sample and its reconstructed version as the detection signal. This approach enhances robustness and effectiveness, particularly for complex datasets. Strict-RAED integrates classification information into the reconstruction process and imposes a strict constraint to keep the latent code within the initial latent subspace. This design enables Strict-RAED to effectively identify both manually-crafted and natural adversarial examples. We evaluated both methods in a grey-box scenario, where the adversary has full knowledge of the target classifier’s architecture and parameters but no information about the defense GAN. Our results demonstrate that both Average-RAED and Strict-RAED outperform baseline methods in distinguishing adversarial examples from benign samples. Notably, Strict-RAED achieves higher detection rates for both manually-crafted and natural adversarial examples. Furthermore, combining Strict-RAED for detection and Average-RAED for reforming candidate samples significantly improves classifier accuracy against less significant adversarial examples.}

	abstract = {Although consortium blockchain has an identification mechanism, the captured internal clients are potentially threatening internal blockchain nodes. Internal Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks threaten the specific nodes in consortium blockchain, e.g., the executor, consensus, and committer nodes. Typical attack methods may include SYN Flooding and ACK Flooding and deny normal transaction service by sending many invalid transactions and blocks. In this work, we have proposed an organization collaboration-based DDoS defense approach and a Deep Q-learning (DQN)-based Moving Target Defense (MTD) for changing attack surface of victims in consortium blockchain. On one hand, contracts are used to synchronize attack information obtained from organizations, e.g., bots’ IP addresses and public keys. On the other hand, we have developed a DQN-based MTD defense mechanism for organizations to change the attack surface of victims in order to mitigate the malicious traffic, in the case of missing detections of bots. Our approach applies a multi-stage game to reflect interactions between attackers and defenders. The evaluation results have demonstrated that our approach could effectively mitigate DDoS attacks in consortium blockchain.}

	abstract = {Centralized trading platforms have long been the preferred choice for users, despite growing concerns regarding data privacy. Users have to place their trust in these platforms and provide sensitive personal information, like identities and financial accounts. However, these centralized platforms often lack transparency, making it challenging to ensure fairness, privacy, and security against both external and internal risks. In contrast, a decentralized fair trading paradigm, harnessing the potential of blockchain technology, is rapidly emerging. It empowers individuals to engage in the exchange of digital assets with others while guaranteeing fairness, efficiency, and privacy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of decentralized fair trading. We commence by providing fundamental definitions of fair trading and tracing its evolution over time. We then delve into the essential framework of on-chain and off-chain trading and highlight key improvements that enhance the efficiency of decentralized fair trading within various application scenarios. Furthermore, we undertake a thorough analysis of privacy and security enhancements within the scope, summarizing defenses against known attacks. Finally, we outline the challenges and offer insights into the future prospects of decentralized fair trading, with the aim of inspiring the development of more innovative and promising designs in this evolving trend.}

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Moving Target Defense (MTD) can enhance cybersecurity in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, the practicality of existing work is hindered by data privacy concerns associated with centralized data processing in RL, and the unsatisfactory time needed to learn right MTD techniques that are effective against a rising number of heterogeneous zero-day attacks. Thus, this work presents CyberForce, a framework that combines Federated and Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to collaboratively and privately learn suitable MTD techniques for mitigating zero-day attacks. CyberForce integrates device fingerprinting and anomaly detection to reward or penalize MTD mechanisms chosen by an FRL-based agent. The framework has been deployed and evaluated in a scenario consisting of ten physical devices of a real IoT platform affected by heterogeneous malware samples. A pool of experiments has demonstrated that CyberForce learns the MTD technique mitigating each attack faster than existing RL-based centralized approaches. In addition, when various devices are exposed to different attacks, CyberForce benefits from knowledge transfer, leading to enhanced performance and reduced learning time in comparison to recent works. Finally, different aggregation algorithms used during the agent learning process provide CyberForce with notable robustness to malicious attacks.}

Recent studies employ deep learning for similarity analysis to identify these vulnerabilities, yet their effectiveness wanes as the volume of analyzed code increases.

Leveraging a novel jump-aware Transformer-based model, our approach captures the semantics and control flow of bytecodes. It not only refines the representation of functions by integrating program analysis with natural language processing techniques but also innovates a contract-level similarity detection scheme tailored for the expansive scale of contracts.

Vulnerabilities recalling experiments show that SmartTrans achieves 95.43% and 99.37% accuracy at two levels. Furthermore, we stand out as the first work to retrieve N-day vulnerabilities across the Ethereum bytecode corpus, unveiling 4,988 vulnerable contracts. Our methodology secures an accuracy of 88.60%, which is 1.30 times higher than the best baseline.}

Surprisingly, semantic information in such passwords remain under-investigated, with passwords created by English- and/or Chinese-speaking users being more studied with limited semantics. This article fills this gap by proposing a general framework based on semantically enhanced PCFG (probabilistic context-free grammars) named SE#PCFG. It allowed us to consider 43 types of semantic information, the richest set considered so far, for password analysis. Applying SE#PCFG to 17 large leaked password databases of user speaking four languages (English, Chinese, German and French), we demonstrate its usefulness and report a wide range of new insights about password semantics at different levels such as cross-website password correlations. Furthermore, based on SE#PCFG and a new systematic smoothing method, we proposed the Semantically Enhanced Password Cracking Architecture (SEPCA), and compared its performance against three SOTA (state-of-the-art) benchmarks in terms of the password coverage rate: two other PCFG variants and neural network. Our experimental results showed that SEPCA outperformed all the three benchmarks consistently and significantly across 52 test cases, by up to 21.53%, 52.55% and 7.86%, respectively, at the user-level (with duplicate passwords). At the level of unique passwords, SEPCA also beats the three counterparts by up to 43.83%, 94.11% and 11.16%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently made significant strides in various fields; however, they are susceptible to adversarial examples—crafted inputs with imperceptible perturbations that can mislead these networks. Notably, even when adversaries lack access to the complete model parameters, they can still generate adversarial examples targeting a range of DNN-based task systems. Various defense mechanisms have been proposed, such as feature compression and gradient masking. Nevertheless, extensive research indicates that these methods often address only specific attacks, rendering them ineffective against novel and unknown attack strategies. Recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of identifying adversarial examples in the frequency domain; however, these approaches are limited to frequency-based analysis. In this study, we experimentally observe that adversarial examples possess significant characteristics in local regions. Specifically, adversarial perturbations exhibit localized randomness, whereas the high-frequency information in normal examples is both locally coherent and semantically relevant. This critical distinction enables effectively distinguishing adversarial examples from normal ones. To leverage this insight, we aim to enhance the high-frequency features of input examples to amplify their feature disparities. We propose an image enhancement method utilizing local histogram equalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method substantially improves detector performance without modifying the existing detection models. Furthermore, this technique can be seamlessly integrated with task models, effectively reducing deployment costs in practical applications.}

	abstract = {Log anomaly detection aims to discover abnormal events from massive log data to ensure the security and reliability of software systems. However, due to the heterogeneity of log formats and syntaxes across different systems, existing log anomaly detection methods often need to be designed and trained for specific systems, lacking generalization ability. To address this challenge, we propose LogDLR, a novel unsupervised cross-system log anomaly detection method. The core idea of LogDLR is to use universal sentence embeddings and a Transformer-based autoencoder to extract domain-invariant latent representations from log entries, which can effectively adapt to log format changes and capture semantic information and dependencies in log sequences. To obtain domain-invariant latent representations, we adopt a domain-adversarial training strategy, introducing a domain discriminator that competes with the Transformer-based encoder through a gradient reversal layer, forcing the encoder to learn shared knowledge between different system logs. Finally, the Transformer-based decoder detects anomalies based on the domain-invariant representations obtained by the encoder. We evaluate LogDLR in simulated cross-system scenarios using three publicly available log datasets. The experimental results show that LogDLR can handle heterogeneous logs effectively in cross-system scenarios and achieve efficient and accurate anomaly detection on both source and target systems.}

	abstract = {Transfer learning is an important approach that produces pre-trained teacher models which can be used to quickly build specialized student models. However, recent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not clear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Launching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is challenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters, but it is also not queried to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student model, existing model inversion attacks fail, as they typically rely on querying the target model. In this paper, we initiate research into model inversion attacks against transfer learning with two novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different situations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the first method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same distribution as the training set of the teacher model. In the second method, the adversary does not have any such samples. Experiments show that highly recognizable data records can be inverted with both of these methods. This research underscores the critical insight that even when a model is shielded from public queries, it can still be susceptible to model inversion attacks.}

	abstract = {Deep learning-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are capable of transcribing input audio of arbitrary duration into character sequences, which are widely used in daily life. However, recent research has found that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A malicious adversary can embed a backdoor functionality into the model during the training phase and manipulate the output of the backdoored model by adding a specific trigger to the input during the inference phase. Unfortunately, TrojanModel, the existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack against ASR systems (Zong et al. S&P’23), relies on an overly strong assumption that requires the adversary to modify the model structure beyond data poisoning, which significantly limits its practicability. In this paper, we propose CuckooAttack, a more practical backdoor attack against ASR systems that only requires poisoning a small portion of the training data. We first construct a phoneme-level auxiliary dataset to generate effective, robust, and unnoticeable triggers, while substantially lowering computational expenses. Considering the real-world ASR application scenarios, we propose an adaptive trigger injection mechanism to ensure that the backdoor can be activated on variable-duration input audio under asynchronous temporal conditions. To further enhance the efficacy of CuckooAttack, we design a character-filling strategy tailored for ASR to construct poisoned samples, which facilitates the model in establishing backdoor connections. Extensive experiments show that CuckooAttack achieves comparable performance with TrojanModel under a weaker assumption. Specifically, CuckooAttack achieves an attack success rate of about 99% in the digital domain and over 90% in the physical domain, with a poison rate of only 1%.}

	abstract = {Accurately spatio-temporal anomaly event inference is significant to enhance society’s safety, such as crime prevention and traffic collision reduction, etc. However, it is hard to achieve good performance for its complicated process being influenced by various kinds of factors. Previous works mainly focus on employing feature-based regression or fitting models with supposed spatio-temporal distribution to tackle this challenge, but are normally short of the following considerations: 1) mutual evolutionary influence, i.e., the dynamic evolution of interactions and dependencies among anomaly events, is changing along with the timeline and alters the probabilities or patterns of their occurrences dynamically; 2) messy features, i.e., complex attributes in the data but with noise, are difficult to select and aggregate for the representation learning algorithm with uncertainty and redundancy. To address the research gap, we put forward a co-evolutionary graph convolutional network model to explicate the dynamically spatio-temporal anomaly patterns. Specifically, we firstly take advantage of a fuzzy-rough set-based algorithm to select features by discovering the specialty and permanence attributes of different interaction features. Then, we propose a co-evolutionary learning method to embed the dynamically temporal influence into latent features with selected interaction information. Finally, we design a graph convolutional network with an attention mechanism to formulate the mutually spatial effects among the anomaly events. The proposed model is verified on the New York City crime records from the real-world, and extensive experiments show that our approach achieves 0.10129, 0.09958 and 0.10034 of the MAE (hour) in the action, location, and action-location time inference tasks, and 0.7973 and 0.4678 of the accuracy in the action and location type inference tasks, which outperform state-of-arts by 24.00%, 50.60%, 11.10%, 10.56% and 21.53% at most, respectively. Hyper-parameter and ablation experiments are also carried out further to demonstrate the sensitivity and effectiveness of our model.}

	abstract = {Network covert channels transmit secret messages by manipulating network traffic, including packet headers, timing intervals, and communication patterns. The growth of network services has spurred interest in exploring these channels. Yet, the practical application of these channels faces challenges in transmission rate and reliability due to unpredictable network interference. QUIC-based websites offer promising opportunities for covert communication, given their inherent dynamic nature from web resource updates and network interferences. Repeated visits or refresh actions on the same website generate substantial statistical redundancy. Furthermore, widely used proxy tools introduce additional traffic morphology changes. This paper presents QuicCourier, a covert channel leveraging web traffic's dynamic characteristics and proxy service encapsulation to hide messages in QUIC packets from the service node to the client. Guided by a generative model for web resource patterns, QuicCourier ensures that covert traffic closely resembles legitimate traffic, employing three packet-wise meta operations. The altered QUIC flows are then encased in proxy protocols, complicating the detection of embedded information. The covert receiver is incorporated into the proxy client. The efficacy of QuicCourier is evaluated using a dataset of over 30,000 web browsing traffic samples, demonstrating its exceptional undetectability against state-of-the-art traffic classification tools and a high covert transmission rate.}

	abstract = {Prediction queries have revolutionized data search by integrating machine learning models and traditional data processing operations for advanced analytics. However, existing prediction query frameworks for outsourced databases face a critical security vulnerability: data flows are processed in plaintext on semi-honest servers, making them susceptible to data breaches. The main challenge in achieving secure prediction queries is that machine learning inference and data processing operations are distinct functionalities, while most current cryptographic frameworks support only a single type of operation on specific encrypted data. To bridge this crucial gap, we propose  \\mathsf {SecPQ} \\mathsf {SecPQ} , the first framework tailored for secure prediction queries. Our approach unifies decision tree pipelines and data processing operations, such as selection, projection, and equality-joining, through equality matching on encrypted outsourced data. This enables the design of secure prediction queries with decision tree pipelines operating on encrypted data. We provide formal security definitions and proofs for  \\mathsf {SecPQ} \\mathsf {SecPQ} . To further optimize the efficiency of secure prediction queries, we leverage order-preserving encryption to construct  \\mathsf {SecPQ}_{{{ope}}} \\mathsf {SecPQ}_{{{ope}}} , which offers improved query efficiency at the expense of weaker security properties compared with  \\mathsf {SecPQ} \\mathsf {SecPQ} . Extensive experimental evaluations on billions of records demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of both  \\mathsf {SecPQ} \\mathsf {SecPQ}  and  \\mathsf {SecPQ}_{{{ope}}} \\mathsf {SecPQ}_{{{ope}}} .}

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor attacks arbitrarily set the trigger mask or use a randomly selected trigger, which restricts the effectiveness and robustness of the generated backdoor triggers. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based mask generation methodology that searches for the optimal trigger shape and location. We also introduce a Quality-of-Experience (QoE) term into the loss function and carefully adjust the transparency value of the trigger in order to make the backdoored samples to be more natural. To further improve the prediction accuracy of the victim model, we propose an alternating retraining algorithm in the backdoor injection process. The victim model is retrained with mixed poisoned datasets in even iterations and with only benign samples in odd iterations. Besides, we launch the backdoor attack under a co-optimized attack framework that alternately optimizes the backdoor trigger and backdoored model to further improve the attack performance. Apart from DNN models, we also extend our proposed attack method against vision transformers. We evaluate our proposed method with extensive experiments on VGG-Flower, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette datasets. It is shown that we can increase the attack success rate by as much as 82% over baselines when the poison ratio is low and achieve a high QoE of the backdoored samples. Our proposed backdoor attack framework also showcases robustness against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.}

	abstract = {Passwords are widely used for authentication in Internet applications. Recently, users tend to adopt graphical passwords instead of traditional alphanumeric passwords, since it is much easier for humans to remember images than verbal representations. However, the existing graphical password authentication systems generally suffer from three main issues. 1) It is required to remember and perform complicated operations during the registration/login phases, which significantly limits the systems’ usability; 2) The users’ passwords are simply stored as plaintexts in servers, and thus the security is compromised; 3) The users need to register/login to each server separately when they are applied in multi-server environment. To address the above issues, we propose a user-friendly and secure Google map-based graphical password (FS-GMGP) system using tolerant distance and homomorphic encryption. By using a homomorphic encryption scheme, each user encrypts his password point and response point selected on Google map, while the servers compute and decrypt the distance between the two encrypted points and then compare the resulting value with a tolerant distance for authentication. Moreover, the FS-GMGP system is extended for multi-server environment. The evaluation results and security analysis show that the FS-GMGP and its extended version achieve desirable usability and security in single-server environment and multi-server environment, respectively.}

	abstract = {As system designers are transitioning to the usage of pre-existing software architectural elements to reduce time-to-market and costs, they face challenges in safety-critical applications. Pre-existing software may have been implemented without following any safety and/or quality standard, and its documentation may be incomplete or unclear. As recommended by part 6 of the functional safety standard ISO 26262 (product development at the software level), stringent rules and guidelines must be followed during the implementation of a new software. The qualification of a pre-existing software according to ISO 26262 may hence be very time consuming and expensive if not addressed in a structured way. This work presents STPA for Pre-existing Software (STPA-PES), a new software hazardous behavior analysis approach designed to identify criticalities or abnormal conditions in complex pre-existing software to be mitigated with adequate safety measures. The major challenge in such a process consists in the definition of a model that correctly represents the system under analysis when the architectural design of pre-existing software is not available. As a relevant example, the proposed approach is finally applied to dynamic memory allocator (DynMA) in Linux kernel to show how STPA-PES is able to derive safety requirements of this software architectural element.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and the increasing diversification of user demands, interactions between different management domains have become more frequent. Identity authentication is an effective way to establish cross-domain trust and secure communication. However, the existing cross-domain authentication schemes of VANETs are limited to the same management or authentication technology for each domain and rely on centralized cross-domain identity management. Even distributed management solutions encounter latency sensitivity, security and privacy challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-assisted revocable cross-domain authentication scheme for VANETs. The proposed scheme can establish trust between domain entities by deploying different authentication methods and using distributed management to avoid single-point failures. In addition, the scheme can revoke the identity of malicious vehicles by updating the group public key, thereby ensuring the security and privacy of cross-domain Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. This design avoids the additional impacts of blockchain technology constraints on the high mobility and real-time requirements of VANETs. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme can resist more attacks and has better security than other related schemes while also achieving a better balance between communication and computational cost.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL), as a powerful learning paradigm, trains a shared model by aggregating model updates from distributed clients. However, the decoupling of model learning from local data makes FL highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a single compromised client can poison the shared model. While recent progress has been made in backdoor detection, existing methods face challenges with detection accuracy and runtime effectiveness, particularly when dealing with complex model architectures. In this work, we propose a novel approach to detecting malicious clients in an accurate, stable, and efficient manner. Our method utilizes a sampling-based network representation method to quantify dissimilarities between clients, identifying model deviations caused by backdoor injections. We also propose an iterative algorithm to progressively detect and exclude malicious clients as outliers based on these dissimilarity measurements. Evaluations across a range of benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and defense effectiveness. When deployed for runtime protection, our approach effectively eliminates backdoor injections with marginal overheads.}

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, have greatly simplified text generation tasks. However, they have also raised concerns about privacy risks such as data leakage and unauthorized information collection. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving inference face practical challenges related to computational time and communication costs. In this article, we propose InferDPT, the first practical framework for privacy-preserving Inference of closed-box LLMs, implementing Differential Privacy in Text generation. InferDPT comprises two key modules: the “perturbation module” utilizes the differentially private mechanism to generate a perturbed prompt, facilitating privacy-preserving inference with closed-box LLMs; the “extraction module”, inspired by knowledge distillation and phenomenon we observed, extracts coherent and consistent text from the perturbed generation result, ensuring successful text generation completion. To achieve a better balance between utility and privacy protection, we introduce RANTEXT, a novel differentially private mechanism integrated into the perturbation module of InferDPT, which introduces the concept of “RANdom adjacency list” for TEXT perturbation within the prompt. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that the text generation quality of InferDPT is comparable to that of non-private GPT-4, and RANTEXT surpasses existing state-of-the-art mechanisms, namely, SANTEXT+ and CUSTEXT+ in the trade-off between privacy and utility. Even with a privacy parameter  \\varepsilon \\varepsilon  value of 6.0, RANTEXT achieves an average privacy protection level of exceeding 0.90 against the embedding inversion attacks, which is 0.58× higher than that of SANTEXT+ and 3.35× higher than that of CUSTEXT+.}

	abstract = {The security of the FPGA cloud has become a major concern for both industry and academia due to its widespread use in many vital domains. In this article, we expose a hardware vulnerability in the FPGA cloud and demonstrate a covert and efficient denial-of-service (DoS) attack method that severely threatens the security of the FPGA cloud. First, we adopt a flip-flop-based ring oscillator (RO) to construct an adaptive ring oscillator network (RON). Second, we devise a power and temperature-based resource adjustment algorithm to decide the maximum number of ROs in the adaptive RON. By constraining the size of the adaptive RON, the power and the thermal footprint of the attack process can be reduced. Finally, we design an adaptive frequency sweeping algorithm to automatically search for an effective frequency and perform a successful attack on the FPGA. To validate our method, we conduct exemplary attacks on FPGAs. The results reveal that our method can successfully bypass the design rule checking (DRC) and security measures of the FPGA cloud to crash the FPGA. Besides high-end FPGAs, we demonstrate our method is suitable for some FPGAs with moderate performance. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the number of ROs and the duty cycle on the proposed method.}

	abstract = {While in-processing fairness approaches show promise in mitigating biased predictions, their potential impact on privacy leakage remains under-explored. We aim to address this gap by assessing the privacy risks of fairness-enhanced binary classifiers via membership inference attacks (MIAs) and attribute inference attacks (AIAs). Surprisingly, our results reveal that enhancing fairness does not necessarily lead to privacy compromises. For example, these fairness interventions exhibit increased resilience against MIAs and AIAs. This is because fairness interventions tend to remove sensitive information among extracted features and reduce confidence scores for the majority of training data for fairer predictions. However, during the evaluations, we uncover a potential threat mechanism that exploits prediction discrepancies between fair and biased models, leading to advanced attack results for both MIAs and AIAs. This mechanism reveals potent vulnerabilities of fair models and poses significant privacy risks of current fairness methods. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, attack methods, and representative fairness approaches confirm our findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the uncovered mechanism. Our study exposes the under-explored privacy threats in fairness studies, advocating for thorough evaluations of potential security vulnerabilities before model deployments.}

	abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) models are widely used in various scenarios, yet they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing works aim to mitigate this vulnerability, but each work targets a specific attack category or has computational overhead limitations, making them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the adversarial attack algorithms in NLP and discover that existing attack algorithms mainly disrupt the importance distribution of words in a text. A well-trained model can distinguish subtle importance distribution differences between clean and adversarial texts. Based on this intuition, we propose TextDefense, a new adversarial example detection framework that utilizes the target model’s capability to defend against adversarial attacks, requiring no prior knowledge. Unlike previous approaches, TextDefense is attack-type agnostic and outperforms existing methods in experiments with different architectures, datasets, and attack methods. We also discover that the target model’s generalizability is a leading factor influencing the performance of TextDefense. Finally, we provide insights into the adversarial attacks in NLP and the principles of our defense method by analyzing the properties of the target model and the adversarial example.}

	abstract = {Currently, sample-specific backdoor attacks (SSBAs) are the most advanced and malicious methods since they can easily circumvent most of the current backdoor defenses. In this paper, we reveal that SSBAs are not sufficiently stealthy due to their poisoned-label nature, where users can discover anomalies if they check the image-label relationship. In particular, we demonstrate that it is ineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants by poisoning samples solely from the target class. We reveal that it is primarily due to two reasons, including (1) the ‘antagonistic effects’ of ground-truth features and (2) the learning difficulty of sample-specific features. Accordingly, trigger-related features of existing SSBAs cannot be effectively learned under the clean-label setting due to their mild trigger intensity required for ensuring stealthiness. We argue that the intensity constraint of existing SSBAs is mostly because their trigger patterns are ‘content-irrelevant’ and therefore act as ‘noises’ for both humans and DNNs. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to exploit content-relevant features,  a.k.a. a . k . a . a.k.a.  (human-relied) attributes, as the trigger patterns to design clean-label SSBAs. This new attack paradigm is dubbed backdoor attack with attribute trigger (BAAT). Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our BAAT and its resistance to existing defenses.}

	abstract = {Privacy leakage poses a significant threat when machine learning foundation models trained on private data are released. One such threat is membership inference attacks (MIA), which determine whether a specific example was included in a model's training set. This article shifts focus from developing new MIA algorithms to measuring a model's risk under MIA. We introduce a novel metric, Relative Membership Risk (RMR), which assesses a model's MIA vulnerability from a comparative standpoint. RMR calculates the difference in prediction loss for training examples relative to a predefined reference model, enabling risk comparison across models without needing to delve into details like training strategy, architecture, or data distribution. We also explore the selection of the reference model and show that using a high-risk reference model enhances the accuracy of the RMR measure. To identify the most vulnerable reference model, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm that selects the optimal model from a set of candidates. Through extensive empirical evaluations on various datasets and network architectures, we demonstrate that RMR is an accurate and efficient tool for measuring the membership privacy risk of both individual training examples and the overall machine learning model.}

	abstract = {Passwords are today’s dominant form of authentication, and password guessing is the most effective method for evaluating password strength. Most password guessing models (e.g., PCFG, Markov, and RFGuess) regard passwords as sequences composed of basic units (i.e., characters/segments), with the information flow being unidirectional (i.e., predicting the next unit based on the preceding units). However, modeling passwords in a single direction fails to capture users’ password creation behavior that is actually impacted by the full password context. Through an in-depth analysis of real-world passwords, we reveal that users often create passwords around a central keyword, like common words, names, or dates, and then embellish them with numbers or symbols. Based on this observation, we, for the first time, attempt to parse passwords as trees. Unlike existing sequence models, trees can reveal the semantic connections within passwords and the logical thought processes users follow when creating passwords. For instance, in the password iloveyou, the basic units i and you are semantically dependent on the predicate love, forming a natural tree structure. We propose a trawling guessing model called PassTree and a targeted guessing model based on personally identifiable information (PII), named PassTree-PII. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our models: (1) PassTree outperforms its leading counterparts by 0.38%-2.51% when guessing numbers are below  10^{7} 10 7 10^{7} 107; (2) PassTree-PII achieves a cracking rate comparable to the state-of-the-art RFGuess-PII proposed in USENIX Security’23, but operates significantly more efficiently, using only 0.87% of the memory and being 16.60 times faster. Our work provides a new perspective on understanding user passwords and demonstrates a feasible technical route of applying tree structures to password guessing.}

	abstract = {Malware attack has been a serious threat to the security and privacy of both individual and corporation users of the Android platform. Business entities seek to protect themselves by means of monitoring privacy-related sensitive behaviors conducted on company-issued Android devices. However, due to Android’s own access control and privacy protection policies, this is difficult to be done with third-party apps using only normal privileges. Existing works proposed using side-channel readings from leaky APIs and system virtual files to speculate runtime app behaviors, which could be unreliable due to future system updates (that ban exploited resources), hardware jittering, etc. In this paper, we argue that a more traditional side-channel attack strategy, namely the CPU-cache-based side channel, could be exploited in the benign scenario of app behavior surveillance. Specifically, we propose CacheAlarm, a sensitive app behavior monitor and foreground app identification system, which works by measuring cache side-channel readings of selected methods within the Android framework, and conducted in-lab and in-the-wild user studies to compare the effectiveness of our scheme against SideNet, a previous Android app behavior surveillance scheme using API-based side channels. Results of the studies suggested that CacheAlarm outperforms SideNet on the accuracy of detecting sensitive behaviors in addition to gaining the capability of detecting apps running at foreground of the user device.}

In this article, we introduce SHIELD to examine the robustness of different code authorship attribution approaches against adversarial code examples. We define four attacks on attribution techniques, which include targeted and non-targeted attacks, and realize them using adversarial code perturbation. We experimented with a dataset of 200 programmers from the Google Code Jam competition to validate our methods. We target six state-of-the-art authorship attribution methods that adopt various techniques for extracting authorship traits from source code, including RNN, CNN, and code stylometry. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current authorship attribution methods against adversarial attacks. For the non-targeted attack, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current authorship attribution methods against the attack with an attack success rate exceeding 98. 5% accompanied by a degradation of the identification confidence exceeding 13%. For targeted attacks, we show the possibility of impersonating a programmer using targeted adversarial perturbations with a success rate ranging from 66% to 88% for different authorship attribution techniques under several adversarial scenarios.}

	abstract = {Defeating use-after-free exploits presents a challenging problem, one for which a universal solution remains elusive. Recent efforts towards efficient prevention of use-after-free exploits have found that delaying the reuse of freed memory can both be effective and efficient in many cases. Such efforts are again classified into two categories: one where reuse is postponed until the allocator can confidently ascertain the absence of any dangling pointers to the freed memory, and another that refrains from reusing a freed heap chunk until the program’s termination. We make an intriguing observation from our in-depth analysis of these two approaches and their reported performance impacts. When compared to the design that delays the reuse until the program terminates, the other strategy suffers from a significant performance overhead for some workloads. The change in the way each heap chunk is reused affects the distribution of allocated chunks in the heap, and the performance of some benchmarks. This study proposes HushVac+, an allocator that performs delayed reuse in such a way that the distribution of heap chunks becomes more friendly to such workloads. HushVac+ takes care of the locality when reusing previously freed heap chunks, adaptively pools the chunks considering the expected lifespan, and is assisted by a tailored OS service to quickly return physical pages to the system. An evaluation of HushVac+ showed that the average performance overhead of HushVac+ (1.5%) was similar to or lower than that of the state-of-the-art (11.4%, 4.7%, 0.0%, and 2.1%) when running the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite. Specifically, the overhead of HushVac+ on the distribution-sensitive benchmark, xalancbmk, was about 4.8% while the prior work has an overhead of 110%, 35.2%, 34.5%, and 27.1%.}

Various security tools are already employed in CI to detect malicious attacks. However, their operation is limited to a certain CI part or MLIN component without considering their integration and the ML end performance as the major indicator. We design and implement Knowledge Integration System Service (KISS) that introduces a novel approach to detect and classify attacks into adversarial attacks against ML end system (A-Attacks), and against base MLIN infrastructure (B-Attacks). Unlike traditional security mechanisms, KISS examines how attacks on individual MLIN components impact the overall ML end system performance, and extracts and integrates knowledge from each MLIN CI component to better distinguish between the attack types. As our major contributions, we (1) investigate the effects of A- and B-Attacks on ML systems, actively used in industry. We (2) develop the KISS prototype and verify it in practice. We demonstrate how KISS can be integrated into already established MLIN CI and combined with the traditional security tools. Our experiments verify that KISS improves attack detection and their initial classification between A- and B-Attacks in MLIN operational setups.}

	abstract = {Supporting vehicular emergency applications requires fast access to infrastructure so vehicles can call for help. Because of their environment's poor wireless qualities, vehicle infrastructure communication paths lack security. Modern authentication systems used to close security vulnerabilities require a lot of computing and storage power from the vehicle's OBU. Thus, a novel 5G automobile network emergency situations based on Chebyshev polynomial using fog computing and authentication is proposed. This is the first study to use Chebyshev chaotic mapping algorithm that uses a chaotic map, rotation, and XOR to generate a one-way hash and eliminate modular multiplication index or scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve. The proposed scheme has five stages: installation system, initialization, enrollment, mutual authentication, and emergency request. Critical to emergency services, the suggested protocol works better in resource-limited settings like car systems. The formal security analysis reveals that the suggested approach guarantees message authenticity and integrity, non-repudiation, traceability, unlinkability, identity privacy, certificate independence, and emergency response. The evaluation showed that the proposed method cannot execute forgery, impersonation, or replay attacks. The proposed method has lower computational, communication, and storage overhead than earlier efforts.}

	abstract = {Over the years, various mobile communication technologies have been developed and operated simultaneously, which made the mobile communication networks evolved from single-mode access to complex heterogeneous integration. The current 5 G has already accommodated diverse terminals through multiple access paths, but the upcoming 6 G ambitiously aims to achieve ubiquitous connectivity through space-air-ground-sea integrated networks. However, traditional authentication and management protocols, such as EPS-AKA and 5G-AKA, are designed for specific networks and lack the flexibility to adapt to the diverse and dynamic requirements of 6G. This limitation will inevitably result in complex management, enormous overhead, and unmanageable security risks. In this paper, we present an atomic functional module-based 6G authentication protocol combination framework (AotmAuth) to decompose the existing authentication protocols into reusable basic modules, and by combining these modules, flexible authentication protocols can be constructed to meet specific security and performance requirements. The proposed approach can significantly improve the robustness, extensibility and dependability of protocols cobmination, by simplify protocol design, enhance adaptability across diverse scenarios and facilitate quick improvements by replacing or adjusting specific modules. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we design and develop a 6G heterogeneous access security testbed. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve higher authentication efficiency while ensuring security compared to traditional authentication methods.}

	abstract = {BCube stands as a renowned server-centric data center network (DCN), boasting numerous advantages, such as low diameter, high aggregate throughput, and abundant parallel paths. As DCNs expand rapidly, followed by the daily increasing likelihood of failures, fault tolerance has become an impor tant issue in DCNs. Hamiltonian paths constitute a pivotal network topology for parallel and distributed computing, suitable for designing deadlock-free routing algorithms, fault-tolerant routing algorithms, and congestion avoidance. The partitioned edge fault (PEF) model is a recently proposed fault model that exploits the properties of networks to achieve fault tolerance with an exponential scale. In this paper, we explore the existence of Hamiltonian paths in BCube under the PEF model. Since one switch failure will result in multiple faulty links, we also extend the conclusions related to Hamiltonian paths to analyze the fault tolerance of BCube under the PEF model when switch failures occur. Moreover, we provide algorithms to embed a Hamiltonian path between arbitrary two distinct servers into BCube under the PEF model. Experimental analysis and comparisons demonstrate that our approach exhibits exponential enhancements over the other known results, and BCube DCNs possess remarkable fault tolerance in response to both link and switch failures under the PEF model. As a by-product, we obtain a deadlock-free routing based on the constructed Hamiltonian path and assess the routing performance compared to the benchmark routing algorithms.}

	abstract = {With the increase of private data being collected by data owners, it has been a trend for data owners to store the data on cloud computing platforms. The huge amounts of data in cloud servers bring fresh development opportunities to machine learning, which is applied to build a high-quality machine learning model based on a large training dataset. However, to ensure the privacy of data and facilitate retrieval, data owners often upload encrypted data under their public keys. But it creates new challenges for machine learning to learn a predictive model over these encrypted data under different keys. Most existing privacy-preserving machine learning works make contributions over one dataset or multiple datasets encrypted with the same public key, which limits the utilization of these schemes in practice. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario as the secure learning algorithm involves multiple data sources encrypted with different public keys. In this setting, we present a novel scheme for privacy-preserving ridge regression over arbitrarily-partitioned datasets to protect the confidentiality of raw data and the model. To achieve secure computing and the best performance, we construct privacy-preserving computation protocols using a linearly-homomorphic encryption (LHE) scheme and an additive homomorphic proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme. The security analysis shows that our scheme satisfies the predefined security requirements. The theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations on varying datasets demonstrate its practicability.}

	abstract = {Due to the decentralized and public nature of the blockchain ecosystem, malicious activities on the Ethereum platform impose immeasurable losses on users. At the same time, the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions provides a unique opportunity to analyze illegal activities, such as phishing scams, from a network perspective. Most existing phishing scam detection methods focus primarily on analyzing account interaction networks, which limits their ability to uncover transaction behavior patterns embedded within transaction interactions. To address this, we construct the Transaction SubGraph Network (TSGN) by using transaction subgraphs as basic elements and further propose a novel framework for Ethereum phishing account detection. Specifically, we rebuild the graph structures via three well-designed mapping mechanisms, yielding TSGN and its two variants, i.e., Directed-TSGN and Temporal-TSGN, to obtain direction-aware and time-aware transfer flow features. By further incorporating the mapping strategy into transaction multidigraphs, we develop the Multiple-TSGN, which could preserve more transaction flow features while concurrently reducing the time consumption of modeling large-scale networks. TSGN models based on transaction subgraph interactions can capture complex higher-order dependencies, which lay beyond the reach of models that exclusively capture pairwise account interactions. As a general framework, our model can incorporate various feature extraction methods to improve the performance of phishing detection. Extensive experimental results on Ethereum datasets show that our method achieves superior performance in phishing detection, yielding 3.27% \\sim \\sim 6.71% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art.}

However, the smart contract responsible for managing NFT may contain defects, which can be exploited by attackers to cause severe damage to victims. We take the first step to systematically analyze three kinds of defects on NFT contracts, namely fragile NFT binding, non-compliant implementation, and implanted backdoor. In particular, we propose Emerium, the first extensible detection framework for capturing these defects by inspecting the bytecode of smart contracts. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate Emerium, and the experimental results show that it can detect the aforementioned defects with 0.83 and 0.89 F-measure for ERC-721 contracts and ERC-1155 contracts, respectively. Applying Emerium to 87,839 ERC-721 and 9,808 ERC1155 NFT contracts of real world, we uncover 44,863,255 defects of fragile NFT binding, 1,373 defects of non-compliant implementation, and 105 defects of backdoor (also with a new CVE).}

	abstract = {Multi-Party Computation (MPC), as a distributed computing paradigm, is considered to be a potential solution for providing privacy-preserving for applications following the client-server model. However, traditional MPC solutions cannot satisfy the publicly verifiable requirement of the client-server model. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based verifiable MPC solution using Pedersen's threshold secret sharing and Lifted ElGamal encryption. We first build a data distribution method using Pedersen's threshold secret sharing and symmetric encryption to protect the privacy of inputs while ensuring robustness. Then, we propose a result processing algorithm using Lifted ElGamal encryption to safeguard the privacy of the outputs. Finally, we employ non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and Pedersen commitment to publicly verify the correctness of the encrypted outputs in the smart contract, enabling the detection of malicious parties. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed method can publicly verify the correctness of outputs without revealing plain-text inputs and outputs, which satisfy the privacy-preserving requirements of the client-server model. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed approach is efficient regarding computation overhead, communication overhead, and response time in the output verification phase while achieving stronger privacy and robustness.}

Therefore, attackers are constantly looking for alternative and stealthy approaches to exfiltrate private data from a targeted device. This paper presents CovertPower, a covert channel attack that exfiltrates user data by actively inducing power consumption on Android devices. At the transmitting end, our CovertPower app modulates binary data into a timed resource workload (e.g., processor, write-on-memory), producing power consumption bursts. On the receiving end, we acquire power consumption traces via a low-cost hardware tool that can be easily concealed in USB wall-socket adapters or powerbanks. Therefore, a signal processing-based decoder analyzes such traces and retrieves the exfiltrated information. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack with a thorough experimental evaluation on 14 mobile devices and various real-world settings such as display state, ongoing activities, and charging technologies. Our attack achieves a transfer speed of up to 10 bps with a high bit sequence similarity on most devices and settings considered.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) allows for collaborative training without centralizing data, but concerns regarding model privacy leakage, intellectual property theft and poisoning attacks have hindered its development. To mitigate such risks, this article proposes embedded message authentication code technology (EMAC) to integrate encryption, digital signatures, and watermark functions for model security. In EMAC, the authentication data is embedded into the model ciphertext using reversible data hiding after encryption. The marked ciphertext supports data extraction for subsequent authentication and lossless decryption for testing and training simultaneously. Based on EMAC, a novel FL with security authentication and traceability of poisoning (FL-SATP) is proposed, which integrates privacy protection, identity authentication and poisoning traceability into FL. The poisoner tracing is designed to detect and identify poisoners retrospectively based on the practical performance of trained or aggregated models, thus removing the malicious users’ model and deterring poisoning behaviors. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that FL-SATP could ensure the confidentiality of the model content, the availability of model function, and that when more than half of the users are benign, the proposed method can accurately and efficiently pinpoint all malicious poisoners in FL.}

This article presents a stochastic availability model designed through a Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) that considers the aging of satellites, offering support for infrastructure planning by integrating both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance considerations. Additionally, this research includes two case studies. The first case study explores an availability model that ignores the influence of aging, establishing a baseline of availability and second with aging. This baseline will be compared with the results obtained from the proposed SPN model, which incorporates the effects of aging. In this way, the behavior of both non-aging and aging variables can be analyzed to make contributions through the SPN that helps understand the availability of satellite systems.}

	abstract = {Many network middleboxes have been deployed to perform deep packet inspection (DPI) over packet payloads. However, such middleboxes cannot accomplish their tasks when the traffic is encrypted. BlindBox (SIGCOMM 2015) provided the first solution for performing DPI over encrypted traffic. To improve its efficiency, a later proposal PrivDPI (CCS 2019) introduced a practical technique to generate encrypted rules. However, a recent proposal P2DPI (ASIACCS 2021) showed that the rule generator in PrivDPI can comprise the user’s privacy. In this article, we present a new attack on P2DPI and show that the privacy of its endpoints can still be compromised by the rule generator. We comprehensively analyze the vulnerability of prior studies and present PrivBox, a new DPI system that achieves the same privacy guarantee as BlindBox while maintaining practical efficiency. This is based on a new technique called dual double-masking obfuscated rule generation. For a ruleset of 3,000, PrivBox achieves connection establishment time on the endpoint side comparable to PrivDPI and supports up to 4,672 token encryptions per second, which is sufficient for a number of real-world applications. Overall, our experiment demonstrates that PrivBox is practical and well-suited for short, frequently established sessions, especially when token repeating is common.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology, known for its decentralization and immutability, has been widely applied across various domains. However, this immutability reveals limitations in adapting to rapidly changing legal environments and preventing malicious misuse. To introduce a degree of flexibility, various transaction-level redactable blockchain solutions have been proposed. Yet, current schemes grant modifiers redaction privileges by providing access to the trapdoor, potentially posing risks of malicious dissemination and abuse of the trapdoor. In this article, we first propose an RSA-based threshold chameleon hash (TCH) construction, allowing the distribution of the trapdoor among a group of authorities. Building on TCH, we develop a threshold policy-based chameleon hash (TPCH). Compared to the Policy-Based Chameleon Hash (PCH) proposed by Derler at NDSS’19, our TPCH supports authorization without exposing the trapdoor. Furthermore, leveraging TPCH, we introduce a novel transaction-level redactable blockchain (TPRB). TPRB supports decentralized authorization without trapdoor exposure and fine-grained rewriting control. Finally, through implementation and evaluation, we demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our TCH and TPCH schemes.}

To address the high heterogeneity and imbalance between network security data, we propose a multidimensional few-shot data augmentation framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating high-quality malicious samples to balance data distribution. In this framework, several representative GAN models, including PE-GAN, XOR-GAN, and TriNet-GAN, are designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models in network threat detection. Large-scale adversarial generation experiments are conducted on the original imbalanced dataset and security event logs using AC-GAN and Seq-GAN, effectively solving the imbalance and few-shot issues. The experimental results are based on the publicly available NIMS (Network Information Management and Security Group) and KDD99 datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in data augmentation for few-shot, imbalanced, and multidimensional complex data.}

	abstract = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables us to compute the intersection of private sets without leaking additional data. The state-of-the-art PSI protocol  \\mathsf {RR22} \\mathsf {RR22}  (CCS 2022) is derived from an Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function (OPRF) protocol based on Oblivious Key-Value Stores (OKVS). However, the existing OKVS suffers either low computation efficiency or high encoding redundancy. In this work, we propose a new efficient bucket-based OKVS with only 1% redundancy. The encoding algorithm of our OKVS is 4 to 15 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art OKVS (USENIX Security 2023). Specifically, our OKVS can encode  2^{24} 2^{24}  key-value pairs in only 2.1 to 8.5 seconds, corresponding to 30% to 1% redundancy, while the latter takes about 30 seconds with at least 3%. We can then obtain a new ultra-fast PSI protocol with lower communication from our OKVS in both semi-honest and malicious settings. Furthermore, we implemented our PSI protocol and conducted an extensive evaluation, which shows that it outperforms the existing PSI protocols, such as  \\mathsf {KKRT16} \\mathsf {KKRT16}  (CCS 2016),  \\mathsf {CM20} \\mathsf {CM20}  (Crypto 2020),  \\mathsf {RS21} \\mathsf {RS21}  (EuroCrypt 2021),  \\mathsf {RR22} \\mathsf {RR22}  (CCS 2022), and  \\mathsf {KBM23} \\mathsf {KBM23}  (NDSS 2023). Since our PSI features an ultra-low communication overhead, it has overall advantages for the network environment with a small bandwidth. For example, our PSI takes only about 468 and 476 seconds in semi-honest and malicious settings with the input size of  2^{24} 2^{24}  when the bandwidth is 10 Mbps, while the state-of-the-art  \\mathsf {RR22} \\mathsf {RR22}  requires about 541 and 625 seconds.}

	abstract = {In recent years, binary malware detection has attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. However, most of the existing work only focuses on judging whether a sample is malicious or not, rather than identifying malicious modules in malware. Few studies aiming at locating malicious code work on the function granularity and suffer from inaccuracy. In this article, we address this problem by locating malicious code at the functional module (FM) granularity, which combines several functions to express the malicious behaviors of malware. We design a tool called MalFocus to automatically divide malware into FMs and then identify the malicious functional module (MFM) in a multi-model hybrid manner, in which an unsupervised model and an interpretability approach based on a binary classifier are combined, eliminating the workload of labeling malware samples, determining the scope of MFMs and ranking them according to their maliciousness. The identified MFMs are then passed to security analysts for verification, helping to significantly reduce the scope of manual analysis while providing a comprehensive view of the malware attack flow. Additionally, rules derived from the verified MFMs can be used to detect variants and new malware families with different functionalities, offering a more general and flexible detection approach. We evaluate MalFocus's performance on 6764 real-world samples. The results show that MalFocus can correctly identify 95% of MFMs, outperforming current state-of-the-art work.}

	abstract = {In recent years, neural network models have been widely used in many tasks, however, tampering operations from malicious attackers, e.g., backdoor attacks and parameter malicious tampering, can easily degrade the model performance or cause a malfunction. To protect the integrity of neural network model, in this paper, we propose a neural network watermarking scheme with hierarchical recoverability (NNWHR), which not only can identify and locate the tampered parameters, but also can recover the tampered parameters in a hierarchical way. Detailedly, the parameters of to-be-protected network layers are first sorted according to the parameter importances, which are calculated through a specifically designed strategy for parameter evaluation. Then, the reference sharing mechanism is used to generate more number of recovery bits and provide greater perfect recovery probabilities for the parameters with higher importances, which can also deal with larger tampering rates through bit interleaving. Finally, the recovery bits and the authentication bits of model parameters are incorporated as watermark bits and embedded into the model redundant space after scrambling. Experimental results show that our scheme can locate tampered model parameters and recover corresponding model performance with satisfactory accuracy, and can also be applied to eliminate backdoor attacks. In addition, our scheme exhibits satisfactory generalizability, which makes it applicable to various types of neural networks.}

	abstract = {Despite being widely used in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), machine learning (ML) has proven to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Transparent-box and opaque-box adversarial ML attacks of NIDS have been explored in several studies. However, transparent-box attacks unrealistically assume that the attackers have full knowledge of the target NIDSs. Meanwhile, existing opaque-box attacks can not achieve high attack success rate due to the weak adversarial transferability between models (e.g., neural networks and tree models). Additionally, neither of them explains why adversarial examples exist and why they can transfer across models. To address these challenges, this article introduces ETA, an Explainable Transfer-based Opaque-Box Adversarial Attack framework. ETA aims to achieve two primary objectives: 1) create transferable adversarial examples applicable to various ML detectors and 2) provide insights into the existence of adversarial examples and their transferability within NIDSs. Specifically, we first provide a general transfer-based adversarial attack method applicable across the entire ML space. Following that, we exploit a unique insight based on cooperative game theory and perturbation interpretations to explain adversarial examples and adversarial transferability. On this basis, we propose an Important-Sensitive Feature Selection (ISFS) method to guide the search for adversarial examples, achieving stronger transferability and ensuring traffic-space constraints. Finally, the experimental results on three NIDSs datasets show that our method performs significantly effectively against several classical and state-of-the-art ML classifiers, outperforming the latest baselines. We conduct three interpretation experiments and two cases to verify our interpretation method’s correctness. Meanwhile, we uncover two major misconceptions about applying machine learning to NIDSs systems.}

	abstract = {The widespread application of face recognition poses unprecedented threats to individual privacy, as face images can be easily and stealthily analyzed. Efforts have been made to employ adversarial perturbations to disrupt the automatic inference of unauthorized face recognition systems. However, existing schemes fail to satisfy the personalized protection requirements of individuals, which may diminish the user experience. In this article, we propose a novel scheme that provides tailor-made face privacy protection for individuals via class-wise targeted universal adversarial perturbations (CT-UAPs). In our scheme, each individual can utilize a user-specific CT-UAP to exclusively generate protected faces whose identification outputs are a virtual identity predefined by themselves. For the generation of CT-UAPs, we develop an optimization-based method that guides the feature vectors of the protected faces to approach the class-wise feature space of the predefined virtual identity while simultaneously approaching that of the original identity. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against five face recognition models. In addition, the interpretability of CT-UAPs is highlighted by the experimental results obtained through two-dimensional principal component analysis.}

This functionality is generally required when the PSI protocol is used as a part of a larger secure two-party computation protocol. Existing protocols for similar functionalities have a cuckoo table mapping in the functionality, and therefore the output is not directly indexed on the intersection but on the cuckoo table mapping of the intersection, which complicates the application of different secure computation techniques on top of the output. We introduce a conversion technique based on additively homomorphic encryption used in the construction of our PSI protocol as a separate protocol and show that it can be utilized to convert the existing circuit and secure-computation PSI protocols into the protocols realizing the functionality not having the mapping.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks can reveal the users’ online privacy by the traffic analysis technique, even with the protection of the Tor anonymity network. Recent WF attacks tend to leverage the deep learning (DL) models, which require a large number of traffic samples for training. In this case, it is impractical for low-resource adversaries in reality. Thus, we propose a lightweight WF attack to tackle this challenge, i.e., Deep Quadruplet Fingerprinting (DQF), which only needs one training sample to obtain an accuracy of 87.1%. Regarding the overall design, DQF first combines the metric learning and meta-learning schemes. To improve the generalization ability of the trained model, DQF leverages the quadruplet networks as the architecture and modifies the quadruplet loss function. Besides, by taking the deep local fingerprinting features (DLFFs), DQF avoids losing a lot of discriminative information, which is a problem with previous attacks. To evaluate DQF, we use multiple typical datasets and conduct 11 different experiments. In closed-world settings, the accuracy of DQF can exceed the best baseline attack by 10%. In open-world settings, DQF steadily performs the best even in the most challenging scenario, namely, 1-shot learning, where previous attacks significantly degrade the performance or even fail.}

	abstract = {Graph matching, as an important query technology, has been widely applied in various fields. With the increasing of graph data, users choose to encrypt a large number of graphs and store them in the cloud. Existing solutions to graph matching query over encrypted graphs require the user to execute a lot of time-consuming subgraph isomorphism (NP-complete problem) operations to extract the matched graphs, which inevitably brings heavy computational burden to the user. Therefore, how to reduce the number of subgraph isomorphisms is crucial for releasing the user from the heavy workload in a graph matching query scheme over encrypted graphs. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient scheme for graph matching query over encrypted graphs. The main idea is to classify the query graph into frequent subgraph and infrequent subgraph, and adopt different strategies to perform the matching query. We design the novel secure index based on the frequent subgraphs and the edge labels to reduce the number of subgraph isomorphisms. When the query graph is a frequent subgraph, the proposed scheme can directly produce the exact result owing to this secure index. The user does not need to perform any subgraph isomorphism in this case. When the query graph is an infrequent subgraph, the proposed scheme can return a set of data graphs very close to the exact result. As a result, the proposed scheme reduces the number of subgraph isomorphisms substantially. Formal security proof is provided. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that the proposed scheme reduces nearly 90% subgraph isomorphism.}

It is crucial to detect such confusing warnings to avoid danger. Existing solutions to address this issue heavily rely on trust entities or are constructed based on number theory assumptions, leading to low efficiency and vulnerability to quantum attacks. In this paper, we leverage the double authentication-preventing signature scheme (DAPS) to present a revocable identity-based double-authentication preventing signature scheme (RIDAPS) and provides an instantiation from lattice. Furthermore, we propose a post-quantum secure misbehavior preventing scheme (Misp) based on our RIDAPS scheme. We give a detailed proof in the random oracle model (ROM) to demonstrate that our contribution achieves security requirements. Additionally, the efficiency evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme is suitable to be applied in V2X.}

Existing hand authentication schemes, however, use dedicated hardware, such as infrared or depth cameras, which are not available on commodity mobile devices. In this paper, we present EchoHand, a high accuracy and presentation attack resistant authentication scheme that complements camera-based 2-dimensional hand geometry recognition of one hand with an active acoustic sensing of the other hand. To this end, EchoHand plays an inaudible acoustic signal using the speaker to actively sense the holding hand and collects the echoes using the microphone. EchoHand does not rely on any specialized hardware but uses the built-in speaker, microphone and camera. EchoHand does not place more burdens on users than existing hand authentication methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the reliability, security, and usability of EchoHand. The results show that EchoHand has a low equal error rate of 2.45% with as few as 10 training data points and it defeats presentation attacks. The results of the user study also suggest that the required hand gestures are easy to perform, and EchoHand is very user-friendly with low latency.}

However, existing schemes did not consider the unforgeability and aggregtability of access permissions and the traceability of illegal users. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized signature-based access control (PPDSBAC) scheme to fix the above problems. In our scheme, each access permission is a multi- signatures on a keyword, time period and pseudonym, hence is unforgeable and aggregatable. Services are encrypted by using different keywords and time periods. A user can use a pseudonym to access a service directly if he/she gets required access permissions from required authorization authorities. Furthermore, in the case that trace is required, a trace authority can de-anonymise users and identify their real identities. We formalize both the definition and security model of our scheme, and propose a concrete construction. Then, the implementation and evaluation are conducted to show its efficiency. Finally, the security of our scheme is formally proven. The novelty is to construct a PPDAC scheme with unlinkable access requests, unforgeable and aggregatable access permissions, non-interactive authentication and traceability.}

	abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize medical image classification. However, machine learning requires large medical datasets to improve accuracy, which will compromise patient privacy. Federated learning is a promising technique that protects patient privacy and improves the accuracy of medical image classification. Unfortunately, current research shows that federated learning faces the risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving federal learning scheme via hybrid differential privacy for medical image classification (FHDM). Specifically, we construct a local hybrid differential privacy algorithm (LHDP) against patients’ privacy leakage. This hybrid algorithm combines Gaussian and Laplace differential privacy without enlarging the privacy budget. We prove that the algorithm applies to the model parameter. Moreover, we design loss optimization and global optimization strategies on the algorithm to achieve higher accuracy in medical image classification. Finally, we validate FHDM in terms of privacy-preserving and model accuracy on real datasets. Experiments show that FHDM effectively protects privacy and improves the average accuracy by 9.60% compared to previous differential privacy schemes with the same medical image dataset and privacy budget.}

However, recent works demonstrate that FL models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which can infer whether a data sample was used to train a given FL model. Existing countermeasures either require far-reaching modifications of FL training process or enforce extra processing in prediction phase, yielding them unlikely to be applied well in practice. In this article, we design a post-protection mechanism, dubbed P ^{2} ^{2} 2-Protection, which degrades the inference performance of MIAs by simultaneously poisoning the prediction and gradient of the target FL model to reduce the privacy leakage of training data while keeping the model prediction accuracy. P ^{2} ^{2} 2-Protection only involves one additional training round to embed the poisoned prediction and gradient into the target FL model, without requiring model retraining or training process modification. We evaluate P ^{2} ^{2} 2-Protection and compare it with two state-of-the-art defenses against three MIAs on five realistic datasets. Experimental results show that P ^{2} ^{2} 2-Protection outperforms the existing defenses by offering limited implementation overhead and improved utility-privacy trade-off.}

	abstract = {Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) shifts identity management authority from central institutions to users, enhancing privacy protections. However, malicious identity providers may collude with users to issue credentials that pass verification but contain false information. While multi-signature schemes enable joint credential issuance by multiple identity providers to mitigate this risk, they result in a linear increase in the size of signatures within credentials and verification keys as the number of identity providers grows, leading to substantial storage overhead for both users and verifiers. Furthermore, malicious verifiers may leak users’ credentials to third parties or unlawfully duplicate them, causing users to lose control over the distribution of their credentials. To address these challenges, we propose the Accountable Many-to-One Signature Scheme with Short Verification Key (ASVK-MOSS), a multi-signature scheme with designated verifiers and accountability that ensures fixed sizes for both the verification key and the signature. We prove the security of the proposed ASVK-MOSS under the random oracle model. Building on ASVK-MOSS, we design a novel SSI system, named MO-SSI, in which multiple identity providers jointly sign the user’s personal information to generate a credential with fixed sizes. Service providers only need to store a minimal, fixed-size verification key to validate the credentials from any set of identity providers. Additionally, the designated verifier and accountability mitigate risks posed by malicious service providers and identity providers within MO-SSI. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility.}

	abstract = {As machine learning continues to develop and data misuse scandals become more prevalent, individuals are becoming increasingly concerned about their personal information and are advocating for the right to remove their data. Machine unlearning has emerged as a solution to erase training data from trained machine learning models. Despite its success in classifiers, research on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is limited due to their unique architecture, including a generator and a discriminator. One challenge pertains to generator unlearning, as the process could potentially disrupt the continuity and completeness of the latent space. This disruption might consequently diminish the model's effectiveness after unlearning. Another challenge is how to define a criterion that the discriminator should perform for the unlearning images. In this paper, we introduce a substitution mechanism and define a fake label to effectively mitigate these challenges. Based on the substitution mechanism and fake label, we propose a cascaded unlearning approach for both item and class unlearning within GAN models, in which the unlearning and learning processes run in a cascaded manner. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the cascaded unlearning technique using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ datasets, analyzing its performance across four key aspects: unlearning effectiveness, intrinsic model performance, impact on downstream tasks, and unlearning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves significantly improved item and class unlearning efficiency, reducing the required time by up to $185\\times$ and $284\\times$ for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, in comparison to retraining from scratch. Notably, although the model's performance experiences minor degradation after unlearning, this reduction is negligible when dealing with a minimal number of images (e.g., 64) even for high-resolution FFHQ dataset and has no adverse effects on downstream tasks such as classification.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. To protect user privacy during model aggregation, secure aggregation (SA) protocols are widely adopted to mask models. However, existing SA protocols require at least three round trips per aggregation and lack mechanisms to verify aggregation results. Verifiable SA addresses the verification gap but incurs high communication costs. TEE-based SA minimizes round trips but faces computational bottlenecks due to TEE’s limited physical memory, especially when handling larger models or numerous clients. In this work, we introduce OPSA, an efficient and verifiable one-pass SA protocol based on TEE. By handling client dropouts via server-side TEE, OPSA enables the server to aggregate masked models in a single pass, significantly reducing round trips. To mitigate TEE’s limitations, OPSA offloads tasks like model aggregation and mask elimination outside TEE, with only shared keys processed within TEE. Building on this design, we propose KhPRF-OPSA (single masking) and POT-OPSA (double masking) protocols, both incorporating novel cryptographic primitives. Furthermore, OPSA integrates commitment and signature mechanisms to ensure result verifiability with only  O(1) O(1)  additional communication overhead per client. Compared to state-of-the-art schemes, OPSA achieves a 2 \\sim 10\\times \\sim 10\\times  speedup in multi-round aggregation while guaranteeing result verification.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based IoT applications in agriculture have drawn extensive attention in recent years, allowing the implementation of smart agriculture solutions. By transmitting collected relevant data to a control center through the blockchain, corresponding regulation can be realized in agricultural production management systems. However, existing efforts for directly adopting the technique to data transmission are obstructed by several issues. The traceability of agricultural data stored in the blockchain leads to the exposure of the identity of the data collecting devices. And the tracing difficulty of completely invisible data for identity protection also exists in the smart agricultural system. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel blockchain-based smart agricultural IoT system framework for regulating the agricultural production environment through trusted data. First, the elliptic curve integrated encryption scheme (ECIES) and the group signature scheme are integrated to guarantee the traceability and identity protection of the data and equipment, respectively. Then, to enhance the security of session key transmission in the ECIES scheme, we further design an on-chain-off-chain key agreement protocol (ECIES-OOKA). In addition, we propose a novel group manager selection method based on probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) for the group signature implementation. Finally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate the group manager selection process and verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The security and performance analysis for the system framework are also presented.}

	abstract = {Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between the client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for the local model updates. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated by local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose a parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. The experiment results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while incurring lower costs for computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.}

	abstract = {Universal low bit-rate speech steganalysis is a cutting-edge research task addressing real-world application needs and has garnered significant attention recently. However, the existing methods are still inadequate in extracting available information from various steganographic domains and fail to deliver interpretable forensic results for specific steganographic domains containing embedded information. In view of this, we present a novel universal low bit-rate speech steganalysis approach that seamlessly combines domain-specific and domain-shared information, enabling comprehensive and effective speech steganography detection. This approach comprises two vital components: the Matching Identification Network (MIN) and the Content Alignment Network (CAN). The MIN incorporates three effective separable backbones for capturing informative domain-specific embeddings, inherently unveiling local and global dependencies. In this network, we also design a cross-domain matching module to establish correlations among steganographic domains, thereby enhancing detection performance through multi-domain collaboration and facilitating effective forensics for the embedded domains. Moreover, the CAN acquires more informative domain-shared embeddings by using a metric learning-based Siamese architecture to process pairs of naive and recompressed speech samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented method not only significantly surpasses the existing universal steganalysis methods, but also competes with or even surpasses dedicated steganalysis methods in certain cases. In addition, our method can provide accurate forensic results regarding the existence of hidden information within each steganographic domain without relevant supervisory information, marking a significant milestone in pursuit of speech steganalysis.}

	abstract = {Blockchain systems have evolved over decades, addressing the inefficiencies and high costs associated with centralized architectures. Among various consensus mechanisms, committee-based hybrid Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols are a fundamental approach to blockchain consensus. However, designing a hybrid BFT consensus protocol that ensures fairness, responsiveness, and formal security remains challenging. In this paper, we propose GRBFT: a Gaussian reputation-based hybrid BFT blockchain consensus protocol with a formal security framework. Our proposed protocol integrates a multilateral Gaussian reputation evaluation to incentivize trusted nodes’ participation in the consensus. We use threshold signatures and verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members and leaders, ensuring fair reconfiguration and unbiased sortition. A formal security framework is utilized to design and analyze the blockchain consensus system. Additionally, we design a speculative GRBFT (S-GRBFT) protocol to circumvent the traditional  \\mathcal {O}(n^{2}) \\mathcal {O}(n^{2})  leader sortition complexity and reduce the communication to  \\mathcal {O}(n) \\mathcal {O}(n)  within a single round. Moreover, we present a secure candidate committee reconfiguration method that efficiently updates members based on their reputation and a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. The proposed GRBFT protocol is proven to achieve consistency and liveness under the corruption and liveness parameters.}

However, existing FL methods are difficult to collect enough data for training the global model more accurately, especially in cross-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new federated generative adversarial network empowered by differential privacy and knowledge transfer named Fed-GAN, which can be used to address the problem of data shortage and prevent generator leakage from resource-constrained devices, as well as generate high-quality synthetic data while ensuring strict DP guarantees. Different from other generative model methods, our Fed-GAN framework can achieve efficient and secure generative model training and limited permission for resource-constrained devices to prevent them from leaking or misusing the generator. In addition, we propose a pHash-KT method for our Fed-GAN framework, which selects potentially high-quality data through the knowledge of each client for improving the utility of synthetic data. Our Fed-GAN framework satisfies   (\\frac{2k J\\lambda }{\\sigma ^{2}}+\\frac{\\log 1 / \\delta }{\\lambda -1}, \\delta ) ( 2 k J λ σ 2 + log 1 / δ λ − 1 , δ )  (\\frac{2k J\\lambda }{\\sigma ^{2}}+\\frac{\\log 1 / \\delta }{\\lambda -1}, \\delta ) -DP, and also has high resistance when number of adversaries is 10%–70% of the total number of clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Fed-GAN framework not only generates high-quality synthetic data, but also provides strict DP guarantees, compared with other generative model methods.}

	abstract = {The adversarial example presents new security threats to trustworthy detection systems. In the context of evading dynamic detection based on API call sequences, a practical approach involves inserting perturbing API calls to modify these sequences. The type of inserted API calls and their insertion locations are crucial for generating an effective adversarial API call sequence. Existing methods either optimize the inserted API calls while neglecting the insertion positions or treat these optimizations as separate processes. This can lead to inefficient attacks that insert a large number of unnecessary API calls. To address this issue, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, dubbed GAME-RL, which simultaneously optimizes both the perturbing APIs and their insertion positions. Specifically, we define malware modification through IAT (Import Address Table) hooking as a sequential decision-making process. We introduce an invalid action masking and an auto-regressive policy head within the RL framework, ensuring the feasibility of IAT hooking and capturing the inherent relationship between factors. GAME-RL learns more effective evasion strategies, taking into account functionality preservation and the black-box setting. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various target models, demonstrating that GAME-RL significantly improves the evasion rate while maintaining acceptable levels of adversarial overhead.}

	abstract = {Cross-silo federated learning (FL) enables multiple institutions (clients) to collaboratively build a global model without sharing private data. To prevent privacy leakage during aggregation, homomorphic encryption (HE) is widely used to encrypt model updates, yet incurs high computation and communication overheads. To reduce these overheads, packed HE (PHE) has been proposed to encrypt multiple plaintexts into a single ciphertext. However, the original design of PHE assumes all clients share a single private key, making the system vulnerable to security threats of ciphertexts being intercepted and decrypted by honest-but-curious clients. Also, it does not consider the heterogeneity among different clients, resulting in undermined training efficiency with slow convergence and stragglers. To address these challenges, we propose FedPHE, a secure and efficient FL framework with PHE by jointly exploiting contribution-aware secure aggregation and straggler-resistant client selection. Using CKKS with sparsification and obfuscating, FedPHE achieves efficient secure aggregation that allows clients to only provide obscured encrypted updates while the server can perform aggregation by accounting for contributions of local updates. To mitigate the straggler effect, we devise a perturbed sketch-based selection to cherry-pick representative clients with heterogeneous models and computing capabilities in a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. We show, through rigorous security analysis and extensive experiments, that FedPHE can efficiently safeguard clients’ privacy, achieve  2.45-6.56\\times 2.45-6.56\\times  training speedup, cut the communication overhead by  1.32-24.85\\times 1.32-24.85\\times , and reduce straggler effects by  1.89-2.78\\times 1.89-2.78\\times .}

However, existing approaches use syntax-based features that can be evaded by transformation attacks or semantic-based features which are usually extracted by expensive program analysis. Therefore, to address the scalability challenges of traditional heavyweight static analysis, we propose a graph-based lightweight approach MalScan for Android malware detection. MalScan considers the function call graph as a complex social network and employs centrality analysis on sensitive application program interfaces (APIs) to express the semantic characteristics of the graph. On this basis, machine learning algorithms and ensemble learning algorithms are applied to classify the extracted features. We evaluate MalScan on datasets of 104,892 benign apps and 108,640 malwares, and the results of experiments indicate that MalScan outperforms six state-of-the-art detectors and can quickly detect Android malware with an f-value as high as 99%. In addition, there are also significant improvements in the robustness of Android app evolution and robustness to obfuscation. Finally, we conduct an exhaustive statistical study of over one million applications in the Google-Play app market and successfully identify 498 zero-day malware, which further validates the feasibility of MalScan on market-wide malware scanning.}

	abstract = {The Right to be Forgotten and related legislation mandate that every individual has the right to withdraw their consent to the use of their personal data. These laws and regulations led to the development of a new concept – machine unlearning. Recently, various machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove the influence of data sample(s) from a trained model. However, alongside all the achievements, there are still loopholes that may cause significant losses for the model owner. We found that it might be dangerous to remove the influence of some “well-designed” data samples from a pre-trained model. An adversary may craft some poisonous data and take advantage of the unlearning request to manipulate an unlearned model. In this paper, we exploit the vulnerabilities of the fast retraining-based unlearning strategy and propose a new data poisoning attack to demonstrate the risks they may bring about. The attack is triggered by submitting an unlearning request on adversarially designed data samples, and it enables an adversary to steer a model to a target location in the parameter space. We provide theoretical analyses to show the feasibility of such an attack regarding the gradient of the poisonous data. Furthermore, the experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the attack strategy is effective.}

	abstract = {We analyze to what extent final users can infer information about the level of protection of their data when the data obfuscation mechanism is a priori unknown to them (the so-called “black-box” scenario). In particular, we explore four notions of differential privacy, namely local/central  \\varepsilon \\varepsilon -DP/Rényi-DP. On the one hand, we prove that, without any assumption on the underlying distributions, it is not possible to have an algorithm able to infer the level of data protection with provable guarantees. On the other hand, we demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions (namely Lipschitzness of the involved densities on a closed interval), such guarantees exist for the local versions and can be achieved by a simple histogram-based estimator. We validate our results experimentally and note that, in two particularly well behaved distributions (namely the Laplace and the Gaussian noise), our method performs better than expected, in the sense that in practice the number of samples needed to achieve the desired confidence is smaller than the theoretical bound, and the estimate of  \\epsilon \\epsilon  is more precise than predicted.}

	abstract = {State-of-the-art asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, such as HoneyBadgerBFT, BEAT, and Dumbo, have shown performance comparable to partially synchronous BFT protocols. This paper studies two practical directions in asynchronous BFT. First, while all these asynchronous BFT protocols assume optimal resilience with  3f+1 3 f + 1 3f+1  replicas (where  f f  is an upper bound on the number of Byzantine replicas), it is interesting to ask whether more efficient protocols are possible upon changing the resilience level. Second, these recent BFT protocols evaluate their performance under failure-free scenarios. It is unclear if these protocols indeed perform well during failures and attacks. This work first studies asynchronous BFT with suboptimal resilience using  5f+1 5f+1  and  7f+1 7f+1  replicas. We present MiB, a novel and efficient asynchronous BFT framework using new distributed system constructions as building blocks. MiB consists of two main BFT instances and five more variants. As another contribution, we systematically design experiments for asynchronous BFT protocols with failures and evaluate their performance in various failure scenarios. We report interesting findings, showing that asynchronous BFT performs consistently well during different failure scenarios. In particular, via a five-continent deployment on Amazon EC2 using 140 replicas, we show that the MiB instances have lower latency and much higher throughput than their asynchronous BFT counterparts.}

	abstract = {The emerging technology of Lab-on-Chips has made a profound impact in the field of healthcare, biochemistry, and molecular biology involving key tasks such as clinical trials, drug therapy, DNA-sequencing, among other tasks. In particular, digital microfluidic biochips have found versatile applications because of the simplicity of operations and low operational cost. Unfortunately, the ease of programmability and controllability in these biochips open doors to severe infringement of privacy and security, which in turn jeopardizes the trustworthiness of bioprotocols. The insertion of Trojans in these biochips may result in deadly outcomes and thus, ensuring the security of biochips has become a major challenge so as to prevent malicious alterations, data theft, cybercrime, sabotage, breach of confidence, and vandalism. Conventional techniques for Trojan detection such as side-channel analysis, runtime scan, and reverse engineering suffer from many shortcomings that compromise time, cost, and the reliability of bioprotocols. In this article, we present new countermeasures to protect digital microfluidic biochips against Trojan attacks based on image classification of the running bioprotocol. A deep-learning approach is employed to classify the observed snapshot sequences as good or infected. Our results on five real-life bioprotocols demonstrate that the proposed classifier achieves 98.52% accuracy while preserving the security and functionalities of the digital microfluidic biochip.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the privacy-preserving bidirectional electric power data transmission problem of the smart grid. A privacy-preserving bidirectional data transmission (BDT) protocol is developed over semi-quantum computation with aim to achieve bidirectional sensitive data flow between power suppliers and users. The minimal quantum cost is pursued under practical constraints while ensuring that power sensitive information is not leaked. To achieve the goal, a two-way data transmission protocol is first proposed that combines mutual identity authentication with message authentication for the benefits of enhanced security. Furthermore, for the preservation of privacy, a semi-quantum duplex communication approach is utilized, wherein the quantum state is randomly divided into two parts: teleportation and measurement qubits. The effectiveness of the privacy-preserving scheme against existing attack strategies is also rigorously analyzed. Lastly, simulation studies conducted on the IBM quantum cloud platform validate and underscore the superiority of the developed privacy-preserving BDT protocol.}

	abstract = {Software aging results from aging-related bugs (ARBs) in long-running systems, that usually causes performance decline and system crashes. Since collecting ARB data is challenging due to its scarcity, it hinders the development of effective prediction models. Moreover, existing cross-project ARB prediction methods often ignore project-specific distribution differences and neglect class imbalance and overlap issues between ARB and non-ARB classes. In this paper, a hybrid approach that combines the balanced distribution adaptation (BDA), the improved subclass discriminant analysis (ISDA), and the self-paced ensemble under-sampling (SPE) techniques, called BISP in short, is proposed to address the aforementioned problems. The main idea behind BISP is first to use BDA to adaptively reduce the difference of projects’ marginal distribution and conditional distribution, and then employ ISDA and SPE to alleviate the severe class imbalance together with class overlap. Experimental results obtained for six classifiers and six cross-project datasets show that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches TLAP and JDA-ISDA based on transfer learning, BISP improves the average balance by 34.8% and 2.3% and improves the average AUC by 26.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Compared with the deep learning approach SRLA, BISP can improve the average balance value by 5.1%.}

	abstract = {Recent progresses in asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus, e.g., $\\mathsf {Dumbo}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ (CCS’ 22) and $\\mathsf {Tusk}$ (EuroSys’ 22), show promising performance through decoupling transaction dissemination and block agreement. However, when executed with a larger number $n$ of nodes, like several hundreds, they would suffer from significant degradation in performance. Their dominating scalability bottleneck is the huge authenticator complexity: each node has to multicast $\\mathcal {O}(n)$ quorum certificates (QCs) and subsequently verify them for each block. This paper systematically investigates and resolves the above scalability issue. We first propose a signature-free asynchronous BFT consensus $\\mathsf {FIN}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ that adapts a recent signature-free asynchronous common subset protocol FIN (CCS’ 23) into the state-of-the-art framework of concurrent broadcast and agreement. The liveness of $\\mathsf {FIN}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ relies on our non-trivial redesign of FIN’s multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement towards achieving optimal quality. $\\mathsf {FIN}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ greatly improves the performance of FIN and already outperforms $\\mathsf {Dumbo}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ in most deployment settings. To further overcome the scalability limit of $\\mathsf {FIN}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ due to $\\mathcal {O}(n^{3})$ messages, we propose $\\mathsf {JUMBO}$, a scalable instantiation of $\\mathsf {Dumbo}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$, with only $\\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ complexities for both authenticators and messages. We use various aggregation and dispersal techniques for QCs to significantly reduce the authenticator complexity of original $\\mathsf {Dumbo}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$ implementations by up to $\\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ orders. Finally, we implement our designs in Golang and experimentally demonstrated their enhanced scalability with hundreds of Amazon’s AWS instances. $\\mathsf {JUMBO}$ and FIN-NG significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in (nearly) all deployment settings. Especially, when $n\\ge$196, $\\mathsf {JUMBO}$ can attain a throughput that is more than 4× that of FIN and $\\mathsf {Dumbo}\\text {-}\\mathsf {NG}$.}

	abstract = {In watermarking schemes, deriving the geometric invariants of the multimedia content is crucial for modern watermarking against geometric deformations. The invariants based on orthogonal moments can effectively describe the semantic content of multimedia due to their excellent mathematical properties. Modulating watermarked signals into these invariants can yield satisfactory geometric robustness. However, with the emerging risks posed by generative large models, the current theoretical analysis of the relationship between invariants and watermarking is still limited, and the intrinsic connection between them is neglected to varying degrees when designing moments-based watermarking schemes. To bridge this gap, we propose a set of design principles, including the texture complexity priority principle, uniform zeros distribution priority principle, and invariants conjugation priority principle, and reveal the critical influence of the mathematical properties of moments on video watermarking. Based on the above principles, we also propose a texture-aware adaptive video watermarking scheme based on orthogonal moments. Extensive experiments show that the proposed video watermarking scheme outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking algorithms regarding imperceptibility, robustness, and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Due to the robust representational capabilities of graph data, employing graph neural networks for its processing has demonstrated superior performance over conventional deep learning algorithms. Graph data encompasses abundant features and structural information; however, its large-scale collection is often challenging in practice. This difficulty arises because data predominantly exists in isolated compartments, making it arduous to harmonize information across various organizations or to enable multiple organizations to collaborate effectively while safeguarding local data privacy. In light of an extreme data distribution scenario, where each client possesses distinct nodes with partially overlapping segments yet divergent data features, we introduce a dual-cloud server architecture. This framework encompasses the design of four secure subprotocols: ReEnc (secure re-encryption), SecPSI (secure outsourcing of PSI), SecWeight (secure weight calculation), and SecAgg (secure aggregation). Together, these components facilitate a vertical federated learning framework for graph convolutional networks, ensuring privacy preservation. We provide a security proof for the entire system and extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) illustrates that our Vertical Federated Graph Convolutional Network (VFGCN) surpasses existing privacy-preserving methodologies.}

	abstract = {Generative steganography (GS) is a novel data-hiding technique that generates stego images directly from secret data without using cover images, which is different from traditional steganography. However, existing steganography methods have shortcomings in terms of hiding capacity, extraction accuracy, and diversity of stego images. To address these limitations, we propose a high-performance Conditional Flow-based Generative Steganography (CFGS). First, to achieve exact extraction of secret data in high-capacity scenarios, we hide secret data in the frequency domain to resist the impact of stego image distortion. In addition, to enhance the diversity of stego images, we introduce a novel conditional generative flow model (C-Flow) to generate stego images, which consists of two newly designed layers, the Conditional Attention-based Affine Coupling layer and the Conditional Invertible Norm layer. C-Flow can accurately guide the visual content of stego images through different conditions, enhancing the diversity of stego images. Our approach is the first GS method capable of conditional guidance of stego image visual content, and achieves extraction accuracy of hidden secret data equal to or close to 100% for payloads up to 1 b-per-pixel (bpp). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art GS methods.}

	abstract = {This article provides the first large-scale data-driven analysis to evaluate the predictive power of digital supply chain attributes for assessing risk of cyberattack data breaches. Motivated by rapid increase in the complexity of digital supply chains and related third-party enabled cyberattacks, the article provides the first quantitative empirical evidence that digital supply-chain attributes are significant predictors of enterprise cyber risk. The analysis leverages externally observable cybersecurity ratings that aim to capture the quality of the enterprise internal cybersecurity management, but augments these with original supply chain features that are inspired by observed third-party cyberattack scenarios, as well as concepts from network science research. The main quantitative result of the article is to show that these supply chain network features add significant detection power to predicting enterprise cyber risk, relative to merely using enterprise-only attributes. In particular, compared to a base model that relies only on internal enterprise features, the supply chain network features improve the out-of-sample AUC by 2.3%. Given that a cyber data breach on a specific enterprise is a low probability high impact risk event, these improvements in the prediction power have significant value. Additionally, the model highlights several cybersecurity risk drivers related to third-party cyberattack and breach mechanisms and provides important insights as to what key metrics should be monitored and what interventions might be effective to mitigate these risks.}

	abstract = {Bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation can propagate unfair social representations and may be exploited to push ulterior agendas. These biases raise concerns on the dependability and fairness of models that have become widely popular and readily available for public consumption. Existing works in T2I bias analysis typically focus on social biases. We look beyond that and instead propose an evaluation methodology to quantify general bias in T2I generative models without any preconceived notion. We introduce a suite of three metrics; namely, distribution bias, Jaccard hallucination and generative miss-rate, to extensively appraise general model bias. To validate the efficacy of these metrics, we also introduce a backdoor-inspired strategy, which provides a convenient handle over the extent of bias in a model for controlled analysis. We assess T2I models implementing six widely used pipelines in this domain. Our extensive analysis covers both general and task-oriented scenarios, employing over 105 K generated images. For prior art comparison, it also encompasses social bias analysis. Moreover, we also extend our technique to analyze bias in seven popular captioned image datasets. Our experiments establish that our approach is objective, domain-agnostic and it consistently measures different forms of T2I model biases. To further research efforts into T2I model biases, we have developed an open-source web application and practical implementation of this work, which is available on HuggingFace. All relevant code is also publicly available on GitHub.}

	abstract = {To preserve the data privacy, the federated learning (FL) paradigm emerges in which clients only expose model gradients rather than original data for conducting model training. To enhance the protection of model gradients in FL, differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is proposed which incorporates differentially private (DP) noises to obfuscate gradients before they are exposed. Yet, an essential but largely overlooked problem in DPFL is the heterogeneity of clients’ privacy requirement, which can vary significantly between clients and extremely complicates the client selection problem in DPFL. In other words, both the data quality and the influence of DP noises should be taken into account when selecting clients. To address this problem, we conduct convergence analysis of DPFL under heterogeneous privacy, a generic client selection strategy, popular DP mechanisms and convex loss. Based on convergence analysis, we formulate the client selection problem to minimize the value of loss function in DPFL with heterogeneous privacy, which is a convex optimization problem and can be solved efficiently. Accordingly, we propose the DPFL-BCS (biased client selection) algorithm. The extensive experiment results with real datasets under both convex and non-convex loss functions indicate that DPFL-BCS can remarkably improve model utility compared with the SOTA baselines.}

	abstract = {Malicious applications of visual manipulation have raised serious threats to the security and reputation of users in many fields. To alleviate these issues, adversarial noise-based defenses have been enthusiastically studied in recent years. However, “data-only” methods tend to distort fake samples in the low-level feature space rather than the high-level semantic space, leading to limitations in resisting malicious manipulation. Frontier research has shown that integrating knowledge in deep learning can produce reliable and generalizable solutions. Inspired by these, we propose a knowledge-guided adversarial defense (KGAD) to actively force malicious manipulation models to output semantically confusing samples. Specifically, in the process of generating protective adversarial noise, we focus on constructing significant semantic confusions at the domain-specific knowledge level, and exploit a metric closely related to visual perception to replace the general pixel-wise metrics. The generated adversarial noise can actively interfere with the malicious manipulation model by triggering knowledge-guided and perception-related disruptions in the fake samples. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on human perception and visual quality assessment. The results on two different tasks both show our defense achieves competitive performances and generalizability, indicating that it can effectively resist malicious visual manipulation.}

	abstract = {In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become essential tools in artificial intelligence research. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer remarkable flexibility, high performance, and energy efficiency for deploying GANs. However, the open and reprogrammable architecture of FPGAs, despite its advantages, introduces risks of unauthorized access and reverse engineering. To address this challenge, this article presents a novel approach integrating Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and logos to protect the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of GANs. Our method establishes a closed-loop conversion process where logos are transformed into PUF responses, generating unique identities fed into the GAN to reproduce the original logo. By embedding PUF response information into latent vectors, the generator produces images with embedded logos. Thanks to the uniqueness of PUF, a robust binding of the logo, FPGA, and GANs’ IPR is implemented, allowing verification of the IPR with the assistance of a unique FPGA fingerprint, even when a publicly available logo is used. Experimental results show that embedding the logo does not change the performance of the original GANs, and the logo detection rate exceeds 90%. At the same time, the scheme can effectively resist brute force, fine-tuning and pruning attacks.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a popular paradigm for training machine learning models on data from multiple sources without the need for data to leave their respective locations. Although FL is widely used, recent research indicates its vulnerability to data privacy breaches and Byzantine attacks. Addressing both threats simultaneously remains challenging, as previous defense mechanisms struggle to balance Byzantine resilience, data privacy, and training accuracy. Although combining Differential Privacy (DP) with Byzantine-resilience in FL offers potential solutions, it presents challenges due to theoretical incompatibilities that can impact the performance of large-scale models. Addressing this underexplored challenge, we propose a novel approach that enhances privacy and Byzantine-resilient in FL while maintaining training accuracy. Our method integrates DP with Byzantine-resilience techniques, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that often sacrifice accuracy or even Byzantine resistance. Our experiments carefully analyze the impact of DP noise on training accuracy and Byzantine-resilience, guiding appropriate parameter selection. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior global model accuracy compared to previous competitive methods, even with strong privacy constraints.}

	abstract = {CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a lattice-based signature scheme that is being standardized by NIST as the primary post-quantum signature algorithm. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of optimizing the implementation of Dilithium using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), specifically AVX2 and the latest AVX-512. We begin by introducing an enhanced parallel small polynomial multiplication with tailored early evaluation (PSPM-TEE) to accelerate the signing process. We provide both AVX2 and AVX-512 implementations of PSPM-TEE, demonstrating that our PSPM algorithm outperforms the traditional NTT by 47%–66% on these platforms. Next, we propose a tailored reduction method that is simpler and faster than Montgomery reduction. By leveraging AVX-512IFMA, we further minimize the CPU cycles required for the tailored reduction. Finally, we present a fully vectorized implementation of Dilithium using AVX-512, carefully optimizing most of the Dilithium functions to improve both time and space efficiency simultaneously. As a result of these optimizations, our AVX-512 implementation achieves performance improvements of 2.25×/2.07×/2.20× in key generation, 2.07×/2.13×/2.36× in signing, and 2.20×/2.36×/2.46× in verification for the Dilithium2/3/5 parameter sets, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art AVX2 implementation.}

However, penetration testing is a intricate and time-consuming task, which is usually dedicated to experienced experts. To alleviate and partially solve this problem, we hereby propose an automated Windows domain penetration testing framework (AWDP). First, we establish the test scenario as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then design a simulator for the Windows Domain penetration testing with OpenAI’s Gymnasium. Second, we implement our automated Windows Domain penetration approach with four sequential steps, collecting domain and host information, modeling with acquired data, discovering optimal attack path through Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN), and performing penetration testing actions. Finally, to validate the effects of the proposed method, we conduct tests in real deployed domains. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed models and algorithms in the AWDP framework exhibit robust performance. Moreover, the framework adapts to different environments with rational and efficient estimated attack paths, which eventually enables end-to-end automation of Windows Domain penetration testing.}

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a multi-billion dollar industry 21.58 billion in 2024), so its processes should be dependable and secure. Malicious actors can inject negative spaces, known as voids, in STL files, which can have a devastating impact on a final product’s quality. Current ways of detecting voids use machine sensor or simulation data, and physical verification measures after printing. However, to the best of our knowledge, no method exists for detecting hidden voids solely at the STL level. Void detection at this level is inexpensive, and has the potential to detect voids in designs en masse. In this work, we propose Avoid, a new approach to detect hidden voids. It both detects voids, and assesses their risk of weakening the manufactured part. Avoid performs risk assessment based on the size and location of each detected void. We empirically evaluated Avoid using several large datasets, in total thousands of STL files, each with multiple hidden voids. We found that Avoid is highly accurate, with 97.7% recall, 98.1% precision, and 99% F1 on average across six data sets. Avoid is also robust, scalable, and efficient. We find that high risk voids account for approximately 7% of all detected voids inserted randomly.}

	abstract = {Hypernetwork has recently emerged as a promising technique to generate personalized models in federated learning (FL). However, existing works tend to treat each client equally and independently — each client contributes equally to learning the hypernetwork, and their representations are independent in the hypernetwork. Such an independent treatment ignores topological structures among different clients, which are usually reflected in the heterogeneity of client data distribution. In this work, we propose Panacea, a novel FL framework that can incorporate client relations as a graph to facilitate learning and personalization by using graph hypernetwork. Empirically, we show Panacea achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and speed on multiple benchmarks. Further, Panacea improves the robustness by leveraging the client relation graph. Specifically, it (1) generalizes better to the novel clients outside of the training and (2) is more resilient to various adversarial attacks, including model poisoning and backdoor attacks, which is also proved by our theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {Multi-client functional encryption (MCFE) is an extension of functional encryption (FE) in the multi-user setting and serves as a generalization of multi-input functional encryption (MIFE). The necessity of hiding function when it contains sensitive information, coupled with the widespread application of inner product (IP) in the descriptive statistics, has led to extensive research on function-hiding MCFE for IP. However, these works all rely on pairings and impose serious restrictions on the size of supported messages, as they all use inefficient decryption involving the extraction of discrete logarithms. On the other hand, although Abdalla et al. (CRYPTO 2018) introduced the first inner-product MIFE scheme for large message space as a special case of MCFE, it is not function-hiding. Consequently, existing inner-product MCFE schemes either exclusively support large space or solely achieve function-hiding, with no solution simultaneously achieving both properties. This paper employs an incremental construction strategy to design the function-hiding inner-product MCFE scheme, which does not require pairings. This leads to two main advances. First, we achieve the function hiding for inner-product MIFE even for messages of super-polynomial size. Second, we obtain the first function-hiding inner-product MCFE for large space, where the length of the message is of super-polynomial size.}

	abstract = {Cross-chain bridges connect two heterogeneous and independent blockchains, in which router contracts interact with external modules to perform functions, e.g., locking assets. However, numerous attacks exploit external interaction vulnerabilities (EIVs) in router contracts. Detecting EIVs presents two key challenges: (1) extracting complete data dependencies, and (2) identifying access controls for off-chain entities. Existing approaches, which transform contracts into intermediate representations for analysis, often miss critical execution logic (e.g., path conditions) and data flows (e.g., data flows at the instruction parameter level). Additionally, the path explosion severely impacts analysis efficiency. In this paper, we systematically analyze real-world attacks and extract the precise features of two typical EIVs. We propose BridgeGuard, a static analysis framework for detecting EIVs. Specifically, we present a symbolic dataflow analysis approach to capture complete execution logic and fine-grained data flows. We then identify three common authentication patterns for off-chain entities and deploy a heuristic-driven pruning method to solve the path explosion. We implement an automated analysis prototype. The experimental results show that for analyzing 1,035 wild contracts with an average scale of 15,914 bytes, BridgeGuard achieves 87.4% average code coverage. For detecting two typical EIVs, BridgeGuard achieves F1-scores above 0.93.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a set of methods that aim to apply deep neural networks to graph-structured data. Despite their promising performance on various graph analysis tasks, they might have discrimination towards certain populations when exploited in human-centered applications without fairness considerations. Moreover, extant studies have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, through which malicious users can degrade the predication performance of GNNs. Nevertheless, attacks to the fairness of GNNs are still unexplored. In this article, we analyze the limitations of existing GNNs backdoor attacks, and propose a novel fairness backdoor attack (FBA) method for GNNs. First, we provide the candidate space selection mechanism to select the fair node candidate space using the long-tail distribution, which facilitates the subsequent generation of triggers. Second, we develop the trigger generation strategy to generate fairness triggers by quantifying the deviations between different groups of sensitive attributes, enabling the attack to degrade the fairness almost without affecting the accuracy. Finally, we undertake extensive evaluation experiments on real datasets and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FBA method, including five mainstream models (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GAE, and VGAE), three downstream tasks (node classification, graph classification and link prediction), and two fair GNNs (NIFTY and Fairedit).}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of industrial structures, many factories are deploying anomaly detection systems. However, most existing anomaly detection algorithms are unsuitable for high-noise industrial control system (ICS) environments and constantly changing sensor patterns, resulting in low detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical temporal memory-based online anomaly detection algorithm for ICS, incorporating cumulative distribution functions and Gaussian convolution kernels. We enhanced the encoding process of hierarchical temporal memory, enabling it to quickly fit the physical processes of ICS and remember the system’s previous operating states for anomaly recognition. Additionally, our anomaly calculation algorithm, based on cumulative distribution functions and Gaussian kernel convolution, effectively addresses the adaptability and accuracy challenges posed by high-noise ICS environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the best baseline algorithms. While maintaining good time stability, our method achieves a 9 \\% \\%  improvement in detection accuracy, highlighting its significant advantage in balancing detection precision and time performance.}

	abstract = {Data privacy and security is becoming one of the most important subjects for IT companies, as it has the potential to shift their reputation and therefore influence their value on the market. However, on a large scale, namely in Big Data platforms, securing data may be a major challenge as it can limit the system’s performance. Therefore, finding solutions that enable a compromise between security and performance is a must. In this article, we present a framework called Distributed Cipher Chaining (DCC) which allows the creation of flexible encryption schemes that can offer configurable levels of availability. We also present a local multi-threaded implementation as well as a distributed multi-process implementation and the advantages and applications of each one. We show that our solution is well adapted to large files as it outperforms state-of-the art methods while improving the diffusion rate.}

	abstract = {Fog computing (FC) has emerged as a promising platform for processing delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) tasks. Fog nodes (FNs) are prone to failure, which necessitates the introduction of a mechanism to increase FC dependability. Leveraging a failure-aware task scheduling approach is one way to make FC a dependable platform for IoT task execution. However, the dynamicity, heterogeneity, and execution uncertainty inherent in FC make designing such a system difficult. To this end, we propose a learning-based dynamic fault-tolerant scheduling approach that considers the three intrinsic characteristics of the IoT-Fog environment to improve fog service reliability for time-constrained IoT tasks. The proposed approach provides a hybrid fault-tolerance solution based on proactive, reactive and replication failure handling approaches. It also integrates a dynamic task runtime and energy-awareness in the decision-making to address the dynamicity, uncertainties, and energy consumption challenges in the FC environment. To validate the performance of the proposed fault-tolerant task scheduling approach, we carried out extensive experimental analysis and compared it with several baseline approaches. The proposed task scheduling approach improves fog service reliability, energy efficiency, and resource utilisation compared to baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Light-field (LF) images contain rich visual information and have broader application scenarios than traditional images. However, their complex structure also makes their copyright protection more challenging. Currently, there are few watermarking schemes suitable for LF images, and most of them fail to restore the original image after embedding the watermark. In addition, geometric attacks remain a difficult problem in the field of LF image watermarking. In this study, we propose a multiple reversible robust LF image watermarking scheme based on code division multiplexing (CDM) and quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments (QPHFMs). This scheme embeds multiple identical watermarks into the LF macro-pixel image, and the compensation information for information loss caused by watermark embedding is reversibly embedded into the LF sub-aperture images. The watermark can be extracted and the original LF image can be fully recovered if the image has not been attacked. The watermark can be extracted to verify the copyright ownership of the LF image even when the image has been attacked. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme is resistant to various attacks and exhibits strong robustness.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of technology, cloud computing has emerged as the most popular and promising service platform. A cloud user can delegate heavy computation tasks to cloud servers. To ensure the correctness of outsourced processing (e.g., machine learning and data mining), the cloud server must prove that the processing has been executed properly. However, even without malicious intent, it is possible for a cloud server to produce incorrect results. Consequently, clients may outsource the same task to multiple cloud servers and receive various results, aiding them in selecting the best outcome. To protect data privacy, the cloud server must encrypt the results before sending them back to the user. Yet, processing and verifying encrypted results remain significant challenges. To avoid the expensive computational overhead of decrypting ciphertexts from cloud servers one by one, clients prefer to use homomorphic encryption (HE) to obtain the combined output from a single server. However, existing schemes fall short of efficiently verifying the correctness of computations over encrypted data processed by multiple cloud servers, especially in extracting the results computed by each server. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for verifiable outsourced computing systems. In this system, each cloud server’s computation result is protected by Paillier encryption, and the edge server can verify these results using zero-knowledge proofs and aggregate the verified ciphertexts. The client can extract the combined plaintext through the Base-3 conversion algorithm to identify each cloud server’s results and any non-participating servers. We also prove the security of our scheme and analyze its performance from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Performance analysis shows that our system significantly reduces the client’s workload and is user-friendly.}

	abstract = {The introduction of transformers has been an important breakthrough for AI research and application, as transformers are the foundation behind Generative AI. Transformers are promising in cybersecurity, especially malware analysis. The reason is the flexibility of the transformer models in handling long sequential features and understanding contextual relationships. However, as the use of transformers for malware analysis is still in the infancy stage, it is critical to evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing literature to foster future research. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of transformer-based approaches designed for malware analysis. Based on our systematic analysis of existing knowledge, we structure and propose taxonomies based on: (a) how different transformers are adapted, organized, and modified across various use cases; and (b) how diverse feature types and their representation capabilities are reflected. We also provide an inventory of datasets used to explore multiple research avenues in the use of transformers for malware analysis and discuss open challenges with future research directions. We believe that this SoK paper will assist the research community in gaining detailed insights from existing work and will serve as a foundational resource for implementing novel research using transformers for malware analysis.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a data privacy-protected distributed machine learning framework, but malicious clients can damage it. Byzantine-robust federated learning aims to learn an accurate global model despite the presence of malicious clients. Most current defenses assume that clients have identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) data and thus cannot perform well in canonical non-i.i.d. scenarios. Several non-i.i.d. statistic-based defenses have been recently proposed to identify malicious clients through gradient statistics without any auxiliary techniques. They thus can only ensure robustness under certain attacks with specific characteristics. We propose Sophon, a comprehensive defense using auxiliary data to combat an arbitrary number of malicious clients in both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. cases. Specifically, Sophon first normalizes received client gradients to reduce the dominance of malicious gradients. Then it introduces a dual trust mechanism to assign the aggregation weight for each gradient. The dual trust mechanism estimates the consistency-based and diversity-based trust scores of client gradients and integrates the two scores as the aggregation weight to effectively suppress the impact of malicious gradients. Extensive experimental results on three datasets from different domains, with diverse models and FL scenarios, show that Sophon is robust in maintaining the overall accuracy of the training model.}

	abstract = {Ciphertext retrieval technology has been widely explored with the increasing popularity of cloud computing. Proxy re-encryption with Keyword search (PREKS) can support multi-user retrieval without increasing data owner's overhead, but users can continue searching once they have obtained search rights. It is difficult for a data owner to revoke a user's access rights because the data is stored in the cloud. In general, under the premise of forward and backward security, the user's search permission can be revoked by updating the ciphertext. Nevertheless, this approach may expose user or data privacy to cloud servers. In this paper, we utilize the Chinese Remainder Theorem to generate DO-Authorization and DU-Authentication factors, and realizes the authorization and revocation of a specific single user by adding or deleting authorization items. In addition, we use a designated tester algorithm in the ciphertext retrieval process to improve system security. Subsequent security analysis proves that the proposed scheme can resist the Chosen Keyword Attack and Keyword Guessing Attack. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme has high efficiency, especially in the user revocation phase.}

	abstract = {Anonymous cryptocurrency, as a distributed application utilizing blockchain technology, aims to enhance the level of anonymity in user transactions, but it may also be used for illegal activities. Existing anonymous transaction protocols lack effective public verification of transaction traceability, which means that malicious users have the ability to avoid being tracked by creating counterfeit incomplete evidence. In addition, there is a conflict between the immutability of blockchain and privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and revision of on-chain data is urgently needed. In order to solve above issues, we propose a trackable and editable anonymous transaction protocol TERCT, which is used to trace the addresses and transaction amounts of participants in anonymous transactions and enable editability of transaction content. Compared with previous work, TERCT enables the editability of transaction content while maintaining anonymity and publicly verifiable traceability of transactions. This ensures that users not only can edit user-generated transaction content but also cannot fabricate pertinent evidence to evade tracing. We prove the proposed TERCT protocol satisfies unforgeability, balance, anonymity and traceability. We compare its effectiveness with the original RingCT protocol, Wolverine scheme and Trct scheme by experiments. The results show that TERCT has less additional computational overhead.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has attracted tremendous attention due to its capability to preserve data privacy. In FL, a parameter server (PS) without accessing clients’ raw data can assist decentralized clients in completing model training by aggregating and distributing model parameters for multiple iterations. From the clients’ perspective, exposing model parameters to the PS can still result in privacy leakage. To further enhance privacy protection, differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is invented, in which clients add differentially private (DP) noises to distort their parameters to be exposed. However, the main challenge of DPFL lies in inferior model accuracy due to DP noises. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel algorithmic framework for DPFL, which is called CODP, by cascading and offsetting DP noises between iterations. In existing works, each DPFL client only considers how to protect its model parameters based on the number of iterations to expose parameters overlooking the underlying relation of model parameters in consecutive iterations. The novelty of CODP lies in cascading DP noises from each iteration to its subsequent iteration so that DP noises can be offset in the subsequent iteration, and hence model accuracy can be improved. Additionally, we theoretically prove that CODP can substantially improve the convergence rate of DPFL without compromising privacy preservation by leveraging the most widely used Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, respectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Lending Club datasets to demonstrate that the model accuracy of DPFL can be remarkably improved by CODP with a fixed privacy budget.}

	abstract = {In recent years, generative steganography has witnessed remarkable progress in the field of covert communication. It leverages techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or flow-based generative models (GLOW) to generate stego images. However, these approaches often grapple with the dilemma of achieving optimal steganographic capacity while ensuring the accurate extraction of hidden information. Additionally, the models occasionally still generate low-quality images that are highly vulnerable to detection by steganalysis tools. To tackle the aforementioned challenges and enhance the overall performance of generative image steganography, this paper proposes the deterministic guided additive diffusion model for generative image steganography (DGADM-GIS). Initially, we devise a reversible mapping function that is used for deterministic guided by a provided secret message, and then construct a secret latent Gaussian vector. Moreover, the proposed DGADM-GIS framework designs an additive sampling method based on the superposition principle of normal distribution to obtain a Gaussian vector that satisfies independent, random and obeys the standard normal distribution, which is transformed to a stego image in a way of maintaining the distribution by the diffusion model. Furthermore, we conduct error analysis experiments on our proposed scheme and derive methods to enhance the accuracy of secret information extraction. The experimental results show that our proposed steganographic method exhibits robust resistance to steganalysis. When embedding 3 bits of secret information per pixel, it achieves nearly 100% extraction accuracy.}

	abstract = {In digital forensics, the provenance of data being used as digital evidence in court is frequently challenged. This is often done to raise doubts about whether the possession of some piece of illegal data was intentional. However, there may also be situations where the provenance of data is legitimately questioned, such as in the case of second-hand devices that were not well sanitized. This may also lead to the disclosure of personal or corporate data. While poor sanitization practices have already been observed for second-hand hard disk drives, this has not yet been reported for new storage devices based on flash technology. Based on insights into the second-hand chip market in certain countries, we report on the results of the first large-scale study on the effects of chip reuse for USB flash drives. We provide clear evidence of poor sanitization practices for USB flash drives from the low-cost market that were sold as new. More specifically, we forensically analyzed 1211 low-cost USB flash drives and were able to recover non-trivial data on a total of 76 devices (6%). Furthermore, we forensically analyzed 435 high-cost USB flash drives on which we could not find any evidence of chip recycling in this market sector.}

	abstract = {Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) in the multi-user setting is designed for scenarios where data owners outsource their encrypted data to the cloud while allowing legitimate data users to search on it. However, existing multi-user SSE schemes are not practical in real scenarios with hierarchical user structure such as enterprises and hospitals. Specifically, most schemes require real-time participation of data owners in the authorization or search process, and are not efficient in authorization adjustment, placing a large computational burden on them. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical authorization in the multi-user setting and propose a forward secure scheme, called DSSEHA. In particular, we develop a hierarchical authorization mechanism where the data owner chooses to share her/his data with specific legitimate users who can continue to share with low-level users, thus reducing computational pressure on the data owner. Experiments show that the computation cost of DSSEHA in search is close to the state-of-the-art solution, while the computation cost in update and authorization (e.g., less than 0.1 ms per document for online authorization and less than 0.6 ms for offline authorization) and storage cost (e.g., less than 50.7 MB for Enron subset with 10,000 documents) are much smaller than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {As an emerging class of internet of vehicles, vehicular social networks (VSNs) provide passengers, drivers, and vehicles with extensive data sharing services to improve traffic congestion and road safety. However, the insecure transmissions of shared data may disclose sensitive information, such as private data, location, and driving route. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising technology to enable secure data sharing, the existing ABE solutions applied to VSNs encounter three-fold deficiencies: (1) the shared data stored in vehicular cloud server would be leaked in the event of key compromise; (2) relying on one or more fully trusted entities to generate keys for vehicles through secure channels; (3) private information leakage and misbehavior of data user vehicles are neglected. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a puncturable registered ABE scheme called PR-ABE for VSNs with enhanced security and practicality. To be specific, our PR-ABE achieves flexible access control and precise data deletion. The former ensures that only registered vehicles with authorized attributes can obtain the shared data. The latter prevents data disclosure when key compromise happens. Meanwhile, PR-ABE enables vehicles to generate keys independently and eliminates the need for any fully trusted authority. In addition, hidden policy and traceability are fulfilled in PR-ABE to protect private information and deal with malicious vehicles, respectively. Finally, the rigorous security proof and performance evaluation demonstrate that PR-ABE is a practical and efficient solution.}

	abstract = {Data integrity auditing technology serves as an essential tool to ensure the data’s integrity with the popularity of remote storage. However, existing data integrity auditing models are unsuitable for a large number of files with interrelationships and heavily depend on a centralized Third-Party Auditor (TPA). To address these issues, in this paper we propose a blockchain-assisted searchable integrity auditing scheme for large-scale similarity data. To broaden the scope of the auditing model and enhance its ability to handle interconnected files, we utilize the keyword to design a search index and a trapdoor to achieve authenticator searchability for the interconnected files. The integrity of the searching result from the cloud side can be guaranteed at the same time. To reduce reliance on centralized TPA and enhance the credibility and transparency of auditing, we integrate blockchain technology along with smart contracts to replace TPA and achieve multitask auditing. We adopt a certificateless cryptosystem to generate the authenticator, while considering the cost reduction. Moreover, an arbitrator is proposed to achieve fairness judge. Theoretical and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure, making it a promising solution for data auditing in a wide range of applications.}

	abstract = {Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a client to retrieve an entry from a database held by a server without leaking which entry is being requested. Symmetric PIR (SPIR) is a stronger variant of PIR with database privacy so that the client knows nothing about the database other than the retrieved entry. This work studies SPIR in the batch setting (BatchSPIR), where the client wants to retrieve multiple entries. In particular, we focus on the case of bit entries, which has important real-world applications. We set up the connection between bit-entry information retrieval and set operation, and propose a closed-box construction of BatchSPIR from Private Set Intersection (PSI). By applying an efficient PSI protocol with asymmetric set sizes, we obtain our BatchSPIR protocol named  \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR} \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR} . We also introduce several optimizations for the underlying PSI. These optimizations improve the efficiency of our concrete BatchSPIR construction as well as the PSI protocol. We implement  \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR} \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR}  and compare the performance with the state-of-the-art PIR protocol in the batch setting. Our experimental results show that  \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR} \\mathsf{BitBatSPIR}  not only achieves a stronger security guarantee (symmetric privacy) but also has a better performance for large databases, especially in the Wide Area Network (WAN) setting.}

	abstract = {The synergy between virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL)-based cybersickness detection models, has ushered in unprecedented advancements in immersive experiences by automatically detecting cybersickness severity and adaptively various mitigation techniques, offering a smooth and comfortable VR experience. While this DL-enabled cybersickness detection method provides promising solutions for enhancing user experiences, it also introduces new risks since these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks; a small perturbation of the input data that is visually undetectable to human observers can fool the cybersickness detection model and trigger unexpected mitigation, thus disrupting user immersive experiences (UIX) and even posing safety risks. In this article, we present a new type of VR attack, specifically a cybersickness attack, which successfully prevents the triggering of cybersickness mitigation by deceiving DL-based cybersickness detection models and significantly hinders the UIX. Next, we propose a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-guided cybersickness attack detection framework to detect such attacks in VR, ensuring UIX and a comfortable VR experience. We evaluate the proposed attack and detection framework using two state-of-the-art open-source VR cybersickness datasets: the Simulation 2021 dataset and the Gameplay dataset. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implement the attack and the XAI-based detection using a custom-built testbed with a VR roller coaster simulation, utilizing an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and conduct a user study. Our study shows that such an attack can dramatically hinder the UIX. However, our proposed XAI-guided cybersickness attack detection can successfully detect cybersickness attacks and trigger the proper mitigation, effectively reducing VR cybersickness.}

	abstract = {Over the past decades, Sequence Similarity Query (SSQ) has been widely used in genomic analysis. Several privacy-preserving SSQ schemes have been proposed to protect sensitive genomic data but struggle to balance security and efficiency. This paper proposes a Privacy-preserving Genomic SSQ (PGSSQ) scheme to address the above issue. Specifically, we first design two fundamental privacy-preserving genomic matching methods, Edit-distance Threshold Match ( \\mathsf {ETM} \\mathsf {ETM} ) and Dual-Threshold Match ( \\mathsf {DTM} \\mathsf {DTM} ), to support approximate edit-distance based threshold SSQ matches and range-constrained SSQ matches on encrypted high-dimensional genomic sequences, respectively. Then, we present a genetic index structure called Genomic Evaluation Tree (GE-Tree) based on the  \\mathsf {ETM} \\mathsf {ETM}  and  \\mathsf {DTM} \\mathsf {DTM} . GE-Tree enables dynamic pruning of query paths without disclosing any genomic information from encrypted nodes, thereby supporting privacy-preserving SSQ on encrypted genomic data with sublinear computational complexity. Security analysis proves that PGSSQ is secure under selective chosen-plaintext attacks. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that PGSSQ is efficient compared to state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Documents are ubiquitous vehicles for information transmission. Beyond the visible content meant for reading, there is a growing interest in hiding additional information in documents. Recent studies have focused on the utilization of glyphs, which are stored in vector format within computer systems. Specifically, glyph variants are manually designed to substitute the original ones in documents, thereby representing information. However, such strategies are costly, only effective for specific font types, and fragile to physical distortions. To address these limitations, this article presents AutoStegaFont+, a two-stage and dual-modality learning framework designed to synthesize glyph vectors capable of conveying hidden information under real-world distortions. In the first stage, we jointly train an encoder and a decoder with a specialized distortion layer to achieve robust information encoding and decoding of glyph images. Then, the second stage employs a differentiable rasterizer to transfer the information from encoded glyph images to corresponding vectors, enabling the automatic generation of encoded vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robust performance of AutoStegaFont+ across a variety of real-world scenarios, including screenshots, print-camera shooting, and screen-camera shooting, while maintaining compatibility with diverse font types. Additionally, we investigate the information-carrying capacity of individual glyphs, exploring their impact on robustness and visual quality.}

	abstract = {Private learning for vertical decision trees (PVDT) is an emerging paradigm that allows multiple parties to execute cooperative training and inference of decision trees on vertically partitioned datasets, without revealing either party's data or model. The state-of-the-art PVDT schemes employ the secret-sharing-based secure multi-party computation (MPC) to admit low computational cost and low bandwidth. Nevertheless, existing schemes need many communication rounds for computing concrete protocols in PVDT, like the less-than comparison, division, etc. This property is not suited for large-communication-latency networks such as WAN. In this work, we present a two-party PVDT framework, called Swan, to enable a secure, accurate, and fast realization of vertical decision trees. At the core of Swan, we design a secure and parallel protocol for  N N -input multiplication with one communication round. This forms the cornerstone for a series of secure and communication-efficient computation protocols specifically tailored to less-than comparison and division. Along the way, we use these optimized protocols to refine the training and inference processes of PVDT, achieving a significant reduction in both communication costs and rounds. Experimental results show Swan provides top-notch accuracy, and achieves a  10.2\\times 10.2\\times  and  2.8\\times 2.8\\times  improvement in online training and inference latency over WAN compared to prior art.}

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective paradigm for large-scale data collection and statistical analysis. However, the paramount concern about worker privacy has driven the development of privacy-preserving statistical analysis methods. We propose PSAC, a novel framework that leverages histograms to facilitate privacy-preserving statistical analysis in crowdsourcing. PSAC integrates secure statistical analysis protocols based on homomorphic encryption and secure two-party computation, addressing the limitations of a single cryptographic technique. It introduces innovative algorithms using histograms for statistical operations, including functions such as quantile estimation, outlier elimination, contingency table construction for  \\chi ^{2} \\chi ^{2}  test, and the Mann-Whitney  U U  test. These algorithms exhibit minimal overhead growth with respect to data volume, demonstrating exceptional scalability for large numbers of data. Moreover, through a key-separation design, PSAC ensures that only the requester can decrypt the final results independently, even if the ciphertexts of data are exposed. Comprehensive evaluations validate the security, efficiency, and scalability of the PSAC framework.}

	abstract = {Edge storage presents a viable data storage alternative for application vendors (AVs), offering benefits such as reduced bandwidth overhead and latency compared to cloud storage. However, data cached in edge computing systems is susceptible to intentional or accidental disturbances. This paper proposes a decentralized integrity auditing scheme to safeguard data integrity and counter the traditional reliance on centralized third-party auditors (TPA), which are unfit for distributed systems. Our novel approach employs edge servers (ES) as mutual auditors, eliminating the need for a centralized entity. This decentralization minimizes potential collusion with malicious auditors and biases in audit outcomes. Using a strategic game model, we demonstrate that ESs are more motivated to audit each other than TPAs. The auditing process is addressed as a Nash Equilibrium problem, assuring accurate integrity proof through incentives for ESs. Our scheme's security and performance are rigorously assessed, showing it is secure within the random oracle model, offers improved speed, and is cost-effective compared to existing methods. It also significantly reduces computational and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Perturbation-based privacy-preserving truth discovery requires the Service Provider (SP) to calculate the truthful aggregation result from perturbed data of the Data Sources (DSs), which inevitably damages the aggregation accuracy due to perturbation noise added in the data. Thus, the existing works attempt to relieve the perturbation errors by reducing noise amounts or adjusting aggregation weights of DSs. However, the former sacrifices DSs’ privacy preservation and the latter has the limited accuracy recovery performance. Aiming at it, we propose an accuracy-enabling differential privacy-preserving truth discovery consisting of an independence-guaranteed data perturbation module and a progressive-private noise elimination module. Specifically, in the first module, SP generates mass of noises following DS's desired perturbation parameters and DS privately obtains one of noise based on private information retrieval. Meanwhile, to realize the perturbation's traceability, SP preserves the ciphertext of DSs’ acquired noises, assisting the following noise elimination. In the second module, SP first removes his preserved DS's encrypted noise from perturbed truth according to homomorphic encryption, and then requires DS to decrypt this cleaned truth. The above two processes are progressively and iteratively implemented until all DSs have been involved. Theoretical analysis shows that our scheme can protect DSs’ raw data privacy in both truth discovery process and noise elimination process. Extensive experiments using the real-world dataset demonstrate that our scheme can effectively eliminate more than 90% of the perturbation noise effects on the truth discovery accuracy.}

	abstract = {Data breaches are the most common security challenges in cloud databases. Due to the lack of control over the underlying infrastructure of cloud databases, data owners can only rely on the trustworthiness and management capabilities of the cloud service provider for data security. This work introduces EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  – a novel encrypted database specifically designed for cloud scenarios. The primary focus of EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  is to address the vulnerabilities inherented in cloud service environments, particularly those posed by malicious entities with control over the software stack. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and freshness of data. The system architecture of EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  integrates a secure B+ Merkle tree structure along with a so-called unique transaction commit process. This process combines a trusted monotonic counter with redo logs to ensure robustness against rollback attacks while maintaining database durability. According to commonly used database benchmarks, EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  achieves strong security with low overhead, addressing a crucial gap in existing cloud database solutions. Compared to the widely adopted FieldEnc implementation (AE, SIGMOD’20, StealthDB, PoPETs’19, and Operon, VLDB’22), EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  demonstrates superior performance with a 1.16× throughput, a 0.85× average latency. Besides, the disk space utilized by EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  is only 10% of that used by FieldEnc w.r.t. the same dataset. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, EncDB-FR ^{3} ^{3}  is the only disk-based encrypted relational database that can withstand rollback attacks.}

	abstract = {While branch predictors play a crucial role in high-performance processors, they are easy targets for micro-architectural attacks. A promising direction to counter these attacks is to randomize the branch predictor's state periodically to create moving targets for the attacker. While such approaches have been successfully applied to mitigate similar attacks in cache memories, applying them in branch predictors offers a unique set of challenges. Unlike cache memories, branch predictors differ widely in architecture. Their proximity to the processor's pipeline requires the countermeasures to be highly efficient to minimize overheads. In this article, we present a systematic analysis of the moving target countermeasure on branch predictors. To capture different branch predictor architectures, we propose a generic branch predictor model. We use the model to formally define various attack strategies on branch predictors and then use the attack complexities to systematically derive randomization intervals for various mitigation techniques. We then identify the appropriate mitigation to be applied for a branch predictor based on the performance overheads incurred. For evaluation, we instantiate five different branch predictors from the generic predictor model and adapt the attack models and randomization techniques for each predictor. We compute the randomization interval for mitigation strategies and show that the interval intricately depends on the branch predictor architecture and the mitigation technique. We study the performance and area overheads by extending the branch predictor in an OpenRISC processor, enhanced with the randomization countermeasure.}

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have cultivated impressive semantics capabilities and expert knowledge from their vast pre-training corpora, especially showing prospects in automated software testing. However, LLMs are designed for human interaction, which poses the following challenges when interacting with programs for testing: 1) LLMs cannot communicate directly with programs, and there is no existing paradigm to establish interaction between them. 2) Existing evaluation methods are unable to assess the quality of LLM-generated tests during software testing. 3) Current LLM-guided testing generation cannot be optimized in real time, resulting in low testing efficiency. To address these challenges, we present PILLM, a program interoperable LLM scheme. First, we designed a prompt mechanism for interactive program testing based on the source code semantics and expert knowledge from the LLM. Second, we proposed an evaluation mechanism for the PILLM's test code generation, thus obtaining test seeds that are semantically related to the corresponding source code. Third, PILLM optimizes the next generated tests based on the coverage and source code execution information obtained in the program execution. In the 24-hour running experiment, PILLM improved the coverage by 45.7% and 14.9% compared to Fuzz4all and Fuzzilli respectively. PILLM proves its effectiveness by finding four new real-world bugs in the JavaScript engine. We have released the source code of PILLM as open source on Github.}

	abstract = {Due to the inevitable information loss during IR lowering, compile-time metadata collection can provide more precise auxiliary information than binary analysis to achieve reliable fine-grained randomization. However, existing schemes build on deep modifications of compilers, making it challenging to provide consistent randomization protection for different high-level languages. Additionally, they are inadequate for securing widely used smartphones and embedded devices, since only x86-64 applications are currently supported. In this paper, we present MLARandom, a compiler-assisted function-level randomization scheme designed for Multi-Language ARM64 applications. MLARandom employs a lightweight compilation standardization strategy that allows for uniform information collection at the assembly level, regardless of the high-level language or compiler used. Further, it combines ARM64 architecture specifications and collected relocation types to accurately repair all ARM64 pointers after randomization. Our experimental results show that MLARandom can equally randomize modules developed in different languages (e.g., C/C++, Rust, Fortran, Cangjie) with negligible runtime overhead (0.51%), to effectively counter against traditional Code Reuse Attacks as well as advanced Cross-Language Attacks. Although randomization approaches based on reassembly can achieve similar goals, our empirical evaluation highlights the imprecise pointer identification as a major obstacle to their practical deployment.}

Prior research has explored methods for verifying the correctness of aggregation in this context and mitigating the overhead associated with the verification process. Nonetheless, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their parameters numbering in the billions, presents ongoing challenges in devising efficient verification mechanisms in FL for large models. In this paper, we propose an innovative Efficient Verifiable Federated Learning scheme  {\\sf LaVFL} {\\sf LaVFL} , which focusing on addressing the verification challenges incurred by LLM.

Additionally, to minimize computational and communication overheads, we propose an efficient verification strategy PGS, namely, a Probabilistic Gradient Sampling strategy, which aims to reduce the gradient dimensions for each round of verification while ensuring a high probability of comprehensive verification. We implement a prototype of  {\\sf LaVFL} {\\sf LaVFL} , and extensive experimental results demonstrate that  {\\sf LaVFL} {\\sf LaVFL}  achieves over a  300 \\times 300 \\times  speedup in the aggregation verification phase and reduces communication overheads by more than 75%, compared to VeriFL under the same experimental setup.}

	abstract = {In this article, we present 5Ghoul, a framework to systematically discover and replicate security vulnerabilities on arbitrary 5G edge devices (UE). At the core of 5Ghoul is a stateful fuzzing strategy that provides full control to arbitrarily manipulate any packet down to the data link layer. Moreover, 5Ghoul automatically constructs the protocol state machines to guide the fuzzing process and employs novel strategies to reliably exploit vulnerabilities on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) UEs over-the-air. The design choices in 5Ghoul were carefully taken to allow packet manipulation in real-time, which, in turn allowed us to fuzz down to data link layer. As of today, we have evaluated 5Ghoul with seven COTS 5G UEs (smartphones and USB modems) and one open source framework (OpenAirInterface). 5Ghoul has uncovered 12 unknown security vulnerabilities (14 in total) out of which ten exist in COTS UEs (ten CVEs assigned) from major vendors (e.g., Qualcomm and MediaTek). Moreover, six of these COTS UE vulnerabilities have been confirmed to have high severity. We also won a bug bounty of over 20 K USD from Qualcomm and MediaTek for discovering these vulnerabilities. We envision 5Ghoul to open the door for 5G security testing at scale.}

	abstract = {Modern face detection (FD) systems have demonstrated remarkable performance in identifying human faces, primarily via Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, these DNN-driven models exhibit inherent susceptibility to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks for intentional face obfuscation from detectors. Such obfuscation can serve both malicious purposes (e.g., evading surveillance systems) and benign objectives (e.g., protecting personal privacy). Previous studies have developed techniques to compromise the effectiveness of various FD models, yet these adversarial attacks are largely confined to the digital domain—e.g., by applying adversarial perturbations to digital input images—or demand prior knowledge of the target FD systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for evading black-box face detection (FD) systems in real-world scenarios. The proposed method relies on the Expectation over Attention (EoA) algorithm, which generates the Public Attention Heat Map (PAHM) by fusing attention mechanisms across an ensemble of publicly available FD models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that EoA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in white-box settings and demonstrates strong cross-model transferability in black-box scenarios, effectively evading FD systems across smartphones, laptops, and surveillance cameras.}

	abstract = {In the developing field of visual object tracking, the robustness and resilience of detection modules against adversarial perturbations is critical. Traditional attacks have shown limitations in maintaining long-term deception, which is mainly reflected in that they are often only effective for a short period of time, or only have an impact on a specific single frame of images, rather than continuously and effectively mislead objects in continuous video sequences. Therefore, the tracker tends to quickly recover to the correct tracking state in the face of continuously changing adversarial attacks, showing robustness against occasional detection anomalies. In order to solve these problems, we propose Multi-Strategy Adversarial Attack (MSAA). MSAA imposes specific constraints on the decision-making ability of the model, regulating the priority of modification to candidate bounding boxes, including offset and size. In addition, the strategy to construct a predefined hijacking trajectory includes a direction-aware perturbation and a center matching scheme to hijack the feature-aware module to a predefined target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a unified perspective is adopted to address the problem from diffuse deviation to target hijacking. Our method not only enhances the persistence and concealment of attacks, but also achieves more precise control in multi-target scenarios, which has not been fully addressed in traditional adversarial attack methods. Experiments show that MSAA greatly outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods on multiple public datasets.}

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain-based decentralized mobile crowdsensing systems have emerged to eliminate traditional centralized trust and to achieve transparent task assignments via smart contracts. It allows workers to select tasks freely, thereby maximizing their benefits. However, prior designs rarely considered the globally optimal task assignment that significantly impacts the efficiency and quality of task performance, like maximizing the task completion ratio and minimizing the total travel distance of workers. So in this paper, we propose DCrowd, a new blockchain-based mobile crowdsensing system, to realize the decentralized, transparent, and globally optimal task assignment. In brief, we first introduce the Proof of Task Assignment consensus mechanism. This allows miners to conduct globally optimal task assignments off-chain, leverages smart contracts to perform lightweight verification for task assignment results on-chain, and stores the globally optimal task assignment in a customized block. Then, we devise the Weight-Prioritized Task Selection strategy and Threshold-based Adaptive Minimum Cost Flow algorithm, to further optimize the system performance and guide miners in competing for minting rights. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets indicate that DCrowd can reduce the broadcast and consensus latency by over 50% and improve the throughput by over 87% compared with existing systems.}

	abstract = {Image forgery detection aims to detect and locate forged regions in an image. Most existing forgery detection algorithms formulate classification problems to classify pixels into forged or pristine. However, the definition of forged and pristine pixels is only relative within one single image, e.g., a forged region in image A is actually a pristine one in its source image B (splicing forgery). Such a relative definition has been severely overlooked by existing methods, which unnecessarily mix forged (pristine) regions across different images into the same category. To resolve this dilemma, we propose the FOrensic ContrAstive cLustering (FOCAL) method, a novel, simple yet very effective paradigm based on soft contrastive learning and unsupervised clustering for the image forgery detection. Specifically, FOCAL 1) designs a soft contrastive learning (SCL) to supervise the high-level forensic feature extraction in an image-by-image manner, explicitly reflecting the above relative definition; 2) employs an on-the-fly unsupervised clustering algorithm (instead of a trained one) to cluster the learned features into forged/pristine categories, further suppressing the cross-image influence from training data; and 3) allows to further boost the detection performance via simple feature-level concatenation without the need of retraining. Extensive experimental results over six public testing datasets demonstrate that our proposed FOCAL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors by big margins: +24.8% on Coverage, +18.9% on Columbia, +17.3% on FF++, +15.3% on MISD, +15.0% on CASIA and +10.5% on NIST in terms of IoU (see also Fig. 1). The paradigm of FOCAL could bring fresh insights and serve as a novel benchmark for the image forgery detection task.}

	abstract = {This paper seeks to enhance the performance of large-scale leader-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems by proposing a novel Group BFT scheme. The scheme utilizes a two-round message transmission process to distribute the load from a single leader across multiple replicas by dividing the entire consensus network into groups, each with an equal number of replicas. Each group has a leader to process the group’s voting messages into a single aggregated voting message during the first round, which is then transmitted to the consensus leader in the second round (similar process for proposing). We establish a formal system framework for Group BFT protocols with a versatile set of base components and explicit definitions, addressing the challenges inherent in designing such a system. We further design and implement two highly efficient Group BFT protocols: one that supports inter-group member exchange and the other one that does not. We theoretically prove the safety, liveness, and responsiveness of the Group BFT protocols. We conduct a formal analysis of Group BFTs’ tolerance and complexity. Experimental results show that the two Group BFT protocols significantly alleviate the processing bottlenecks of the leader and highly improve throughput in large-scale systems.}

	abstract = {Transient execution attacks (TEAs) are a serious threat to modern computing systems. While software/hardware hardening techniques have been proposed to mitigate the threat, developing detection techniques remains imperative, as they hold promise for flexible extension to address new variants, ease of deployment, and minimal system impact. Existing detection techniques face the following three limitations: unstable information sources, lack of explanation for attack scenarios, and limited training data. To address the limitations, we propose InstPro, a TEA detection system that identifies a TEA program while providing an explanation of the attack scenario, based on instruction execution traces. Specifically, InstPro first extracts principled clues that represent instruction sequences semantically close to attack abstraction. These clues provide high-level visualizations of TEA steps. Then, InstPro correlates the clues into a clue provenance graph by reasoning about their causal dependencies, which provides a concise provenance representation. Finally, InstPro reconstructs a scenario graph by using the InfoSubgraphs that represent the information flows among principled clues. These InfoSubgraphs are more likely to capture a set of crucial principled clues that work together to represent the attack scenario. Our evaluations based on 5 datasets show that InstPro effectively performs TEA detection and investigation.}

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports are factual records compiled by security analysts through their observations of threat events or their own practical experience with attacks. In order to utilize CTI reports for attack detection, existing methods have attempted to map the content of reports onto system-level attack provenance graphs to clearly depict attack procedures. However, existing studies on constructing graphs from CTI reports suffer from problems such as weak Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, discrete and fragmented graphs, and insufficient attack semantic representation. Therefore, we propose a system called CRUcialG for the automated reconstruction of Attack Scenario Graphs (ASGs) by CTI reports. First, we use NLP models to extract systematic attack knowledge from CTI reports to form preliminary ASGs. Then, we propose a four-phase attack rationality validation framework from the tactical phase with attack procedure to evaluate the reasonability of ASGs. Finally, we implement the relation repair and phase supplement of ASGs by adopting a serialized graph generation model. We collect a total of 10,607 CTI reports and generate 5,761 complete ASGs. Experimental results on CTI reports from 30 security vendors and DARPA show that the similarity of ASG reconstruction by CRUcialG can reach 84.54%. Compared with SOTA (EXTRACTOR and AttackG), the recall of CRUcialG (extraction of real attack events) can reach 88.13% and 94.46% respectively, which is 40% higher than SOTA on average. The F1-score of attack phase validation is able to reach 90.04%.}

	abstract = {Sketch demonstrates good properties in spread estimation over network measurements, providing fast processing and accurate estimation under limited memory usage. However, most current methods remain limited to single-flow spread estimation, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to range spread estimation that requires measuring the spread of a range of flows. In this paper, we propose LocalSketch, a novel sketch that achieves both high estimation accuracy and memory efficiency for range spread estimation with provable theoretical guarantees. LocalSketch has two key innovations: (1) local key aggregation within predefined ranges that eliminates duplicate spread information through locality correlation, and (2) adaptive counter sizing that dynamically allocates memory resources for large-spread ranges while maintaining compact representations for low-spread ranges. LocalSketch also features an efficient abnormal bucket detection mechanism by comparing identification sign, avoiding exhaustive bucket traversal during super range detection. Moreover, the main idea of LocalSketch can be adapted to existing plug-in spread counters, which has been experimentally proved. We provide a theoretical analysis of estimation accuracy and conduct comprehensive evaluations using real-world network traffic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that LocalSketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving 76× higher estimation accuracy for range spread estimation, while showing 15× better accuracy and 39× faster detection speed for super range identification across all datasets.}

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) enables network visibility and intelligence by providing a global topology view. The controller maintains and updates the real-time topology using the OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP). However, without robust security mechanisms, OFDP introduces new security threats to the network. This article investigates the security threats of OFDP packets, focusing specifically on their header fields and data units. We propose novel methods to implement existing attacks and bypass current defenses. In addition, we identify two new vulnerabilities that allow for the manipulation of link information and the exhaustion of network resources. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks. Our findings have been responsibly disclosed to Floodlight, and two CVEs (CVE-2024-57672 and CVE-2024-57673) were assigned. To defend against such attacks, we design LOFDP to enhance the security of OFDP by thoroughly inspecting the header fields and encrypting the data units. As a lightweight extension of existing controllers, LOFDP can filter malformed packets to prevent attacks, balancing scalability and security. We implement a prototype of LOFDP and evaluate its effectiveness and performance in a simulated environment. The results show that LOFDP can effectively prevent attacks with negligible latency.}

	abstract = {Significant progress has been made in anomaly detection and run-time monitoring to improve the safety and security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and two real-world datasets for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) enables the crowdsensing platform to extract reliable inferred truths from unreliable user sensory data. While mobile crowdsensing systems have driven the emergence of many applications, continuously extracting inferred truths of evolving objects over streaming data (continuous PPTD) remains a challenge. Most existing works focus on static scenarios and cannot handle the new challenges in continuous PPTD, such as accuracy decrease, user dynamics, real-time requirements, and outliers. To address these challenges, we present PTET, a PPTD framework for continuous PPTD. By mining evolving patterns, PTET extracts accurate inferred truths of evolving objects even when some epochs lack sufficient user sensory data. PTET ensures the privacy of both users and data requesters while achieving high accuracy. Furthermore, we present PTET-P for practical applications. It employs a virtual user combined with evolving patterns to effectively eliminate the impact of user dynamics in continuous PPTD. Meanwhile, PTET-P achieves “immediate on-arrival processing” to improve real-time performance significantly. In addition, we address the outliers problem with the help of evolving patterns. We provide security analysis to prove that our frameworks protect the privacy of both users and data requesters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frameworks dramatically outperform the existing schemes in extracting inferred truths of evolving objects in continuous PPTD.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development and extensive deployment of the fifth-generation wireless system (5G), it has achieved ubiquitous high-speed connectivity and improved overall communication performance. Additionally, as one of the promising technologies for integration beyond 5G, digital twin in cyberspace can interact with the core network, transmit essential information, and further enhance the wireless communication quality of the corresponding mobile device (MD). However, the utilization of millimeter-wave, terahertz band, and ultra-dense network technologies presents urgent challenges for MD in 5G and beyond, particularly in terms of frequent handover authentication with target base stations during faster mobility, which can cause connection interruption and incur malicious attacks. To address such challenges in 5G and beyond, in this paper, we propose a secure and efficient handover authentication scheme by utilizing digital twin. Acting as an intelligent intermediate, the authorized digital twin can handle computations and assist the corresponding MD in performing secure mutual authentication and key negotiation in advance before attaching the target base stations in both intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios. In addition, we provide the formal verification based on BAN logic, RoR model, and ProVerif, and informal analysis to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can offer diverse security functionality. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme outperforms most related schemes in terms of signaling, computation, and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection based on system logs plays an important role in intelligent operations, which is a challenging task due to the extremely complex log patterns. Existing methods detect anomalies by capturing the sequential dependencies in log sequences, which ignore the interactions of subsequences. To this end, we propose CSCLog, a Component Subsequence Correlation-Aware Log anomaly detection method, which not only captures the sequential dependencies in subsequences but also models the implicit correlations of subsequences. Specifically, subsequences are extracted from log sequences based on components, and the sequential dependencies in subsequences are captured by Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). An implicit correlation encoder is introduced to model the implicit correlations of subsequences adaptively. In addition, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are employed to accomplish the information interactions of subsequences. Finally, attention mechanisms are exploited to fuse the embeddings of all subsequences. Extensive experiments on four publicly available log anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSCLog, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 3.97% in Macro F1-Measure.}

	abstract = {Electronic Health Record (EHR) sharing can improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis and promote the development of the public medical field. However, plaintext medical records expose patient privacy, and it is challenging to share medical records between different hospitals, making it difficult for doctors to securely retrieve medical records and massively analyze the same diseases from different patients. In this article, we propose a flexible ciphertext retrieval scheme in electronic health sharing system that supports multi-patient and multi-keyword medical records retrieval. The proxy free ciphertext retrieval technology based on cloud servers enables doctors to retrieve multiple patients’ medical records simultaneously. On this basis, we utilize the time encoding algorithm to ensure that the trapdoor associated with the old time cannot retrieve the ciphertext index bound with the latest time, so as to realize the lightweight forward security. Besides, the encoding time signed by the deniable signature can avoid forgery by malicious users or adversaries. In addition, the scheme supports evil user traceable and revocable. The security analysis indicates that the scheme can satisfy the keyword privacy, the forward security of updated ciphertexts, and the deniability of time encoding signatures. Experimental evaluation illustrates that our scheme is lightweight and efficient.}

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of machine learning model has been widely used in social networks, drug recommendations, and various other domains. While GNNs provide significant benefits, they also raise privacy concerns such as membership inference attack, posing a substantial risk to the private training data of GNNs. Previous studies have demonstrated that GNNs are susceptible to membership inference attacks, revealing private information about the training graph. However, these studies overlook the challenges of training data imbalance and a small number of training datasets in node-level membership inference attacks. Additionally, they under-utilize the topological features of the graph, resulting in sub-optimal performance of the attack models. In this paper, we find that by using attention mechanism, attackers have higher attack accuracy on the node-level membership inference attacks. This is because attention mechanism assigns different weights to neighboring nodes based on their contribution to the membership inference attack. To implement the attack, first, we tackle the training data imbalance issue through a random selection strategy. Second, we propose a data augmentation method exclusively tailored for membership inference attacks to address the problem of small datasets in node-level membership inference attacks. Next, we leverage the topological features of the graph and introduce two different feature padding strategies in feature processing. Finally, we employ the attention mechanism to assign different weights to neighboring nodes, enhancing the accuracy of the attack. We evaluate our proposed method on three datasets and three different GNN models, and the experimental results consistently demonstrate outstanding performance.}

The availability of smart meter data has led to the demand for sensor-based load forecasting. Conventional ML allows training a single global model using data from multiple smart meters requiring data transfer to a central server, raising concerns for network requirements, privacy, and security. To alleviate this issue, we propose a split learning-based framework for load forecasting. We split a deep neural network model into two parts, one for each Grid Station (GS) responsible for an entire neighbourhood’s smart meters and the other for the Service Provider (SP). Instead of sharing their data, client smart meters use their respective GSs’ model split for forward passes and only share their activations with the GS. Under this framework, each GS is responsible for training a personalized model split for their respective neighbourhoods, whereas the SP can train a single global or personalized model for each GS. Experiments show that the proposed models match or exceed a centrally trained model’s performance and generalize well. Privacy is analyzed by assessing information leakage between data and shared activations of the GS model split.}

A growing number of individuals, institutions, and companies increasingly rely on pre-trained, third-party models made available in public repositories. These models are often used directly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions, since they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe. In this paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat targeting neural networks. We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to embed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction techniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the performance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques. We design our approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such as Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced number of bits is used for the model parameters. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0, demonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine learning framework. Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these new, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope to encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability detection plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle. Commit-level vulnerability detection aims to detect whether the changed code contributed to potential vulnerabilities by the developer when submitting the code, which is also referred to as Just-In-Time (JIT) vulnerability detection. Previous JIT vulnerability detection approaches relied on code metrics and textual features, which were unable to effectively characterize vulnerability-contributing commits (VCCs). Recently, CodeJIT (a code-centric learning-based approach) has been proposed to detect vulnerability at the commit-level. However, CodeJIT still has its limitations: imprecise feature representation, static code embedding, and underutilized heterogeneous information. In this paper, we propose HgtJIT, a JIT vulnerability detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) in order to address several limitations of the state-of-the-art CodeJIT approach. We propose diffPDG to represent code changes and use the CCT5 model (the latest feature encoder pre-trained on a large-scale code change corpus) to embed graph nodes to generate the most meaningful vector representations. In addition, we employ HGT to adequately utilize heterogeneous information of the graph to learn vulnerability features. Extensive experiments have shown that HgtJIT is the best-performing model, with  F1 F1  and  AUC AUC  improvement of 14.6%−37.5% and 12.2%−53.7% compared to the baseline model.}

	abstract = {Trustworthiness is a critical element influencing every entity in fog computing architectures, which raises reliability and security issues for data exchanged between fog nodes and data sources. Malicious entities can introduce incorrect or manipulated information, requiring trust assessment and management. Maintaining trust throughout the fog computing architecture requires robust trust mechanisms, secure communication protocols, constant trust management and evaluation models. The integration of blockchain technology also provides a transparent and traceable environment, enabling the preservation of trust scores and promoting accountability. Indeed, we propose a new way of calculating event trustworthiness by exploiting trust factors such as Dempster-Shafer theory, temporal relevance and distance relevance. As a result, malicious entities can be discovered and trustworthy behavior can be promoted in the fog computing environment. Finally, we prove that our protocol is highly efficient, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and in-depth theoretical analysis that confirmed its security.}

	abstract = {The increasing dependence on cloud-based data processing for industrial applications, smart devices, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) emphasizes the necessity to address the inherent vulnerabilities of multi-tenant cloud environments.The existing research have limited focus at the simultaneous handling of security and reliability in cloud workload management. This article proposes a novel Quantum Toffoli Learning-based Service Management (QTL-SM) model to concurrently enhance both security and reliability during cloud applications processing. The model comprises two main components: (1) a reliability management unit composed of a novel Toffoli gate-embedded Quantum Adam neural network and (2) a security management unit for detecting and mitigating malicious virtual nodes. The former unit proactively estimates resource contention-based failures of physical nodes and manages them by analyzing reliability scores. It then allocates physical nodes to maximize these scores before executing client requests. The latter unit calculates vulnerability scores for each physical node by assessing multiple risk factors to identify potential malicious activities, mitigating their impact by preemptively terminating compromised nodes and connections. This integral approach ensures client requests are allocated to the most reliable and secure computation nodes, optimizing performance and service management. The QTL-SM model was implemented and evaluated using two real-world workloads. The comparative analysis with different model versions and state-of-the-art methods demonstrated its effectiveness in failure analysis and management, resulting in a 59.7% improvement in reliability and a 51.4% reduction in malicious activities compared to models without QTL-SM.}

	abstract = {The integration of blockchain with crowdsourcing improves data security, reduces single-point failure risks, and enhances trust and traceability in the system. However, this integration also leads to scalability issues because of the decentralized consensus mechanism of blockchain. While multiple chain architecture can enhance system throughput and offer functionality extensions, they often require complex token locking and release mechanisms to prevent double-spending attacks. This leads to a significant portion of funds being locked, thereby reducing overall fund liquidity. In this paper, we propose FishboneChain, consisting of one main chain and multiple child chains. Specifically, we address the scalability issue by leveraging child chains to offload the crowdsourcing task result submission and verification transaction pressure from the main chain, while each child chain can deploy various crowdsourcing protocols to enhance the functionality. Furthermore, we design a fund management contract and periodic task settlement mechanism, which allows requesters to lock a single fund on the main chain to manage task status across multiple child chains, thereby reducing the locked fund percentage and improving fund liquidity. Our scheme satisfies the security requirements of a crowdsourcing platform, such as fund security, robustness, and double-spending resistance. Performance analysis shows our scheme can improve the system throughput to 100 times that of the main chain and maintain the locked fund percentage below 20%.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing is a critical technique for uncovering vulnerabilities in software libraries. However, current approaches often struggle with cross-language compatibility and integration with diverse fuzzing tools. We propose EXO-Muta, a novel universal library fuzzing framework based on exogenous mutation. The term 'exogenous' describes a mutation process that operates externally to the fuzzer's core engine, executing within the fuzz driver as an independent component, unlike traditional endogenous mutations tightly integrated within the fuzzer itself. By decoupling the mutation process from specific fuzzers, EXO-Muta achieves unprecedented adaptability across diverse programming languages and fuzzing tools. It leverages static analysis to extract structured data representations and applies language-independent mutation operators at the code level. This design enables seamless integration with various existing fuzzers, enhancing their performance regardless of the target language. We further utilize large language models (LLMs) for efficient cross-language data conversion. In experiments, we evaluated EXO-Muta on 20 real-world libraries across C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, integrating it with multiple state-of-the-art fuzzers including AFL++, libFuzzer, Atheris, and Jazzer. Results show significant improvements in code coverage across different fuzzers and languages, with up to 58% more edges discovered in C++ projects when integrated with libFuzzer, and consistent outperformance in other scenarios (27% on Python, 9% on Java, 6% on JavaScript). EXO-Muta represents a significant advancement in fuzzing technology, offering a universal, language-agnostic approach that substantially improves code coverage and expands the reach of library API testing.}

In security-critical applications, such as anomaly and threat detection, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data is paramount. In this article, we introduce VeSAFL, a novel scheme for verifiable secure aggregation for privacy-preserving FL designed for edge computing environments. VeSAFL decentralizes model updates across edge nodes, reducing dependency on centralized cloud servers and mitigating risks associated with single points of failure. By leveraging multi-server aggregators, our approach fortifies system resilience and reliability against potential cyber threats. To bolster trust in the learning process, we implement a robust verification mechanism that guarantees the integrity and authenticity of local and global updates. Our experimental results highlight the efficacy and efficiency of VeSAFL in safeguarding against active adversaries and accurately identifying anomalous activities. Furthermore, our comprehensive security analysis affirms the scheme's correctness, verifiability, and privacy preservation in adversarial scenarios.}

	abstract = {With the development of information and communication technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant popularity across various applications. As the number of devices surges and data generation accelerates, robust data security and accurate data retrieval have become increasingly important. Fuzzy keyword search provides an elegant way to allow retrieval over encrypted data. Privacy and accuracy are two important factors when applying fuzzy keyword search into cloud storage systems. State-of-the-art mechanisms cannot effectively balance privacy and accuracy, and they even compromise the access pattern. In this paper, we propose SeaPA, a fuzzy keyword search scheme with strong privacy and high accuracy. SeaPA is built on top of two non-colluding servers and integrated with secure multi-party computation. To construct SeaPA, we introduce a top-k document retrieval algorithm that conceals the similarity of search results from identical queries, preventing access pattern leakage. We implement a prototype system and conduct extensive experiments on the 20NewsGroups dataset. The results show that SeaPA achieves higher accuracy, with over 16× speedups in index encryption efficiency and over 9.3× speedups in search efficiency, compared to previous schemes.}

	abstract = {Model extraction (ME) attacks replicate valuable closed-box machine learning (ML) models via malicious query interactions. Cutting-edge attacks focus on actively designing query samples to enhance model fidelity and imprudently adhere to the standard ML training approach. This causes a deviation from the true objective of learning a model over a task. In this article, we innovatively shift our focus from query selection to training process optimization, aiming to boost the similarity of the copy model with the victim model from neuron to model level. We leverage neuron matching theory to attain this objective and develop a general training booster framework, MEBooster, to fully exploit this theory. MEBooster comprises an initial bootstrapping phase that furnishes initial parameters and an optimal model architecture, followed by a post-processing phase that employs fine-tuning for enhanced neuron matching. Notably, MEBooster can seamlessly integrate with all existing model extraction attacks, enhancing their overall performance. Performance evaluation shows up to 58.10% fidelity gain in image classification. From a defender's perspective, we introduce a novel defensive strategy called Stochastic Norm Enlargement (SNE) to mitigate the risk of such attacks by enlarging the model parameters’ norm property in training. Performance evaluation shows up to 58.81% extractability (i.e., fidelity) reduction.}

	abstract = {Vehicle platoon has attracted much attention in recent years for its benefits in improving traffic efficiency, road safety, and energy consumption. In a vehicle platoon, vehicles can take on the roles of either a leading vehicle or a following vehicle, depending on the need. Selecting a reliable leading vehicle is crucial to improve the reliability of the vehicle platoon, and reputation management plays a vital role in this selection process. However, the existing reputation management schemes do not distinguish the leading vehicle's reputation value (LV-Reputation value) and the following vehicle's reputation value (FV-Reputation value), and merge them into a single reputation value, which exposes the reputation management scheme to the single reputation attack, an attack identified for the first time in this work. Additionally, some schemes fail to preserve the vehicle reputation value privacy, feedback score privacy, or identity privacy, and some overlook the security of the reputation management scheme. To address these issues, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Dual Reputation (PPDR) management scheme in vehicle platoon. The PPDR scheme separates a vehicle's reputation value into LV-Reputation value and FV-Reputation value, effectively mitigating the single reputation attack. Furthermore, under the premise of preserving reputation value privacy, feedback score privacy, and identity privacy, the PPDR scheme employs a score difference calculation algorithm to support the weighted average mechanism and the dual reputation management mechanism, which can significantly improve the accuracy of reputation management scheme. It also provides strong security with acceptable computation communication overheads. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation have been carried out, and the results demonstrate that the PPDR scheme is significantly superior than the existing schemes in several aspects.}

	abstract = {Multi-replica storage is an advanced extension of traditional cloud storage that allows data owners to customize the number of backups for file blocks based on their relative importance. In such settings, remote auditing mechanisms are essential for verifying data integrity and ensuring that the cloud service provider (CSP) maintains the pre-negotiated number of replicas. However, existing schemes often expose block positions and backup quantities to the CSP, making users’ data vulnerable to template attacks. Meanwhile, secure deduplication significantly reduces storage overhead and user costs while preserving data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-replica cloud storage scheme that, for the first time, simultaneously supports cross-user deduplication and integrity auditing in the ciphertext domain. The proposed scheme can not only protect data privacy from template attacks but also enable the elimination of redundant ciphertext replicas and audit authentication tags across users at the block level. Formal analysis validates the correctness and security guarantees of our scheme. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness with modest overhead.}

	abstract = {Hardware Trojan (HT) has become an increasing security concern due to the outsourcing of integrated circuit (IC) development. By performing reverse engineering for ICs, researchers can obtain gate-level netlists to detect HTs. However, with the advancement of IC process technology, the netlists extracted by reverse engineering may be incomplete due to various factors, thus compromising the effectiveness of existing HT detection methods. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the testability values of incomplete netlists and identify whether they are implanted with HTs. First, we develop a testability estimation method based on the Range Search Mean (RSM) algorithm, which aims to accurately reconstruct the testability values of incomplete netlists. Based on these estimated testability values, we then propose a density peaks-based detection algorithm to identify Trojan wires and find out the incomplete netlists containing HTs. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, for the incomplete netlists generated based on Trust-hub benchmarks, the detection accuracy rate of our method exceeds 96% even when the proportion of missing information in the netlists reaches up to 1%. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of our method over several existing HT detection methods and provide an in-depth discussion of our method.}

To address both efficiency and security concerns, we propose Horse-MinHash, which integrates a fast, content-defined feature extraction scheme with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof-based similarity estimation method. Our approach significantly enhances computational efficiency while ensuring robust privacy protection by preventing plaintext exposure.

	abstract = {The convergence of aUtonomous aerial vehicles (UAVs) and federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to facilitate artificial intelligence (AI) services with enhanced privacy preservation. However, notwithstanding the inherent advantages of FL in terms of privacy protection, attackers can still exploit inference attacks to deduce raw data of UAVs. The existing studies predominantly assume FL servers (hereafter servers)to be fully rational and have access to all privacy preference information of UAVs (i.e., information symmetry scenario), in the design of privacy-preserving incentive schemes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving incentive scheme for UAV-aided FL in the presence of information asymmetry while considering the serverexhibits bounded rationality. Specifically, a practical UAV-aided FL framework is first introduced to enable AI model training between UAVs and the server with bounded rationality. In addition, based on differential privacy, we quantify the privacy level of UAVs and subsequently analyze its impact on the aggregation accuracy of the server. This scenario entails two conflicting objectives: the server aims for higher-quality local models to achieve better aggregation accuracy, while UAVs prioritize injecting more noise into their local models to enhance privacy protection. To reconcile the conflicting objectives, we develop an incentive mechanism based on contract theory to optimize the server’s aggregation accuracy in the presence of information asymmetry. Furthermore, we employ prospect theory (PT) to the above contract to capture biases in the server’s subjective decision-making process. Besides, we deduce closed-form solutions for optimal contracts under PT and expected utility theory (EUT), where participants are assumed to be fully rational. Finally, simulation results validate the superiority of our proposed scheme in motivating UAVs to share high-quality local models and improving the aggregation accuracy of the server.}

	abstract = {Maude-NPA is a formal verification tool for analyzing cryptographic protocols in the Dolev-Yao strand space model modulo an equational theory defining the cryptographic primitives. It starts from an attack state to find counterexamples or conclude that the attack concerned cannot be conducted by performing a backward narrowing reachability analysis. Although Maude-NPA is a powerful analyzer, its running performance can be improved by taking advantage of parallel and/or distributed computing when dealing with complex protocols whose state space is huge. This paper describes a parallel version of Maude-NPA in which the backward narrowing and the transition subsumption at each layer in Maude-NPA are conducted in parallel. A tool supporting the parallel version has been implemented in Maude with a master-worker model using meta-interpreters. We report on some experiments of various kinds of protocols that demonstrate that the tool can increase the running performance of Maude-NPA by 52% on average for complex case studies in which the number of states located at each layer is considerably large.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to its distributed nature. Existing unilateral defense mechanisms often fail against persistent attack strategies, primarily due to their limited perspectives. To address the challenge of model misclassification on the server side caused by overlooked model similarity drift, and gradient misjudgment on the client side caused by semantic learning imbalances across classes, this paper proposes a collaborative defense framework for federated learning, termed FL-CDF. FL-CDF establishes an end-to-end defense through a bidirectional client-server collaboration mechanism. Specifically: (1) On the client side, an adversarial perturbation-based malicious neuron detection module is introduced. This module measures neuron activation sensitivity by generating adversarial perturbations, and adaptively prunes backdoor neurons exhibiting high sensitivity. (2) On the server side, a multi-dimensional detection scheme is designed, which integrates neuron localization, adversarial sensitivity, and model parameters. By incorporating client-side feedback on malicious neurons, the server performs robust model aggregation. Theoretical analysis verifies the robustness of FL-CDF, and extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness. In the best-case scenario, FL-CDF improves defense performance by 42.5% compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense.}

	abstract = {Microservice architectures offer scalability and flexibility, but due to their distributed nature and complex service structures, raise new security challenges, particularly in detecting DoS attacks. Although addressing these challenges calls for innovative attack detection approaches, developing effective solutions requires large-scale experiments and data collection to create representative datasets. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to support research on the cybersecurity of microservice applications and the development of different methods to detect cyberattacks. The framework comprises two modules: (i) a data generation module that contains the components necessary to create datasets that reflect the behavior of microservices under attack and (ii) a model development and evaluation module suitable for different methods for detecting attacks on microservices. The framework is illustrated and validated by generating realistic high- and low-volume DoS attack data and developing models using supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and a method based on Logic Scoring of Preference (LSP). The results indicate that supervised ML models have the best classification performance, especially with the XGBoost algorithm. Even though unsupervised ML and LSP models have worse performance, they can be used when the attack data are not available or are costly to generate.}

	abstract = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) is an essential data security technique. Most RDHEI methods with secret sharing cannot perform well on the images with low redundancy, such as the complex texture images. To address this issue, we propose an RDHEI method with ( n n ,  k k ) threshold-secret sharing (SS), which is universal for the images with diverse content since it is unrelated with the image content. Specifically, the original image is shared by polynomials over Galois field GF( 2^{8} 2^{8} ) to generate  n n  image shares. Two kinds of reference matrices are elaborated to guide data embedding and extraction in image shares, one for higher capacity and the other for less communication overhead. At the decoder stage, the marked pixel shares are viewed as the unknowns to construct the multivariate linear equation (MLE) and the original image can be recovered by solving MLE. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art SS-based RDHEI methods.}

A salient challenge inherent in this process is the identification of indirect call targets, i.e., indirect callees. Existing solutions all have high false positives and negatives, making call graphs inaccurate. In this article, we introduce CALLEE, an approach combining transfer learning and contrastive learning. The key insight is that, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically identify patterns concerning indirect calls. Inspired by question-answering applications, we employ contrastive learning to answer the callsite-callee question. To overcome the data-intensive nature of DNNs, we use transfer learning to pre-train on easy-to-collect direct calls and then fine-tune with indirect calls. Upon evaluating CALLEE across various target sets, our findings underscored its efficacy, associating callsites with callees surpasses state-of-the-art solutions, achieving over seven to eight times higher performance in both MRR and Recall@5. Further, when implementing CALLEE within two distinct applications — binary code similarity detection and hybrid fuzzing — we observed a marked enhancement in their operational performance.}

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become a smart application for the Internet of Things (IoT), which promotes the industrial enterprises development. The smart devices deploy the IIoT to collect, manage and analyze data through sensors, which are inevitably confronted with access control and secure authentication issues. Attribute-based signature (ABS), in which every signer utilizes an attribute set to sign the message, is a graceful technology to achieve data authentication and anonymous access control. Nevertheless, in some existing ABS schemes, exponentiation and pairing operations are executed. Notably, pairing operations are time consuming and cannot be executed on constrained devices well, e.g. sensors. In addition, these ABS schemes generally need to send the signed message and signature together to the verifiers, which results in additional communication cost. The communication cost is more expensive than computing cost in wireless sensor of IIoT networks, which are unsuitable to IIoT devices. In order to reduce computation overhead and communication cost, we provide a novel pairing-free ABS scheme with message recovery, in which the signed message does not need to be transmitted. Furthermore, we utilize linear secret sharing scheme as access policy, which achieves flexible access control. The presented scheme is proven to be unforgeable and anonymous under the chosen-policy. The security of our scheme is reduced to elliptic curve discrete logarithm (DL) hard issue. The designed scheme is more efficient contrasted with existing ABS schemes with pairings at aspect of theoretical analysis and experimental simulation.}

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and LLMs. The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers’ datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach. In summary, we present a new link stealing attack method that facilitates collaboration among multiple attackers to develop a powerful, universal attack model that reflects realistic real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Fault-induced vulnerabilities have been studied in various aspects. While traditional fault injection techniques easily detect system-level vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, fault executions can introduce subtle potential vulnerabilities that may not trigger any system-level observable behaviors. These are particularly dangerous in cryptography. Using advanced cryptanalysis methods, these vulnerabilities, such as producing faulty ciphertexts, have been successfully exploited and are regarded as great threats to the security of real-world cryptography. In this way, there is a pressing need to study this very area. Our paper generally explores the internals of the fault-induced data-level vulnerabilities, which are subtle vulnerabilities resulting from faults that may not cause system crashes or overt errors but can expose sensitive information or weaken cryptographic primitives under specific cryptanalytic techniques, in cryptographic libraries. We propose a novel framework which can systematically analyze the vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries under different fault models. By employing this method, we identified numerous critical fault locations that could undermine the security of cryptographic systems across a broad spectrum of libraries, fault models, and platforms. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of select case studies, and engage in detailed discussions about the strategies to alleviate such vulnerabilities.}

The framework of the proposed method maps the processes of data embedding and image recovery to a virtual noisy channel for transmitting special flag bits of image content, and then it uses the systematic polar code to ensure error-free transmission for reversible data hiding. On the data hider side, to reversibly vacate room for secret data, the selected bits of the encrypted image are transformed to flag bits and then encoded to fewer parity bits by systematic polar code. On the receiver side, the secret data can be extracted without error and separate from image recovery. To recover the image, the receiver uses pixel prediction to obtain the noisy flag bits and decodes them to the original flag bits by a special channel knowledge-based decoding algorithm with the parity bits. Then, the original image can be recovered by the flag bits. The experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art VRAE methods.}

We propose to use maximal correlation as a privacy metric and show its advantage over the variational method for approximating mutual information. We develop a practical implementation of maximal correlation and derive sufficient conditions under which the data-driven implementation converges to the true privacy metric in the large training sample size regime. Furthermore, we adopt maximum mean discrepancy and adversarial domain discriminator as techniques to regularize the domain of the sanitized data to ensure its legacy compatibility.

One of the most urgent security issues is how to efficiently authorize and validate the ownership to make the NFT ecosystem avoid infringement and counterfeiting. By exploiting linear homomorphic tagging and robust digital watermarking technologies, this article proposes a generic framework for ownership authorization and batch validation of NFTs. Within this framework, the digital artwork creators can authorize the ownership to a buyer before the NFT is minted in the public blockchain. Anytime in the future who questions the ownership of a claimant can initiate a validation procedure to get an auditing report by running a Challenge-Response protocol that supports efficient batch verification. The completeness and soundness of the proposed framework have been proven by assuming a secure homomorphic tag scheme and a robust watermarking scheme. We also present instantiations of the generic construction, especially with  \\Pi _{Pub} \\Pi _{Pub} , one can outsource the validation procedure to the public blockchain to release local computation burden. A series of elaborated experiments have shown our proposed framework is practical and efficient.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of 5 G networks and mobile devices has led to a surge in the generation of private data, creating massive data streams. Securing and continuously releasing histogram data over sliding windows in these streams has become a critical issue, as it enables understanding recent collective phenomena in data streams while preserving individual privacy. Existing state-of-the-art methods require buffering all data from each sliding window to reconstruct accurate histograms, which is unnecessary and significantly hampers efficiency. This paper proposes an online streaming sampling publication framework with differential privacy, named the Publishing Approach with Sliding window estimation-count sketch (PAS), which constructs an approximate histogram without buffering each sliding window and subsequently generates publishable histograms. Specifically, we introduce a novel memory-efficient sketch structure called the Sliding Window Estimation-Count Sketch (SES), which facilitates rapid retrieval of counts within sliding window intervals while providing guaranteed data protection. The output of this sketch structure approximates true counts while theoretically incorporating differentially private noise, thus ensuring  (\\epsilon, \\delta ) (\\epsilon, \\delta ) -differential privacy. Moreover, to improve the speed of histogram generation and reduce processing time in PAS, we propose an adaptive histogram generation algorithm based on SES. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with other publication methods.}

However, maintaining SA requires substantial human effort; security analysts must analyze large volumes of alerts, many of which are false positives triggered by anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Efficiently prioritizing these alerts is vital to enable analysts to focus on real threats without delay. In this paper, we present two key contributions designed to improve real-time SA. First, we propose modeling dynamic alert prioritization as an active learning problem in a hidden Markov model (HMM) with the objective to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the belief. We propose to use the uncertainty of the belief as a proxy for the MSE of the belief, and we develop two computationally tractable policies for choosing alerts to investigate. Second, we propose and evaluate a state space and an exploit space reduction method to reduce the computational complexity of the belief update. We use simulations on synthetic and real dependency graphs to evaluate the proposed policies. Our results show that the proposed investigation policies reduce the MSE of the belief by up to 50% compared to baseline policies, and they are robust to high false alert rates and to investigation errors. Our results also show that state space reduction can reduce the computation time by 85% without a significant increase in the belief MSE.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a promising approach for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, its distributed nature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks, particularly in NLP tasks, where related research remains limited. This article introduces SDBA, a novel backdoor attack mechanism designed for NLP tasks in federated learning environments. Through a systematic analysis across LSTM and GPT-2 models, we identify the most vulnerable layers for backdoor injection and achieve both stealth and long-lasting durability by applying layer-wise gradient masking and top-k% gradient masking. Also, to evaluate the task generalizability of SDBA, we additionally conduct experiments on the T5 model. Experiments on next-token prediction, sentiment analysis, and question answering tasks show that SDBA outperforms existing backdoors in terms of durability and effectively bypasses representative defense mechanisms, demonstrating notable performance in transformer-based models such as GPT-2. These results highlight the urgent need for robust defense strategies in NLP-based federated learning systems.}

This paper analyzes vulnerabilities in Al-Shareeda et al.'s vehicle authentication protocol (doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2025.3553868) and proposes an enhanced ECC-based scheme using short-lived pseudonymous certificates. We identify two critical weaknesses in Al-Shareeda et al.'s protocol—a desynchronization attack causing potential denial-of-service and an identity linking attack compromising vehicle privacy. Our protocol establishes mutual authentication between vehicles and roadside units, ensuring message integrity, anonymity, and perfect forward secrecy. Unlike existing approaches, it eliminates the need for online third-party authenticators. Formal security proofs demonstrate that the scheme's security is reducible to the hardness of the ECDLP and CDH problems. Performance analysis shows our approach achieves an optimal security-efficiency balance with competitive communication overhead (4608 bits) and computation costs (5.02 ms) compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, while uniquely satisfying all twelve evaluated security properties.}

However poorly implemented OTP can lead to vulnerabilities like Bomb attacks (a Denial of Service attack) on SMS or Email, OTP Brute-Force attacks, and OTP bypass, compromising access control. While fuzzing at the application layer (e.g., http) is effective for web products, it faces limitations in mobile applications due to cryptographic complexities and certificate verification. To address this, we propose a fuzzing framework, OTP-Hunter, combining static and dynamic analysis to uncover OTP vulnerabilities in applications with minimal manual intervention. We use OTP-Hunter to analyze 59 IoT-related apps (not limited), identify 68 vulnerabilities and reported them to the vendor and China National Vulnerability Database for 11 CNVDs. These vulnerabilities could let attackers remotely take control of devices by knowing the victim’s cloud account, typically a phone number. Our results also show that compared with mutating the network requests, our approach can cover more circumstances like custom protocol because we do not need to know the encryption process.}

	abstract = {We delve into the complexities surrounding the delegation of encrypted data to cloud services, which often introduce limitations on search functionalities. To overcome these challenges, the concept of fuzzy searchable encryption has emerged, empowering users to search for data that closely resemble, rather than precisely match, a given query. Notably, wildcard search has emerged as a prominent technique within fuzzy searchable encryption, allowing users to search for words or phrases conforming to specific patterns. However, existing wildcard search schemes require explicit specification of wildcard count and/or positions, thereby potentially introducing security vulnerabilities. Presently, a state-of-the-art security-enhanced wildcard searchable encryption scheme known as SPWSE has alleviated the need for explicit specification of wildcard count and positions in search queries. In this paper, we uncover a novel attack on SPWSE, enabling adversaries not only to discern the underlying keyword but also to determine the count and positions of wildcards utilized in the query. This information leakage stems from cryptographically loose coupling in the trapdoor generation process. To tackle this specific challenge, we propose a novel approach to enhance the security of wildcard searchable encryption. Our proposed scheme integrates additional cryptographic mechanisms to fortify its security posture while concurrently reducing the computational costs associated with data encryption, query generation, and search operations. We evaluate the effectiveness and security of our proposed approach through extensive experimentation, comparing its performance against existing methodologies in the field.}

	abstract = {Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provides isolation for sensitive data in electronic devices and its compromise can lead to enormous losses. TEE’s information-flow security is essential and can be robustly ensured by formal methods. Nevertheless, the cross-domain API invocation of TEE is intricate for information-flow analysis, and the service provider on the TEE, i.e., trusted application, brings complexity to the TEE specification and verification. Existing research seldom delves into general TEEs that are compliant with GlobalPlatform (GP), which is an important and universal TEE standard. Furthermore, they do not align with the requirements for Common Criteria certification. In this paper, we propose a TEE-applicable and Common Criteria-oriented framework to specify and verify the information-flow security of GP TEE, which is applied to the verification of the real-world commercial MiTEE. Firstly, we present a framework for TEE that aligns with the requirements of Common Criteria’s highest assurance level (EAL 7). It incorporates a domain-switch based mechanism to model the cross-domain TEE API invocation and a parameterized modeling approach to handle trusted applications. Secondly, we model GlobalPlatform-compliant TEE with the framework as GP TEE security model layer and function layer, which are reusable for all GP TEEs. Thirdly, we specify MiTEE as the MiTEE design layer that refines GP TEE model. Lastly, we verify the information-flow security of GP TEE and MiTEE via theorem proving and uncover four critical vulnerabilities in MiTEE. This work contributes to MiTEE’s acquirement of an EAL 5+ certificate. All works are carried out in Isabelle/HOL, with nearly 32000 lines of code.}

	abstract = {Authentication is a crucial method for ensuring the security of the uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication systems; however, it also raises concerns about the leakage of private data. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the problem of identity authentication with privacy-preserving consideration. We propose a two-way privacy-preserving physical layer (PHY-Layer) authentication framework in a UAV-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, by exploiting the carrier frequency offset (CFO) characterizing UAV identity and CFO-based session keys constructed by elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to encrypt data frames. In particular, we first employ a MOOSE algorithm to extract the hardware fingerprint feature related to UAV, and based on the extracted CFO feature parameters, we devise an ECC-based algorithm for a session key negotiation. To achieve identity validation for the network parties, we establish a two-way authentication framework based on the resulting CFO feature parameters, and apply the CFO-based session key to encrypt data frames for avoiding the leakage of private data. Moreover, we derive the closed-form analytical expressions for the probabilities of the detection and false alarm for the rigorous performance analysis. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to validate the proposed theoretical model and demonstrate its effectiveness in both identity authentication and privacy preservation. In comparison with the prior scheme, the proposed framework has a better robustness and privacy.}

	abstract = {Face-swapping DeepFakes have become an escalating societal concern, attracting increasing attention in recent years. To counter this, we investigate a new proactive defense framework to prevent individuals from being victimized in DeepFake videos. The core idea of this framework is to contaminate the inputs of DeepFake models by disrupting face detectors, based on the observation that face detectors are commonly used to automatically extract victim faces in most DeepFake techniques. Once the face detectors malfunction, the faces will not be correctly extracted, thereby impairing the training or synthesis stages of DeepFake models. To achieve this, we describe a strategy named FacePoison, which fools face detectors by adding dedicated adversarial perturbations to video frames. Building upon this, we introduce VideoFacePoison, an extended strategy that can efficiently propagate FacePoison across video frames instead of applying it individually to each frame, thus significantly reducing the computational overhead while retaining favorable attack performance. This framework is validated on five face detectors, and extensive experiments against eleven different DeepFake models demonstrate the effectiveness of disrupting face detectors to hinder DeepFake generation.}

	abstract = {The network architecture of modern vehicles is composed of multiple communication protocols and electronic control units (ECU). Compared to the widely used protocol of Controller Area Network (CAN), CAN with Flexible Data-Rate (CAN-FD) protocol is suitable for applications requiring higher data throughput. However, the CAN-FD bus is vulnerable to intrusion by external attackers. Nowadays, several secure mechanisms have been proposed to protect the security of in-vehicle data. However, there are still two issues: 1) Most schemes use a centralized controller for key distribution, which can easily lead to a single point of failure; 2) The existing key management modes are not suitable for real-world CAN-FD networks in vehicle manufacturing. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight semi-decentralized scheme based on Database CAN (DBC) files to secure in-vehicle communication. ECUs are grouped on the send-receive relationships set in the DBC file, considering both the communication mode and sending efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed scheme overcomes reliance on long-term keys. Moreover, the security is analyzed by the random oracle model. The performance analysis is evaluated on microcontroller units (MCU) STM32H743IIT and Raspberry Pi 3B. The proposed scheme optimizes the computational costs of authentication, key agreement, and secure communication stages by up to 97.89%, 99.95%, and 82.35%, and optimizes the communication costs by up to 75.52%, 98.42%, and 29.41% compared to existing methods. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the bus load of the scheme increases by up to 9.84% compared to the baseline network.}

However, existing methods typically focus on either representation-level or image-level privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a novel Face Conditional Privacy Funnel Network (Face-CPFNet), a dual-level privacy-enhancement framework with three key innovations. First, it introduces a dual-level privacy protection system where attackers receive reconstructed face images by combining the random guess of the sensitive attribute’s potential label with the face representation provided by the user. Second, we propose the Face-CPF optimization problem, based on the Conditional Privacy Funnel (CPF) and an additional information leakage constraint. A deep variational approximation approach with parameterized deep neural networks is used to solve this problem and develop the Face-CPFNet model. Third, it enables supervised disentangled representation learning for reconstructing face images with variations in generative factors, and further enhances privacy protection by introducing an information leakage constraint when the sensitive attribute is a discrete binary random variable. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that Face-CPFNet strikes a more effective balance between face verification accuracy and soft-biometric privacy compared with existing SBPE and CPF models.}

	abstract = {Determining the origins of code snippets has gained increasing attention due to the popularity of large language models and the concern about their misuse in generating unlicensed or malicious code. Watermarking is considered a working solution for tracing code snippet provenance. However, source code watermarking requires more stringent and intricate rules than natural language or software watermarking, since one needs to ensure both readability and functionality of the watermarked code snippets. To this end, we propose a novel watermarking system CodeMark, featured by variable renaming as the key. Surrounding variable renaming, several challenges emerge such as determining renaming candidates, defining the variable context, and providing diverse variable substitutes, etc. The design of CodeMark conquers these challenges by an end-to-end learning system, which interprets the code context through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and generates natural substitutes fitting the context by distilling from CodeBERT. Experiments illustrate that CodeMark surpasses the state-of-the-art watermarking systems in terms of watermarking requirements.}

To address these challenges, we propose an explainable novel malware defense framework that integrates Markov games with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning under an end-edge-cloud-based SIoT collaborative architecture. The framework models the interactions between malicious SIoT nodes and edge devices as a multi-agent game problem, incorporating multi-layer defense mechanisms to achieve precise descriptions of attack-defense behaviors. By combining Markov games with the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, we develop the Robust Multiagent Actor-Critic (RMAAC) algorithm, which enables adaptive strategy optimization. To enhance system interpretability, we introduce SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis into the defense decision-making process, providing transparent insights into feature contributions and decision rationales. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RMAAC algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, including MADDPG and Minimax Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (M3DDPG), in multiple performance metrics such as episode reward, hacking success rate, and cumulative defense number. Through systematic parameter optimization, including batch size and agent interaction speed, the framework provides an effective and sustainable solution for explainable malware defense in SIoT environments.}

	abstract = {Public data can be authenticated via TLS from trustworthy websites, while private data, such as user profiles, is generally restricted. Users cannot share their username and password to access private data (e.g., addresses) from restricted sites (e.g., utility companies). DECO (CCS 2020) presents a TLS 1.2-based solution that facilitates data liberation without imposing excessive trust assumptions or requiring server-side modifications. In our previous work, DIDO (ISPEC 2023), we proposed an optimized solution for TLS 1.3 websites. We addressed several open problems, including support for X25519 key exchange, the design of round-optimal three-party key exchange, the architecture of 2 PC for TLS 1.3 key scheduling, and circuit design optimized for 2 PC. Our implementation was tested on real-world websites. In this work, DIDO+, we provide a comparison with recent concurrent efforts and offer additional details about DIDO. We also present the NIZK proofs utilized in three-party key exchange under malicious settings. Finally, we introduce a new protocol called selective disclosure, which allows for the disclosure of specific portions of plaintext to the verifier, instead of the entirety.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious updates (e.g., gradients) can adversely interfere with the global model. Existing attacks typically rely heavily on the updates of benign clients and aggregation algorithms to craft malicious updates. However, the benign updates and aggregation algorithms are usually hard to access for attackers, which makes their attacks weak and volatile. Therefore, in this work, we aim to design an adaptive model poisoning attack based on the agnostic adversary. Specifically, we propose a new concept from the perspective of adversarial learning, called adversarial model perturbation. This perturbation targets the parameters of the local model and aims to maximally mislead its predictions. Then, we develop a novel adaptive model poisoning attack named Adversarial Model Attack (AMA), which utilizes the adversarial model perturbation as the malicious updates to attack the global model. Instead of the benign updates and aggregation algorithms, we only leverage the original data of the malicious client to adaptively craft the malicious updates. AMA resolves the conflict between the knowledge requirement of the adversary and the impact of model poisoning attacks. Empirical results against multiple robust FL methods show that AMA surpasses state-of-the-art attack methods and updates the benchmark of attack impact on Fedavg, Trimean, Multi-Krum, FoundationFL, RFA, and Median.}

	abstract = {Text-to-image generative models have gained popularity among both researchers and the general public due to their ability to generate high-quality images from text prompts. However, many of these models rely on pre-trained text encoders obtained from external sources, which introduces significant security risks. Adversaries can implant backdoors into these encoders, causing the models to generate images with predefined attributes, such as nudity, or to produce malicious content when triggered prompts are used. Existing backdoor defenses are ineffective in text-to-image models due to the large number of model parameters, the difficulty of collecting high-quality text-image pairs, and the challenges in defining adversarial behaviors. In this paper, we propose two defense methods: few-shot fine-tuning and history-based fine-tuning. Specifically, few-shot fine-tuning eliminates backdoors by adding words that present backdoor effects to the input prompts to make the embeddings of trigger prompts consistent with those of clean prompts. History-based fine-tuning distinguishes triggered prompts from clean prompts by removing keywords from the input prompts and utilizes only historical data for self-healing. Experimental results demonstrate that both defense methods can effectively eliminate backdoors while maintaining high model performance.}

	abstract = {As a new distributed machine learning framework, vertical federated learning (VFL) has been widely applied in the industry. However, recent studies have demonstrated that VFL faces serious challenges from backdoor attacks, which significantly hinder its further development. Although a few studies have focused on defending against VFL backdoor attacks, these defenses either do not consider the latest attack methods or show limited effectiveness. Moreover, most existing backdoor defense efforts primarily focus on backdoor attacks in horizontal federated learning (HFL) and centralized learning. Due to the unique architecture of VFL models, these methods cannot be directly applied to backdoor defense in VFL. To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks in VFL, we propose a general backdoor detection (GBD) scheme for backdoor defense, which detects backdoor samples by analyzing the correlation between backdoor samples and the target label, as well as by leveraging the response differences between clean and backdoor samples. Specifically, we propose two backdoor detection metrics: Class Activation Probability (CAP) and Class Activation Contribution (CAC), which are used to calculate the likelihood of a sample being a backdoor sample. We leverage these two metrics to identify backdoor samples during the inference stage. Evaluation results on both tabular and image datasets show that GBD can detect backdoor samples with high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in backdoor defense.}

The absence of contract specifications poses a real challenge to the correctness verification of smart contracts. Program invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the execution, which characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, InvCon+, for Solidity smart contracts. InvCon+extends the existing invariant detector, InvCon, to automatically produce verified contract invariants based on both dynamic inference and static verification. Unlike InvCon+, InvCon only produces likely invariants, which have a high probability to hold, yet are still not verified against the contract code. Particularly, InvCon+is able to infer more expressive invariants that capture richer semantic relations of contract code. We evaluate InvCon+on 361ERC20 and 10ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as common ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that InvCon+efficiently produces high-quality invariant specifications, achieving a recall of 80%, which can be used to secure smart contracts from 17 types of common vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) has been widely studied to ensure authentication, anonymity, and traceability in vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs). Among CPPA schemes, certificateless CPPA (CL-CPPA) offers natural advantages for VANETs by avoiding the complex certificate management of PKI-based solutions and the key escrow problem of identity-based systems. However, many existing CL-CPPA schemes overlook secure message communication. When confidentiality is required, they often rely on additional encryption, which adds communication overhead comparable to that of certificate transmission in PKI-based solutions. Anamorphic signatures (proposed at CRYPTO’23) can be adopted to address this issue by embedding sensitive messages within signatures, which eliminates the need for separate encryption. However, existing anamorphic signature schemes are symmetric, requiring extensive key agreements between two entities, which is impractical for the dynamic nature of VANETs. In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, asymmetric anamorphic signatures (AAS), which enables secure message sharing in a public-key setting, thus eliminating the need for complex key agreements. We also provide a concrete construction of AAS based on a variant of the Hohenberger-Waters signature scheme. By integrating AAS with CL-CPPA, we propose Sphinx, a scheme that ensures authentication, anonymity, traceability, and confidentiality without the overhead of additional secure transmissions or complex key agreements. Our security proofs and performance evaluations demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of Sphinx, particularly its advantage in reducing communication overhead.}

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is the most widely used standard in the automotive industry for in-vehicle networks. However, the CAN protocol lacks essential security features such as encryption and message authentication. Absence of such security features has been shown to make the vehicle network vulnerable to exploits by an adversary. Although multiple types of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed for CAN, it can be difficult to deploy them in real-time with low latency. Further, many of these IDSs are unable to isolate specific CAN frames on which an attack has been mounted, which makes it challenging to design defense mechanisms. In this paper, we develop CANLP, a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based intrusion detection system to determine whether each transmitted message originated from a legitimate ECU or an adversary. CANLP uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a NLP technique to discern complex features associated with CAN data and trains machine learning models to identify three types of attacks- fuzzing, spoofing, and masquerade. When an attack is detected, CANLP identifies the malicious CAN frame, which is important for developing resilient systems. Extensive experiments on 4 publicly available vehicle network datasets (which represent data collected from over three vehicle makes and four models) show that CANLP performs attack classification with high F1-scores of 0.9974. We also show that CANLP can be deployed for attack detection on resource-constrained hardware through implementation using RaspberryPi and experiments on a testbed with latency as low as  < \\text{0.05}~ms < 0.05 \xa0 m s < \\text{0.05}~ms , making it suitable for real-world automotive applications such as fleet monitoring within the same vehicle class.}

	abstract = {Digital video inpainting technique has been substantially improved with deep learning in recent years. It may be used as malicious manipulation to remove important objects for creating forged videos. As such it is significant to blindly identify the inpainted regions in videos. In this article, we present a Trusted Video Inpainting Localization network (TruVIL) with excellent robustness and generalization ability. Observing that high-frequency noise can effectively unveil the inpainted regions, we design deep attentive noise learning in multiple stages to capture the inpainting traces. First, a multiscale noise extraction module based on 3D High Pass (HP3D) layers is used to create the noise modality from input RGB frames. Then the correlation between such two complementary modalities are explored by a cross-modality attentive fusion module to facilitate mutual feature learning. Lastly, spatial details are selectively enhanced by an attentive noise decoding module to boost the localization performance of the network. To prepare enough training samples, we also build a frame-level video object segmentation dataset (VOS2k5) with 2500 videos and pixel-level annotation for all frames. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on various inpainted videos verify the robustness against video compression and generalization ability of TruVIL.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving data aggregation (PDA) enables an edge server to securely perform aggregation tasks on data generated by terminal devices in edge intelligence (EI) systems, revealing only the result without exposing individual inputs. However, most existing solutions, such as homomorphic encryption and federated learning, support only basic functions (e.g., SUM or AVG). They often fail to achieve privacy protection, fault tolerance, and lightweight terminal-side operations when the server colludes with compromised devices. In this work, we propose PrivEI, a practical PDA scheme for EI systems. It uses a proposed collusion-resistant symmetric masking scheme that enables an untrusted edge server to collect and decode masked inputs from  n n  terminal devices while supporting arbitrary computations. The scheme allows the server to collude with  k \\leq n - 2 k \\leq n - 2  terminal devices and has a lightweight mechanism to tolerate device dropouts during aggregation. PrivEI further leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem to avoid frequent mask updates when aggregating multi-dimensional data, and ensures data integrity using a signer-efficient multiple-time elliptic curve signature algorithm. We formally prove that PrivEI ensures input privacy and achieves  (n-k) (n-k) -source anonymity. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that it offers superior functionality with performance comparable to existing approaches. We have open-sourced the implementation.}

	abstract = {Many real-world networks can be modeled as decentralized heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes, each holds a piece of whole network and has its own privacy preference. Local differential privacy (LDP) has been widely used in decentralized graph synthesis to provide privacy guarantees. This paper shows that existing LDP-based graph synthesis approaches are insufficient for preserving topological properties and satisfying the different privacy requirements of heterogeneous nodes when generating synthetic decentralized graphs. To address these problems due to the clueless perturbation and ignorance of the topological properties of existing approaches, we introduce HeG-LDP, a novel privacy-preserving decentralized heterogeneous graph synthesis approach that achieves a considerable utility boost compared to other methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of different types of nodes. Concretely, we propose a heterogeneous graph information extraction approach that exploits the inherent topological nature of graphs to construct background knowledge from the partial nodes in a diffusion manner, which is then used to guide individuals in topological information extraction and perturbation. In addition, to further improve the quality of the generated graph, we propose a dK-series-based graph generation approach, which can optimize the connection probability of node pairs via a delicate combination of degree values and dK-series information, resulting in better maintenance of the topological utility. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis show that our proposed HeG-LDP can yield high-quality synthetic heterogeneous graphs while satisfying edge-LDP.}

	abstract = {In the growing trend of remote working, millions of edge networks (e.g., homes or branch offices) are increasingly threatened by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), because of the weakened segmentation between business and non-business devices in remote working environment. Despite the fact that numerous APT detection mechanisms have been proposed, all of them are struggling to handle the complex structure, the massive scale and the diverse topology of edge networks. Can recent machine-learning advances tackle these APT detection pain points in edge networks? The GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) seems to be suited to capture the complex structure, but its adjacency matrix fails to capture key network flow context. Additionally, GNNs require extensive manual labeling, which is not scalable. LLMs (Large Language Models) have the potential to provide automatic labeling for the GNNs, but they lack the supplementary security context needed for effective labeling. To address these gaps, we present LLMGraph, which incorporates extended GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks) and domain-specific RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to achieve label-free detection against APTs in edge networks. LLMGraph’s extended GCNs model can capture network flow context and direction. LLMGraph’s domain-specific RAG pipeline can supplement key security contexts, including device vulnerability and network flow, for effective labeling. Additionally, LLMGraph provides an LLM aggregator to augment and merge the diverse topology of the edge networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art mechanisms, LLMGraph proves effective and scalable, improving the F1-score by at least 46.9%, and the training time for 1 million edge networks is within 1000 s.}

	abstract = {Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, End-to-End Neural Renderer Plus (E2E-NRP), which can accurately optimize and project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the E2E-NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA-final outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings.}

	abstract = {Wireless local area networks remain vulnerable to attacks initiated during the connection establishment (CE) phase. Even the latest Wi-Fi security protocols fail to fully mitigate threats such as man-in-the-middle, preamble spoofing, and relaying. To fortify the CE phase, this article presents a backward-compatible scheme, reinforced with timing constraints, that interweaves a medium access control (MAC) layer digital signature into the preamble signals at the physical (PHY) layer to counter these attacks. The approach slices the signature and embeds the encoded slices (for resiliency) within CE frame preambles without extending frame size, allowing one or multiple stations to concurrently verify their respective APs’ transmissions in enterprise and public Wi-Fi networks. The scheme supports concurrent CEs by enabling each station to analyze the consistent patterns in PHY-layer headers to determine whether the received frames are the anticipated ones, achieving 100% accuracy without inspecting MAC layer headers. Additionally, we design and implement a fast relay attack to rigorously challenge our defense's effectiveness. We extend existing open-source tools to support IEEE 802.11ax and evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of our scheme on a testbed consisting of software-defined radios (SDRs), commercial APs, and Wi-Fi devices. We demonstrate96-100% true positive rates in detecting relay attacks, andend-to-end formal analyses confirm the security and correctness of the proposed solution.}

	abstract = {Point of Sale (PoS) machines have become extremely popular recently. In many economies, most transactions occur using them. Although PoS technology is evolving, PINs are still heavily used. In this paper, we perform a large-scale study to understand how difficult it is to uncover user PINs at PoS, even when the users cover the pad with their hands. Our study involves 142 participants, two types of PoS, and around 13,800 PINs. We develop machine learning techniques to infer PoS PINs by using hidden cameras. Our results show that uncovering PINs in PoS is more complex than in other cases where a user PIN is used, e.g., ATMs, because of the small pad area of PoS. Nevertheless, we could achieve more than 50% Top-3 accuracy for 4-digit PINs and 45% Top-3 accuracy for 5-digit PINs, even when the PIN is covered by the user’s hand. We comment on the impact of the camera’s position and PoS on the successful inference of the user’s PINs. We also comment on the hardness of inferring PINs depending on the physical distance of digits and recommend what are good practices to generate PINs and cover PoS to make PIN inference difficult.}

	abstract = {This paper studies MPC based decision graph inference (MDGI) where decision graphs (generalization of decision trees) are very popular machine learning models. In MDGI, a modeler holding a private model and a data owner holding private feature vectors jointly run model inference on each vector through an MPC protocol, which outputs the inference result without revealing the model or vector. Several noteworthy MDGI solutions have been proposed, but they remain unsatisfactory for large models due to the high communication cost of oblivious decision, the most complex component in MDGI. Oblivious decision securely evaluates binary tests (Boolean-valued functions) over features without revealing test type, parameter, feature index, or value. All constant-round oblivious decision protocols suffer from high communication costs due to bitwise encryption and transmission. Moreover, most support only one of the three common test types: threshold comparison, equality test, and set containment. We propose Homomorphic Lookup Table (HLT), a novel MPC technique for oblivious decision. HLT circumvents the bitwise-encryption and heavy-communication issue by adopting table-lookup-style computation and amortizing the cost of encrypted table transfer across many inferences. We carefully design the table structure and lookup rules, and integrate homomorphic encryption to optimize performance and support multiple test types. HLT achieves  78\\times -4151\\times 78\\times -4151\\times  reduction in communication for oblivious decision, and is the first method to support all three common test types. Based on HLT, we design constant-round MDGI solutions for two widely used decision graphs: decision trees and scorecards. This is the first privacy-preserving solution for scorecards, and our decision tree solution reduces communication by  27\\times -321\\times 27\\times -321\\times .}

Specifically, natural language processing model, which allows to processing language data right close to the device location within milliseconds and providing intelligent controller, have revolutionized researches. Recently, privacy concerns spiked when it is applied in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, etc. Secure multi-party computation has the advantage of strong security guarantee and computability over multi-sourced data. However, it is challenging to translate the timeliness benefit of Edge AI to secure deployment, as only constrained computation and storage resources are available for the edge nodes. We focus on the natural language processing (NLP), and design an efficient secure three-party computation protocol (called QuickNLP) in the semi-honest setting tolerating one corruption. Specifically, for the non-linear operations, we adopt the constant-round distributed comparison function ( {\\sf DCF} {\\sf DCF} ) to evaluate the piecewise function efficiently with high accuracy. The proposed framework has been experimented with Python and the results show that QuickNLP could be a valuable solution for data privacy in edge computing.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure is a network of interconnected devices and systems, with applications ranging from remote healthcare to large-scale industrial applications. Securing such a resource-constrained infrastructure requires effective and efficient security measures, starting with a comprehensive security risk assessment. In traditional IT infrastructure, Bayesian Attack Graphs (BAGs) are commonly used for security risk assessment. The BAGs illustrate and quantify logical dependencies among vulnerabilities using real probabilities to depict potential attack paths, with their likelihood and impact. However, applying traditional BAGs to IoT infrastructure is challenging. First, purely additive nature of real probabilities makes it difficult to quantify exploits launched in tandem from the same or varying sources that may collectively exploit a given vulnerability or cancel out each other’s degenerative consequences on the network. Second, cycles may arise in BAGs, especially when attackers backtrack to a previously compromised state, a problem challenging to quantify using traditional BAGs. To address these challenges, this research proposes a risk assessment framework using complex probabilities for large-scale IoT applications. The framework effectively quantifies unpredictable attacker behavior, particularly when cycles occur due to attacker backtracking. A use case in the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness and validation.}

	abstract = {Recently, object detection has proven vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. The attackers holding a specially crafted patch can hide themselves from state-of-the-art detectors, e.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This attack can bring serious security threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. How to effectively detect this kind of adversarial examples to catch potential attacks has become an important problem. In this paper, we propose two detection methods: the signature-based method and the signature-independent method. First, we identify two signatures of existing adversarial patches that can be utilized to precisely locate patches within adversarial examples. By employing the signatures, a fast signature-based method is developed to detect the adversarial objects. Second, we present a robust signature-independent method based on the content semantics consistency of model outputs. Adversarial objects violate this consistency, appearing locally but disappearing globally, while benign ones remain consistently present. The experiments demonstrate that two proposed methods can effectively detect attacks both in the digital and physical world. These methods each offer distinct advantage. Specifically, the signature-based method is capable of real-time detection, while the signature-independent method can detect unknown adversarial patch attacks and makes defense-aware attacks almost impossible to perform.}

	abstract = {The steganography detection method based on deep learning fuse feature extraction and classification into one model, which reduces the human intervention in feature extraction and obtains a higher detection accuracy than the traditional steganography detection method based on manual feature extraction. However, many existing steganography detection methods based on deep learning generally need to increase the depth and width of the model to further improve the detection accuracy, but it also brings the increase of parameters and Flops (FLoating point OPerations) of the model, resulting in a large consumption of computing resources. Therefore, this manuscript proposes a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) steganography detection method based on ShuffleBottleneck and Attention mechanism (referred to as ShuffleBANet method, ShuffleBottleneck-Attention-Network Based Method). First, to enhance the network's recognition ability for steganography signals, high-pass filters are used to enhance the steganography feature signals and combined with the improved ShuffleBottleneck structure to enrich the residual features and improve the expression ability of features. Then, a large convolution kernel is used to increase the convolution field of view, and the channel attention mechanism SE (Squeeze and Excitation) and the spatial attention mechanism CA(CoordAttention) are used to capture the residual features between channels and the location information of steganography signals, respectively. Combined with the siamese network framework, the feature extraction backbone is constructed. Finally, the features of the backbone are fused to increase the diversity of features, cover features and stego features are classified using the Softmax function. In this manuscript, BossBase-1.01, BOWS2 and ALASKA#2 datasets are used as cover images, the classical and latest steganalysis methods are used to conduct extensive experiments on the stego images generated by both spatial domain and JPEG domain adaptive steganography algorithms. The experimental results show that compared with the latest SiaStegNet method and the classical SRNet method, the detection efficiency of the proposed method is significantly improved, and the number of parameters and Flops has been reduced by 7.04% / 76.23% and 70.92% / 84.49%, respectively, which provides a solution for the lightweight steganography detection model based on deep learning.}

	abstract = {Malware is proliferating at an exponential rate in cyberspace, posing serious threats to on-device systems characterized by limited computational capabilities. In this work, we address the critical challenge posed by data imbalance—where rare malware families receive inadequate representation—by proposing MalViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that directly operates in the JPEG frequency domain. Rather than converting Huffman-coded signals into RGB spatial images, MalViT leverages Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients to reduce data redundancy and computational overhead. We further improve the model’s generalization through both pre-training and fine-tuning workflows. Comprehensive evaluations on two large-scale, real-world malware datasets, MalNet-Image (1.26 M samples) and BODMAS (51 K samples), demonstrate that MalViT accelerates data loading by nearly threefold compared to existing methods. On GPU and CPU, MalViT achieves approximately 2.0× and 4.7× faster inference throughput than MobileViT, respectively, while incurring minimal or even improved accuracy loss. When processing 224 × 224-pixel JPEG images, MalViT completes inference within an average of 3.12ms per sample, which is 8.79× faster than VisMal and 5.91× faster than ViT4Mal. Furthermore, its compact design comprises only 1.1M parameters and requires 10M MACs, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained on-device deployment.}

	abstract = {Associative cache memory plays a decisive role in enhancing the performance and energy consumption of modern processors. Meanwhile, by occupying more than half of the processor chip area, cache memory is susceptible to transient and permanent faults, threatening the system's dependability. As the only hardware-managed memory module in the system, the tag array of the caches is the most critical and active component contributing a large fraction of energy consumption and error occurrence. Tag partitioning is a widespread approach for both tag energy consumption reduction and reliability enhancement. This approach splits the tag comparison operation into two steps, and only the tags whose k lower order bits are matched with that of the input address in the first step are activated for comparing their remaining higher order bits in the second step. The key decision parameter for tag partitioning is properly adjusting the tag-splitting point (k) to achieve the maximum reduction in the number of reads. This parameter has been intuitively, randomly, or experimentally selected in the existing studies without any justification. Even for an appropriate selection of this parameter via extensive experiments, its sensitivity to various cache configuration parameters makes it ad-hoc and not extendable to other scenarios. In this paper, we analytically illustrate that selecting an inappropriately large or small value for the tag-splitting point significantly downgrades the efficiency of tag partitioning and then formulate this parameter to determine its optimum value. As a function of cache configuration parameters, the proposed formulation is proven to be convex and differentiable for determining the optimum splitting point, besides its ability to accurately report the degree of the tag partitioning efficiency for any splitting point and configuration parameters. To approve the correctness and accuracy of the proposed formulation, we experimentally investigate the tag partitioning efficiency and optimum splitting point for a wide range of cache configurations and demonstrate a very close matching between the two. The proposed formulation is a guarantee for the designers and researchers to instantaneously determine the optimum tag-splitting point and calculate the read reduction of tag partitioning.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks; however, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks remains a significant concern. Existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing the construction phase of backdoor attacks, aiming to reduce the detectability of trigger patterns and enhance stealth. In contrast, the selection phase—specifically the identification of appropriate benign samples for poisoning—has received limited attention. Recent studies have explored efficient poisoning sample selection to improve attack stealth. However, the underlying factors that determine the informativeness or effectiveness of a sample for backdoor learning remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigate the role of forgettable event and loss landscape curvature in enhancing poisoning sample efficiency. Our findings reveal that samples most likely to be forgotten during the poisoning process are crucial for effective attacks, and that low-curvature regions of the loss surface correlate with higher poisoning efficiency. Based on these insights, we introduce the Improved Filtering and Updating Strategy (FUS++), which significantly outperforms traditional selection methods in terms of efficiency. Our contributions provide new perspectives on sample selection for backdoor attacks and propose a novel strategy to improve poisoning efficacy.}

This paper introduces COSMOS, a fault injection framework tailored for testing hardware-assisted hypervisors. By exploiting nested virtualization, COSMOS does not require instrumentation of the target and enables the assessment of multiple hypervisors. We performed an extensive fault injection campaign to assess popular hardware-assisted hypervisors like KVM, Xen, and Jailhouse. The results show a non-negligible percentage of non–fail-stop behaviors, with notable differences in hypervisors’ ability to log failures and prevent fault propagation with a timely recovery.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) aims to train neural network models using distributed data resources from multiple clients without sharing raw data. One of the key challenges in FL is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which may affect model accuracy. To address this issue, some schemes leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate virtual data and combine it with the real data to achieve a balanced data distribution. However, there are risks of privacy leakage from the collected virtual data and aggregated gradients. In this paper, we propose GetFed, an accurate and differentially private FL framework with GAN-based Data Generation on non-IID Data. We integrate Differential Privacy (DP) into the GAN training and federated aggregation phases to prevent clients’ privacy leakage. To balance privacy and accuracy, we first design a privacy-preserving virtual sample generation algorithm for GAN training that dynamically reduces unnecessary noise as the quality of virtual samples improves. Additionally, we design an adaptive DP-based secure aggregation algorithm that decreases the added noise as the model approaches convergence. Furthermore, we implement a real-virtual ensemble training algorithm, employing an ensemble learning strategy to better mix virtual and real samples for enhanced global model accuracy. This approach ensures clients benefit from both the authenticity of real samples and the balanced data distribution provided by virtual samples, effectively mitigating the data heterogeneity inherent in non-IID scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art schemes, GetFedimproves model accuracy by 6–47% and reduces training time by 50%.}

	abstract = {The decision tree (DT) model is widely usedin various applications due to its versatility, speed, and interpretability. However, outsourcing DT training and inference to cloud platforms raises data privacy concerns. While significant strides have been made in developing private DT training and inference using cryptography such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), the performance is still not ideal in real-world applications. Only a few recent works have explored using GPUs to enhance the performance of MPC-based deep learning. Nevertheless, data-dependent operations and the high communication costs inherent in MPC-based DT make the integration of GPUs a challenge. We introduce the eXpress GPU-based Tree (XGT), a fast MPC-based framework for private DT training and inference on GPUs. XGTconverts the majority of operations in training and inference into parallelizable matrix operations, supplemented by various optimizations, including matrix dimension reductions. This innovative design leads to substantial reductions in communication overhead while maintaining the critical property of obliviousness. XGTalso achieves a stronger security guarantee, where all data items, the tree shape, access patterns, and data distributions generated during the training and inference are protected. XGTonly reveals the tree depth. The experimental results show that XGTis up to  278{\\times } 278{\\times }  faster than the previous most efficient CPU-based approach. XGToutperforms the latest GPU-based DT work by  41{\\times } 41{\\times } . For inference, XGTis up to  2,800{\\times } 2,800{\\times }  faster than previous CPU-based inference schemes and at least  18 \\times 18 \\times  faster than GPU-based.}

	abstract = {Industrial control protocols (ICPs) play a significant role in ensuring dependable interconnection among devices in industrial environments. Protocol reverse engineering (PRE) techniques are commonly used to analyze a large number of agnostic and proprietary protocols based on network traffic traces or programs. However, conventional PRE methods face several challenges in reversing ICPs with complex data representations that contain rich structural features. In this work, we present a new perspective on message representation using the graph, and design a syntax inference framework for ICPs reverse analysis (InSyfer). Specifically, we propose a novel method to construct a single message graph for entire traces, automatically extracting syntactical similarity features. We also design an adaptive message clustering model that abstracts the clustering problem into a binary pairwise-classification framework to judge whether pairs of messages belong to the same groups and jointly optimizes it with feature extraction. The above design enables InSyfer to accurately identify message types and greatly improves the correctness of protocol format inference. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of InSyfer. Evaluations of four standard ICPs and two unknown protocols demonstrate that InSyfer outperforms the state-of-the-art PRE methods.}

	abstract = {By utilizing the sensing and perception capabilities of various devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) enables more precise awareness of the real world, thereby enhancing management and resource utilization efficiency. However, due to their open deployment environments and frequent message exchanges, IoT endpoints are highly vulnerable to a wide range of security threats and privacy breaches, including forgery, data theft, and information leakage. Therefore, to address these challenges and ensure device legitimacy verification and secure data exchange among IoT devices, we propose a privacy-preserving and traceable certificateless anonymous mutual authentication scheme (PPT-CLAMA). PPT-CLAMA not only eliminates the need for a secure channel during key generation but also prevents attackers from tracing the real identity of devices through their own identity or public keys while providing pseudonym and anonymous authentication to devices, demonstrating greater practicality. Furthermore, through security proofs and analysis, PPT-CLAMA satisfies various high-level security properties, including mutual authentication, key agreement, nonrepudiation, unlinkability, perfect forward secrecy, known session-specific temporary information security, traceability, anonymity, and privacy preservation. The simulation results indicate that, compared to authentication and key agreement schemes, PPT-CLAMA reduces the average computational overhead and average communication overhead during the authentication process by 6.73% and 3.31%, respectively, demonstrating higher computational and communication efficiency.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of cloud storage has raised considerable data privacy concerns for outsourced databases. In recent years, Structured Encryption (STE) has emerged as a promising solution to build encrypted databases that efficiently handle queries while preserving privacy through underlying structures called Encrypted Multi-Maps (EMMs). However, current STE-based schemes primarily focus on static settings, and their direct extensions to dynamic settings introduce significant challenges in client storage overhead and update efficiency with join condition. In this paper, we present an efficient dynamic encrypted database scheme supporting large-scale data. To address the challenges in dynamic settings, we first propose a novel dynamic EMM design with constant client storage that utilizes a global counter to reduce client storage overhead. We then introduce an algorithm for dynamically handling join queries based on tags generated from values of the join attribute, significantly reducing update overhead. We implement our scheme and conduct comparative analyses with existing dynamic STE schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme offers significant advantages in terms of client storage overhead and update performance.}

	abstract = {Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative multi-agent model training with distributed feature spaces. Compared to horizontal federated learning (HFL), poisoning attacks in VFL confront the challenges of partial/incomplete data and model information, i.e., the adversary only has its local input feature space and model structure without knowing the ground-truth labels or server-side model. Existing attacks are inefficient in terms of stability and scalability under different learning configurations. In this paper, we design the poisoning framework via embedding manipulation in the model-partitioning structure of VFL, and propose two efficient poisoning attacks, i.e., layer embedding manipulation (LMP) and perturbation embedding manipulation (PMP). Both LMP and PMP meticulously transform the benign embeddings into the poisoned ones to dominate the model prediction. In particular, LMP blends a malicious trigger layer to poison the embedding. PMP exploits the gradients to generate a universal perturbation, which can be injected into the benign embeddings for poisoning. We conduct extensive experiments for attack performance evaluation. PMP and LMP achieve an average attack success rate of more than 0.9, and keep stability and robustness under different learning configurations. We further conduct six different defense methods to evaluate the proposed attacks. The proposed attacks are still shown to succeed against these defenses, necessitating the advanced defenses for VFL in future work.}

Nevertheless, they are vulnerable to privacy invasions from unauthorized photography. Addressing this, we propose a novel Moiré encryption technique-based secure screen-camera communication system, named MoiréComm. The Moiré encryption can enhance security by using distinct spatial frequency patterns for camouflage. The original QR code is revealed as a Moiré pattern only when the camera in a designated position, e.g., directly in front and 30 cm from the screen. From any other positions, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. Decryption schemes are customized for different scenarios. The multi-frame approach achieves a decryption success of over 98.6% within 13.2 frames in handheld scenarios. Conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based decryption method decodes the Moiré QR code images with a 98.8% success rate in 0.02 s within three frames and is also applicable in handheld scenarios. For fixed screen-camera setups, our fast decryption scheme achieves 99.4% success within two frames, with average 0.4 s latency. Significantly, the decryption rate plunges to 0% for surveillance cameras displaced by 20 ^\\circ ^\\circ  or more than  \\ge \\ge 10 cm from the target position, demonstrating MoiréComm's resilience against attacks.}

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has exposed us to a growing threat landscape. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, offer innovative solutions for trustworthy IoT attack detection. Despite the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, most existing AI-based IoT attack detection methods rely on complex deep learning models for automated feature extraction and generalization. However, DL models are inherently overconfident and tend to produce unreliable predictions both in-distribution and under distribution shifts when deployed. The large model size, coupled with deterministic and overconfident predictions, and limited focus on estimating the uncertainty, hinders the trustworthy deployment of DL models in applications where reliability is critical, not just high accuracy. In this paper, we present a framework for confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation of DL models in the context of IoT attack detection. Specifically, we propose a novel framework for the trustworthy design of deep IoT attack detection models, along with a lightweight DL model that achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) attack detection performance. We demonstrate how both our DL model and other SoTA DL models can be effectively integrated into the proposed framework to ensure trustworthy IoT attack detection. Evaluated on the large-scale benchmark IoT-23 network traffic dataset in terms of calibration, uncertainty, and distribution shift, our approach delivers superior and trustworthy IoT attack detection performance.}

	abstract = {As decentralized storage becomes more prevalent, ensuring data integrity within these systems has gained increasing importance. However, the introduction of a centralized and trusted Cloud Combiner (CO) to manage auditing across distributed Cloud Servers (CSs) presents several challenges, which not only increases communication costs with independent CSs but also diminishes the credibility of the auditing results. Additionally, traditional approaches often require either certificate and key management or the establishment of secure transmission channels, which incur substantial overhead. Furthermore, the computational cost for index generation to support searchable auditing is often high. To address these challenges, we propose a collaborative and searchable integrity auditing scheme for multi-replica data that eliminates the need for a CO. Specifically, we design a certificate-based authenticator for multi-copy data blocks, which simplifies certificate and key management while removing the need for secure channels. To enable efficient searchable auditing, we introduce a novel index tag that matches authenticators, thereby reducing the computational overhead. Moreover, we leverage blockchain technology to enhance the credibility of the auditing process and ensure the integrity of the search results. Both security and performance analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.}

However, the collection of large volumes of medical data poses a significant risk of privacy leakage. Most existing privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes focus on additive aggregation of single or multi-dimensional data, which greatly limits their applicability. This article introduces a blockchain-based multifunctional data aggregation (BM-PDA) scheme for e-health systems. First, BM-PDA supports overall aggregation queries of data samples and can compute the maximum and minimum values within these samples. Second, it enables selective data aggregation queries based on various user attributes. Furthermore, analysis shows that integrating these two algorithms protects both user’s private data and attribute data. Performance evaluations indicate that the computational and communication costs are acceptable, demonstrating the scheme’s practical applicability.}

	abstract = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables each party with a private set to compute the intersection without disclosing other information. However, even in maliciously secure PSI, it does not guarantee input authenticity and output integrity, which becomes problematic in certain scenarios. For instance, in Web 3.0, one of the essential requirements is to find common certifiers among the parties. However, if certifier identities are meant to be protected, some parties may attempt to forge certifier identities or intentionally exclude a particular certifier during protocol execution. Recently, the Private Certifier Intersection (PCI), a variant of PSI, has been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless, it incurs significantly high computational and communication overhead. This work proposes the Private Identity Intersection (PII), which takes private identifiers and corresponding anonymous signatures from mutually distrusting parties as input, verifies them, and delivers the intersection of the successfully verified identifiers to all parties while ensuring the integrity of the output. Furthermore, PII can naturally extend from two to multiple-party settings while resisting the collusion attack. To achieve the ideal functionality of PII, we implement a user-friendly MPC framework called  \\mathsf {Oryx} \\mathsf {Oryx}  without third-party libraries. Based on  \\mathsf {Oryx} \\mathsf {Oryx} , we instantiate PII with two digital signature schemes, one proposed in this paper. Compared to existing work, our PII protocols reduce the computation overhead by up to  163\\times 163\\times  and the communication overhead by up to  190\\times 190\\times , representing an improvement of two orders of magnitude. To demonstrate the practicality of our work, we evaluate its performance in WAN environments with bandwidths of 100 Mbps and 500 Mbps, under a fixed latency of 20 ms.}

	abstract = {The deployment of learning-based models to detect malicious activities in network traffic flows is significantly challenged by concept drift. With evolving attack technology and dynamic attack behaviors, the underlying data distribution of recently arrived traffic flows deviates from historical empirical distributions over time. Existing approaches depend on a significant amount of labeled drifting samples to facilitate the deep model to handle concept drift, which faces labor-intensive manual labeling and the risk of label noise. In this paper, we propose ReCDA, a Concept Drift Adaptation method with Representation enhancement, which consists of a self-supervised representation enhancement stage and a weakly-supervised classifier tuning stage. Specifically, in the initial stage, ReCDA introduces drift-aware perturbation and representation alignment to facilitate the model in acquiring robust representations from drift-aware and drift-invariant perspectives. In the subsequent stage, a meticulously crafted instructive sampling strategy and a robust representation constraint encourage the model to learn discriminative knowledge about benign and malicious activities during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing performance further. We conduct comprehensive offline and online evaluations on several benchmark datasets under varying degrees of concept drift. The experiment results demonstrate the superior adaptability and robustness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Widespread reuse of open-source code in smart contract development boosts programming efficiency but significantly amplifies bug propagation across contracts, while dedicated methods for detecting similar smart contract functions remain very limited. Conventional abstract-syntax-tree (AST) based methods for smart contract similarity detection face challenges in handling intricate tree structures, which impedes detailed semantic comparison of code. Recent deep-learning based approaches tend to overlook code syntax and detection interpretability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To fill this research gap, we introduce SmartDetector, a novel approach for computing similarity between smart contract functions, explainable at the fine-grained statement level. Technically, SmartDetector decomposes the AST of a smart contract function into a series of smaller statement trees, each reflecting a structural element of the source code. Then, SmartDetector uses a classifier to compute the similarity score of two functions by comparing each pair of their statement trees. To address the infinite hyperparameter space of the classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to efficiently search optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experiments conducted on three large real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartDetector outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by an average improvement of 14.01% in F1-score, achieving an overall average F1-score of 95.88%.}

	abstract = {With the wide implementation of mobile edge computing (MEC) in latency-sensitive applications, edge distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a critical threat to system availability. Existing edge DDoS mitigation approaches predominantly rely on quasi-static configurations, making them inadequate in handling the dynamic evolution of user requests, resource availability, and attack behaviors over time. Ignoring system dynamics can lead to strategy inefficiency, resource wastage, and service degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the dynamic edge DDoS mitigation (DEDM) problem and design an online DEDM framework, OLEDM. It models DEDM as a multi-slot dynamic decision-making process, builds a potential game for request competition in each time slot, and achieves stable request evacuation through multi-player best response updates. Across time slots, it introduces an auction-based strategy adoption mechanism to dynamically decide whether to adopt new strategies, thereby adapting to continuous changes in request patterns and resource conditions. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that OLEDM outperforms existing methods by effectively adapting to dynamic variations in request load, attack intensity, and edge resource availability.}

Subsequently, we craft an automatic attack tool, Auto SARAs, to demonstrate the real-life impact of this attack. The experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark show that SARAs can successfully compromise 1,449,125 records in HEDB within only 167.06 seconds. As for defenses, we prove that authentication mechanisms, whether pre-query authentication or post-query authentication, are insufficient to defend against SARAs, which represent an inherent vulnerability within HEDB systems.}

	abstract = {Hybrid and patching-based fuzzing methods offer promise in uncovering software bugs using concolic execution and program transformation techniques. However, current implementations face efficiency challenges from three main factors. First, the efficacy of hybrid fuzzing can be compromised due to disruptions introduced during the mutation of inputs generated by concolic execution, hindering vulnerability discovery. Second, the speed and throughput of the underlying fuzzer significantly impact the effectiveness of both methods. Third, patching-based fuzzing has an inefficient patching system and high analysis costs. Nonetheless, hybrid and patching-based fuzzing offer complementary strengths that can enhance overall efficacy. For instance, patching can maintain exploration depth by reducing the likelihood of input structure disruption, while concolic execution can authenticate detected crashes. In this article, we present PatchFuzz, which integrates fuzzing and patching at a fundamental level, leveraging concolic execution to augment the fuzzing process. Specifically, PatchFuzz binds patching addresses with each seed rather than the program itself, promoting frequent interactions between patching and fuzzing. Additionally, we’ve devised efficient methodologies for patching information management and patched program switching. Evaluation on LAVA-M, CGC and OSS-Fuzz datasets shows PatchFuzz surpasses state-of-the-art fuzzers like QSYM, SYMQEMU, AFL++ CmpLog and T-Fuzz. Deployed on industrial devices, PatchFuzz uncovered 9 new vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Malware detection remains a critical challenge due to the increasing use of code obfuscation, packing, and wrapping techniques, which hinder traditional static analysis methods. Dynamic analysis, particularly through the examination of Application Programming Interface (API) call sequences, has emerged as an effective approach for identifying malicious behaviors. However, existing deep learning models often struggle to generate high-quality representations of API calls and are unable to handle previously unseen APIs, thereby limiting detection performance and model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel malware dynamic analysis framework that leverages GPT-4 prompt engineering to generate descriptive text for each API call within a sequence. These descriptions are then encoded using a pre-trained BERT model to produce rich, knowledge-enhanced representations of API sequences. Our method not only incorporates external knowledge for improved semantic understanding but also enables the representation of unknown API calls, thus enhancing generalization. We further design a CNN-based classifier to extract features from the enriched representations for malware detection and classification. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Especially, the detection accuracy on the Catak dataset increased by 12.38%, which highlights the significant improvement of our method in challenging scenarios.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose significant security risks to the community. Researchers thereby propose techniques to capture the complex and stealthy scenarios of APT attacks through the use of provenance graphs to model system entities and their dependencies. Particularly, to mitigate the dependency explosion problem in attack investigation using provenance graphs, tag-based and priority-based provenance graphs are frequently utilized for analyzing attacks. These methods use threat tag propagation and threat prioritization to reduce the size of the provenance graph for faster analysis. Unfortunately, these methods can allow more complex and potential attacks to evade detection. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an APT attack investigation system, ProTaging, for APT detection and forensic analysis. By using Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) rules to assign and update the node’s threat tag, splittable tag propagation to control the scope of threat information, and threat weight aggregation and prioritized backward analysis during the forensic analysis phase, ProTaging effectively reconstructs attack paths in seconds without dependency explosion. Experimental results on both the simulation dataset, DARPA TC E3, E5 dataset, and DARPA OpTC dataset demonstrate that ProTaging generates smaller dependency graphs (2.5 times smaller) and has fewer false positives (6.7 times fewer) compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Additionally, ProTaging significantly reduces manual investigation effort by approximately 99.9%.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks to deep neural networks (DNNs). These attacks involve models that make intentionally incorrect (and potentially targetsed) predictions on poisoned inputs containing carefully crafted triggers, while operating normally with clean inputs. Prior studies have investigated the invisibility of backdoor triggers to improve attack stealthiness. However, they primarily concentrate on achieving invisibility solely in the spatial domain, ignoring the generation of invisible triggers in the frequency and feature domains. This constraint makes the poisoned images vulnerable to detection by recent defense mechanisms. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Triple stealthy BAckdoor attack approach, termed TriBA, which simultaneously ensures the invisibility of triggers in all the spatial, frequency, and feature domains, to achieve desirable attack performance, while ensuring strong stealthiness. Specifically, we initially utilize Wavelet Transform to embed the high-frequency information from the trigger image into the clean image to ensure effective attack performance. Then, to achieve strong stealthiness across both spatial and frequency domains, we integrate Fourier Transform and Cosine Transform to blend the poisoned image and clean image in the frequency domain. Furthermore, TriBA adopts an attack strategy to make the backdoor features similar to clean features in the feature space, which guarantees trigger invisibility in the feature domain while maintaining attack effectiveness. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of this strategy. Finally, TriBA has been comprehensively evaluated on four datasets against popular image classifiers, demonstrating a marked improvement over existing state-of-the-art backdoor attacks in terms of both attack success rate and stealthiness.}

	abstract = {To address limitations in existing privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning (CDL) schemes, we propose a dual-server privacy-preserving CDL scheme based on homomorphic encryption and a masking technique. Specifically, in our scheme a random seed is used to initialize a pseudorandom generator that produces multiple pseudorandom numbers. These pseudorandom numbers, along with a random noise, are utilized to generate masks that are added to all parameters of a participant's locally trained model. By using homomorphic encryption, the random noise can be encrypted and eventually used to remove the masks with low message expansion. This also ensures that the global model is lossless in accuracy. Furthermore, if participants join or leave the system, only the time required to complete both model update aggregation and encrypted masks aggregation is affected. We demonstrate that our scheme is round-efficient, dynamic and lossless. We also show that it is secure against inference attacks and can resist collusion attacks of up to  t-2 t-2  participants and one of the two servers, where  t t  is a security parameter indicating the minimum number of participants that participate in an aggregation round.}

While encrypting cloud data helps individuals ensure the security and privacy of cloud data, all-or-nothing encryption hinders effective access control and data search. To address this issue, this paper proposes fine-grained attribute-based encryption supporting multi-keyword-based data search to circumvent critical issues, including the assumption of online third-party authority, expensive user revocation, and a lack of expressiveness on keyword search problems. The proposed protocol empowers users to authorize cloud servers to perform keyword searches on encrypted data without forfeiting data privacy. Besides, the length of the ciphertext and the user key is short and fixed, having no noteworthy impact on the user growth in the system. The proposed protocol is formally secure against the indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext (IND-CPA) attack under the standard model with the generalized decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. The comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed scheme demonstrates that it outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. Thus, our system is suitable for real-world applications due to its enhanced security characteristics, adaptability, and efficacy.}

	abstract = {Obtaining dedicated fraud detection models is important for financial risk management. Online transaction platforms traditionally rely on local data to accumulate domain knowledge and establish fraud detection models to detect fraud. This naturally makes those online trading platforms with limited data and hardware resources more susceptible to fraudulent transactions. In this article, we propose GMDK, which elegantly integrates credible knowledge generation and collaborative model training on weak transaction platforms. Specifically, we decouple the local model parameters into base and specialized layers to learn different levels of knowledge. Local platforms milk different source models with delicately designed two-factor cues to acquire both cross-domain and credible domain-specific knowledge. To this end, source models first aggregate local base layer parameters of each local model to obtain cross-domain base layers for all local models. Then, distinct semantic distribution prototypes generated by heterogeneous source models on desensitized and sampled local business data are aligned to update local models. We conduct extensive experiments on various real-world online transaction platforms, and the results demonstrate that local models trained with GMDK can achieve state-of-the-art fraud detection accuracy in each target transaction area.}

	abstract = {While machine learning as a service (MLaaS) enables users to leverage powerful pre-trained models at low cost, it also poses significant intellectual property risks for model builders. A widely adopted defense mechanism is to embed ownership credentials (e.g., watermarking information) into the model, allowing the verifier to examine them during ownership verification. Despite the effectiveness of such watermark-based schemes, we identify a critical vulnerability, termed the model defamation attack (MDA). If an adversary compromises a verifier and obtains the submitted credential, it can reuse this stolen information by embedding it into a malicious model\xa0 \\hat{E} \\hat{E}  and falsely attribute its ownership to the original model builder, thereby damaging their reputation. This article presents a generic anti-MDA model certification (GAMC) framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing watermarking schemes to enhance their robustness. We identify two design goals: (1) credential confidentiality, which prevents sensitive watermark-related information from being leaked during verification; and (2) credential non-reusability, which prevents the reuse of any previously submitted credentials. To this end, we employ a cryptographic accumulator to construct the model certification mechanism and design a customized  \\Sigma _{{{OR}}} \\Sigma _{{{OR}}}  protocol as a complement. We formally prove the security of our anti-MDA framework and conduct extensive experiments across various watermarking schemes and neural network architectures to evaluate its compatibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that GAMC improves robustness against model defamation attacks by 86.67% with negligible overhead, demonstrating its practicality for real-world deployment.}

	abstract = {In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Furthermore, traditional black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory-augmented black-box strategy to effectively mislead target models. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios with the DN-121 target model and 1000 attack iterations, highlighting its robustness in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach for practical use.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely deployed across applications, but growing model sizes and performance demands on edge devices necessitate aggressive compiler-based acceleration, as enabled by frameworks like TVM. Compiling models into standalone executables, however, introduces new security risks, reverse-engineering these binaries can reveal core architectures and enable unauthorized model cloning or tampering. Existing defenses largely rely on trusted execution or encryption, which target weight confidentiality but fail to protect architectural details or operator attributes, often with high runtime costs. To address these gaps, we propose MACO, a multi-tier obfuscation framework built atop TVM, spanning high-level graph rewriting and low-level IR transformations. MACO integrates three transformation categories: operator attribute obfuscation, memory layout perturbation, and dummy branching, covering the full compilation stack. A tiered design enables flexible trade-offs between security and performance. We evaluate MACO on eight common models and three attack types: side-channel, symbolic execution, and deep learning–based extraction. Results show up to 85.8% reduction in attribute inference success and 99% reduction in topology reconstruction, with the lightest tier incurring only 1.036× overhead over the unobfuscated baseline.}

While ensemble-based guided attacks improve adversarial transferability by increasing the diversity of image-text pairs, they primarily rely on spatial-domain data augmentation, which can lead to model overfitting to image details and limit the generalization capability of attacks. To address this limitation, this study proposes a frequency-domain adjustment-based adversarial attack method that modifies specific frequency components of input images to reduce detail interference and enhance the stability of adversarial examples. Additionally, a fine-grained feature extraction technique is introduced to optimize image-text alignment, further improving the transferability of cross-modal attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior attack transferability and generalization performance across two major VLP architectures, fusion models and alignment models, as well as multiple tasks on the Flickr30 K and MSCOCO datasets.}

	abstract = {Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is a critical approach to ensuring the security, stability, and reliability of software. When exploited by malicious actors or hackers, code vulnerabilities can lead to a series of severe consequences and cause significant losses. However, the effectiveness of real-world CVD is currently unsatisfactory, with several issues that need to be optimized and resolved. These issues include the poor quality of real-world CVD datasets, the high resource consumption of code intermediate structures, the imbalance between positive and negative samples, and insufficient feature modeling of code vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive and efficient framework for real-world CVD called MARCOVul. It offers a complete process from data preprocessing to final vulnerability detection, optimizing the entire real-world CVD pipeline. Our approach begins with a data derivation technique which seeks to improve the overall quality of the dataset. Next, we propose a code-specific data augmentation method to tackle the issue of sample imbalance in the dataset. We then propose a code intermediate structure simplification method to reduce computational complexity and resource consumption while fully leveraging the power of language models. Finally, we propose a real-world CVD method based on multi-feature fusion to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. Experiments on a large-scale real-world CVD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCOVul in detecting real-world code vulnerabilities, achieving up to 12.75% Binary-F1 score (BF1) and 6.98% matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) improvements over the best unweighted baselines, and 1.55% BF1 and 1.42% MCC gains over the best weighted ones.}

	abstract = {Two-Dimensional (2D) barcodes attract much attention recently due to their higher capacity for storing information as compared with 1D barcodes. This article considers the problem of defending against Illegitimately-Copying (IC) attacks in 2D barcodes. This problem is important because the authorized manufacturer may lose its economy and reputation under IC attacks. In addition, the application of using 2D barcodes for anti-counterfeiting is also sacrificed by the IC attacks. However, prior anti-copying 2D barcodes have high production costs, and their universal applicability is low. Moreover, they are vulnerable to advanced IC attacks. In this article, we propose a tag-based anti-copying 2D barcode, which is denoted as the Superimposed-Tag Anti-Copying (STAC) 2D barcode. Specifically, the difference between the channel noise from the legitimate and illegitimate 2D barcodes is adopted to detect IC attacks. Our scheme overcomes the drawbacks of the prior anti-copying 2D barcodes since our scheme provides not only better security but also better compatibility as compared to the prior anti-copying 2D barcodes. We first provide the theoretical model of an illegitimate channel. Based on the theoretical model, we explicitly analyze the Probability of Attacking Detection (PAD) and the Probability of False Alarm (PFA) of our scheme. Moreover, we derive their closed-form expressions as well as the optimal authentication threshold. To further improve the performance of our scheme, we optimize the amplitude allocation factor of the authentication tag and the embedding area. We implement the proposed schemes and conduct extensive performance comparisons via experimental results. The experimental results using a scanner demonstrate that, based on the best-attacking performance chosen from the existing IC attacks, the PAD of the Two-Level QR (2LQR) code is 0.3462 and that of the Low-Cost Anti-Copying (LCAC) 2D barcode is 0, whereas that of our scheme is 0.5712, where we set the PFA as 0.02.}

	abstract = {While multi-key homomorphic encryption (MKHE) ensures privacy in federated learning (FL) by encrypting model updates, its requirement for aggregate ciphertext decryption and dropout handling increases communication rounds during aggregation. To enable secure multi-key aggregation with low communication rounds, we propose SAMK. SAMK enables the server to compute the sum of model updates from clients participating in FL, while keeping these updates encrypted by different keys throughout the computation. By utilizing the polynomial property of the BFV ciphertext, SAMK successfully implements individual decryption of the aggregated ciphertext (encrypted under multiple keys) by each client using their respective keys, resulting in low communication rounds. It means that in SAMK, all client interactions are avoided and the client-server interaction is only once (ciphertext uploads and downloads) in each round of aggregation computation. In addition, SAMK is robust to any number of clients dropping out at any time, and the client who has dropped out after uploading model updates, can still get the correct aggregation result upon reconnecting. We prove the security of SAMK for semi-honest server and clients, where client collusion is also considered. At last, we implement SAMK and comprehensively evaluate its performance to demonstrate its practicability.}

	abstract = {External disks (henceforth referred to as disks) are commonly used data storage peripherals for hosts. Verifying the legitimacy of these disks is essential to mitigate security risks, such as privacy breaches and virus propagation, before initiating interactions with a host. To address this challenge, we propose DiskPrint, a novel replay-resistant, few-shot disk authentication system that relies on unintentional electromagnetic (EM) emanations from the internal components of disks. The core idea of DiskPrint is that EM signals emitted during data writing operations can reveal unique hardware discrepancies among different disks. Building on electromagnetic theory, we develop a theoretical model that links EM signals to the underlying electronic components of the disk, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting distinctive disk fingerprints from these emanations. We also propose a set of signal enhancement techniques aimed at mitigating EM interface noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EM measurements. To further strengthen the security of DiskPrint, we introduce a device-agnostic, replay-resistant approach by incorporating randomness into the leaked EM signals. Additionally, we improve the basic version of DiskPrint (Song et al. 2024) by integrating the anti-replay signal and authentication-oriented signal into a unified time series and enabling authentication with only a few registration samples. Real-world experiments with 60 disks, spanning both hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) from seven brands and 14 different models, indicate that DiskPrint achieves an authentication success rate exceeding 99.6% with only three registration samples. A robustness analysis confirms its stability over time, while a security evaluation shows its resilience against various attack scenarios.}

	abstract = {As a well-known graph embedding method, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely applied to recommendation systems and social media analysis, in which privacy concerns regarding sensitive data have emerged in the public view due to the collection of personal preferences. Although the regularization methods are introduced to improve the network's security, the GCN tends to memorize individual user information in latent representations susceptible to the Membership Inference Attack (MIA). In addition, the previous works focus on improving the security while hurting the utility, or vice versa, which induces “negative transfer”. In this paper, we propose a novel disentangled-based framework to defend MIA and alleviate the issue of negative transfer in multi-task learning. First, we divide the sensitive and practical channels from the latent representations of graph nodes to minimize their linear dependency. Then, to effectively train our model, we employ the sub-computational graphs to generate local gradients for different tasks and allocate losses to them. Finally, we propose a novel mixed updating strategy to accumulate the updating information of sub-computational graphs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can mitigate the risk of membership inference while ensuring model accuracy.}

To mitigate this problem, many cloud-based data-sharing systems employ cryptographic tools to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive data. Nevertheless, fine-grained data sharing still suffers from many challenges, especially in complex cloud environments. In this paper, we introduce two cloud-based data-sharing systems with fine-grained access control. The first solution supports dynamic user groups, while the second solution further offers outsourced decryption, enabling compatibility with resource-constrained devices. To formalize our solution theoretically, we introduce the concept of ElGamal-type cryptosystem (ETC) and server-aided ETC with key encapsulation mechanism to generalize public-key encryption with specific features implicitly specified by ElGamal encryption. Through the application of ETC, we present generic constructions for revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) and server-aided RABE (SR-ABE) with formal definitions and security analyses. These schemes serve as the fundamental mechanisms behind our proposed solutions. By applying the state-of-the-art attribute-based encryption scheme proposed in CCS’22, we introduce instantiations of RABE and SR-ABE with various desirable properties, including large universe, attribute multi-use, key exposure resistance, fast decryption, and more. Extensive experiments substantiate the superior performance of our proposed instantiations over previous solutions.}

In 5G-MEC systems, service providers are at the forefront of delivering cutting-edge, low-latency services that redefine connectivity experiences. Service providers face significant challenges in monetizing their offerings while ensuring the security and dependability of their network slices. The slice broker plays a crucial role in the supply chain, enabling efficient resource allocation and dynamic service provisioning to meet diverse user demands. There is a trade-off between revenue generation and resource allocation efficiency, which should be investigated to identify optimal revenue strategies for the slice broker. Security and dependability are paramount in 5G-MEC systems due to the extensive sharing of resources and critical data processing at the edge. From a security perspective, malicious attackers can be active to inject attacks, e.g., backdoor attacks, data poisoning etc. From a dependability point of view, there can be faults that may mislead the system, e.g., Byzantine faults. We propose an adaptive method by which agents can detect malicious attackers and faults during revenue model learning, where both security and dependability are considered.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning technology, deep learning-based Image-to-Image (I2I) networks have become the predominant choice for I2I tasks like image super-resolution and denoising. Despite their remarkable performance, the security of I2I networks has not been thoroughly investigated. While some studies have probed their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, none have explored the backdoor attack against I2I networks, which is a more stealthy and severe threat. In this work, for the first time, we comprehensively investigate the vulnerability of I2I networks to backdoor attacks. We propose a backdoor attack against I2I tasks, where the backdoored I2I network behaves normally on clean input images, yet outputs a specific inappropriate image when the backdoor trigger appears on the input image. To achieve such an I2I backdoor attack, we design a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) generation algorithm for I2I networks, where the generated UAP is used as the trigger for the I2I backdoor. Besides, multi-task learning (MTL) with dynamic weighting methods is employed in the backdoor training process to gain better results. Expanding our focus beyond I2I tasks, we extend our I2I backdoor to attack downstream tasks, including image classification and object detection. Specifically, the backdoor-triggered image processed by the backdoored image denoising network can fool the downstream image classifiers and object detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the I2I backdoor on state-of-the-art I2I network architectures as well as the robustness against different backdoor defenses.}

	abstract = {Traditional video encryption methods protect video content by encrypting each frame individually. However, in resource-constrained environments, this approach consumes significant computational resources. To overcome this challenge, this article proposes a novel method called “Encrypt a story (EAS)”, which aims to enhance encryption efficiency by focusing on encrypting specific segments of the video rather than encrypting each frame. The EAS refers to selecting segments in the time dimension of the video that contain important information or key events for encryption. This method leverages video segmentation techniques to focus encryption efforts on continuous key frames, significantly reducing the consumption of computational resources. To address the need for a large number of key streams during the encryption process, this article proposes a discrete sinusoidal memristive Rulkov neuron map (DSM-RNM). Through attractor analysis, complexity comparison, Lyapunov exponent, and NIST tests, we validated its ability to generate highperformance pseudorandom sequences, which significantly enhances the security of the encryption algorithm. Notably, the DSMRNM is shown to exhibit a phenomenon of infinitely coexisting attractors. Furthermore, by constructing a digital circuit to capture the attractors of the DSM-RNM, its potential for industrial applications is demonstrated. Evaluation results show that the EAS saves approximately 90% of the time while ensuring security, exhibiting strong practicality and efficiency.}

	abstract = {In this article, a secret image sharing (SIS) scheme for general access structures (GAS) is designed for distributed multi-user scenario. In the proposed distributed multi-user SIS (DM-SIS), multiple secret images are encoded into shadows which are then distributed to the corresponding storage nodes of a network. By collecting the shadows from nodes, each user is capable of decrypting the corresponding secret image. Fundamentally, we utilize an invertible target matrix, which is initially obtained from the GAS and a base matrix with Vandermonte coordinates, to construct shadows. To deal with the case of non-invertible target matrix, three matrix-adjusting procedures are further introduced. Theoretical analysis, numerical examples, and experiments are provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed technique. When compared to previous methods, the proposed approach can implement GAS sharing strategy in distributed multi-user environment. Meantime, significant improvements on storage overhead and sharing capacity are also achieved.}

	abstract = {For security enhancement and privacy preservation, homomorphic encryption is deployed to facilitate computations among cipher texts. To transmit extra data over a cipher text without affecting its usage, lossless data hiding in encrypted domain (LDH-CT) has been developed by exploiting randomness introduced in homomorphic encryption such as Paillier, BGN and NTRU schemes. As data extraction without decrypting the cipher text has been accomplished with BGN, how to retrieve the hidden data after decryption remains unexplored. In this article, an LDH-CT scheme named random number replacement and partitioning (RNRP) is proposed to achieve the versatility of data embedding by designing two algorithms, namely the random number replacement algorithm to embed data to be extracted after decryption and the cipher value selection algorithm to embed data to be extracted without decryption. For the first time, confidential information to be extracted after decryption can be hidden into a cipher text by a third party without knowing its plain text. For convenience in performance evaluation, the proposed algorithms and the RNRP scheme are applied to a set of test images. Experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-art schemes demonstrate the better applicability of the proposed scheme, such as in saving bandwidth.}

	abstract = {In recent years, multi-dimensional range query (MRQ) over encrypted data has been increasingly applied in various scenarios, making it one of the mainstream services for secure large-scale data storage and sharing in cloud computing. However, although existing privacy-preserving MRQ schemes can ensure query and data privacy, they still fail to fully protect single-dimensional privacy and path pattern. Moreover, most schemes lack mechanisms to verify the completeness and correctness of query results, making it impossible to guarantee their validity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure and efficient MRQ scheme with result verification for multiple users (MU-MRQ). First, we design a secure and efficient multi-dimensional data index based on the G-tree, incorporating a timestamp mechanism to verify the correctness and completeness of query results. Additionally, we propose two novel intersection predicate encryption protocols to achieve efficient retrieval while preserving single-dimensional privacy and path pattern. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that our MU-MRQ scheme achieves security under the known background model. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficiency of the MU-MRQ scheme.}
