	abstract = {To improve the success probability of a mission execution, scheduled checkpointing is often implemented to save completed portions of the mission task so that a system can resume the mission execution effectively after its restoration whenever the system failure occurs. This paper considers a repairable computing system subject to the scheduled checkpointing. The checkpointing intervals are deterministic, but can be even or uneven. The system repair time is fixed while the system time-to-failure can follow any arbitrary type of distributions. The maximum number of repairs is specified by a certain threshold value. A multi-valued decision diagram (MDD)-based analytical approach is proposed to evaluate the exact success probability of a mission execution for the considered repairable system. The proposed approach enables generating a compact mission MDD model where identical subMDD models can be merged to improve computational efficiency and reduce storage requirement. The MDD model, once being constructed, can be reused for system reliability evaluations using different input parameter values. A benchmark study is presented to show the efficiency of proposed MDD approach. A case study is performed to illustrate the application of the proposed MDD approach to facilitate decision making about proper system design and parameter selection.}

	abstract = {Most of the existing mobile application (app) vetting mechanisms only estimate risks at a coarse-grained level by analyzing app syntax but not semantics. We propose a semantics-aware privacy risk assessment framework (SPRisk), which considers the sensitivity discrepancy of privacy-related factors at semantic level. Our framework can provide qualitative (i.e., risk level) and quantitative (i.e., risk score) assessment results, both of which help users make decisions to install an app or not. Furthermore, to find the reasonable weight distribution of each factor automatically, we exploit a self-learning weight assignment method, which is based on fuzzy clustering and knowledge dependency theory. We implement a prototype system and evaluate the effectiveness of SPRisk with 192,445 normal apps and 7,111 malicious apps. A measurement study further reveals some interesting findings, such as the privacy risk distribution of Google Play Store, the diversity of official and unofficial marketplaces, which provide insights into understanding the seriousness of privacy threat in the Android ecosystem.}

Detection is attained on the very first encounter with OPC malware, and hence without any prior knowledge of their code and data. We architected the integration of a decoy network interface controller (DNIC) with a layer of kernel code that emulates a target OPC machine. A DNIC displays a (nonexistent) network, which the compromised machine appears to be connected to. OPC emulation displays a valid (but nonexistent) target OPC machine, which appears to be reachable from the compromised machine over the (nonexistent) network. Our code intercepts OPC malware during their search for target machines over the network. Its overall architecture is crafted to validate the infection by leveraging OPC protocol mechanics. The same principles of operation are used to recognize goodware that access a DNIC by accident. Safe co-existence with production functions and real I/O devices is ensured by a monitor filter driver, which removes all decoy data bound for the monitor. We tested our DNIC architectural developments against numerous OPC malware samples involved in the Dragonfly cyber espionage campaign, and discuss the findings in the paper.}

Given that such channels are audible to participants they are considered more resistant to active attacks, i.e., the attack signal would be heard by the participants. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this assumption using two prominent acoustic self-jamming systems implementations. We show that basic overshadowing attacks are possible in these systems and that these attacks cannot be effectively detected by the participants if the attacker is close to the receiving device. Finally, we propose a novel physical-layer solution for effectively detecting overshadowing attacks, which can improve state-of-the-art acoustic self-jamming systems by ensuring channel integrity while not requiring fundamental modifications to these schemes.}

	abstract = {Biometric Cryptosystems for secret binding such as fuzzy vault and fuzzy commitment are provable secure and offers a convenient way for secret management and protection. Despite numerous practical schemes have been reported, they are deficient in resisting several security and privacy attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-cryptosystem that based on the three key ingredients namely Index of Maximum (IoM) hashing,\n(m,k)\nthreshold secret sharing and b -band mini vaults notion. The IoM hashing is motivated from the ranking based Locality Sensitive Hashing theory meant for non-invertible transformation. On the other hand, the\n(m,k)\nthreshold secret sharing scheme and the b -band mini vaults manage overcome inherent limitations of biometric cryptosystems when integrated with IoM hashing. The proposed scheme strikes the balance between performance and the privacy/security protection. Unlike fuzzy vault and fuzzy commitment, which primarily devised for unordered and binary biometrics, respectively, our scheme is tailored for feature vector-based biometrics (vectorial biometrics). Comprehensive experiments on fingerprint vectors that derived from several FVC fingerprint benchmarks and rigorous analysis demonstrate decent secret retrieval performance yet offer strong resilience against six major security and privacy attacks.}

	abstract = {Recently, many studies have demonstrated deep neural network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by the adversarial example, which is crafted via introducing some perturbations into an original sample. Accordingly, some powerful defense techniques were proposed. However, existing defense techniques often require modifying the target model or depend on the prior knowledge of attacks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for detecting adversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified off-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of noise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar quantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image entropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for different kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be effectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks. More than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models are used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different attack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a high overall F1 score of 96.39 percent and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware attacks.}

This paper focuses on one such method that aims at the detection of attacks that compromise one or more actuators and sensors in a plant either through successful intrusion in the plant's communication network or directly through the plant computers. The method, labelled as Distributed Attack Detection (DAD), detects attacks in real-time by identifying anomalies in the behavior of the physical process in the plant. Anomalies are identified by using monitors that are implementations of invariants derived from the plant design. Each invariant must hold either throughout the plant operation, or when the plant is in a given state. The effectiveness of DAD was assessed experimentally on an operational water treatment plant named SWaT that is a near-replica of commercially available large treatment plants. The method used in DAD was found to be effective in detecting stealthy and coordinated attacks.}

	abstract = {Internet users receive various online social networks (OSNs) services, however, providers of OSNs do not always provide users fine-grained privacy protection mechanisms with sufficient privacy protection for shared resources. In this paper, we propose a formal Group-Based Access Control (oGBAC) framework for preventing privacy disclosure when sharing information within or among groups in OSNs. Our framework extends the group-centric Secure Information Sharing (g-SIS) models by adapting the concept of the group to OSNs. We impose some restrictions to the group and information flow among groups to ensure that operations cannot incur privacy disclosure when sharing information among friends in OSNs. In view of characteristics of OSNs and the requirements of secure information flow, the oGBAC model also incorporates some ideas from the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to develop information flow based rules using relationship among attributes (such as tags, time and security levels) of objects and subjects in OSNs. Administration related rules and access related rules are designed for each access operation of group based OSNs' information sharing. The security of oGBAC model is analyzed using formal methods. To demonstrate the usability of the oGBAC model, we implement the model with the Comparative Attribute-Based Encryption (CCP-CABE), and analyze the security and efficiency of the implemented system to prove the effectiveness of the implemented system.}

	abstract = {Task matching in crowdsourcing has been extensively explored with the increasing popularity of crowdsourcing. However, privacy of tasks and workers is usually ignored in most of exiting solutions. In this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving task matching for crowdsourcing with multiple requesters and multiple workers. Instead of utilizing proxy re-encryption, we propose a proxy-free task matching scheme for multi-requester/multi-worker crowdsourcing, which achieves task-worker matching over encrypted data with scalability and non-interaction. We further design two different mechanisms for worker revocation including Server-Local Revocation (SLR) and Global Revocation (GR), which realize efficient worker revocation with minimal overhead on the whole system. The proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Decisional q-Combined Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (q-DCDBH) assumption. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and detailed simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art work.}

	abstract = {Blockchain has led the trend of decentralized applications and shown great use beyond cryptocurrencies. Decentralized storage such as Storj and Sia leverages blockchain to establish an open platform for sharing economy, which provides private and reliable file-outsourcing services. However, the ubiquitous keyword search function over encrypted files is yet to be supported. To enable this function, we first apply searchable encryption techniques to the decentralized setting. But this primitive can hardly ensure the service integrity. The reason is that decentralized storage commonly faces severe threats from both clients and service peers. Service peers may return partial or incorrect results, while clients may intentionally slander the service peers to avoid payments. To address these threats, we utilize the smart contract to record the logs of encrypted search (aka evidence) on the blockchain, and devise a fair protocol to handle disputes and issue fair payments. Using a dynamic-efficient searchable encryption scheme as an instantiation, we craft a concrete scheme that preserves encrypted search capability and enforces ecosystem healthiness, so that service peers are incentivized to make real efforts and jointly guarantee service reliability. We implement our scheme in Python and Solidity, and test its search performance and transaction costs on Ethereum.}

	abstract = {Proxy re-encryption (PRE) provides a promising solution for encrypted data sharing in public cloud. When data owner Alice is going to share her encrypted data with data consumer Bob, Alice generates a re-encryption key and sends it to the cloud server (proxy); by using it, the proxy can transform Alice's ciphertexts into Bob's without learning anything about the underlying plaintexts. Despite that existing PRE schemes can prevent the proxy from recovering Alice's secret key by collusion attacks with Bob, due to the inherent functionality of PRE, it is inevitable that the proxy and Bob together are capable to gain and distribute Alices decryption capabilities. Even worse, the malicious proxy can deny that it has leaked the decryption capabilities and has very little risk of getting caught. To tackle this problem, we introduce the concept of Accountable Proxy Re-Encryption (APRE), whereby if the proxy is accused to abuse the re-encryption key for distributing Alice's decryption capability, a judge algorithm can decide whether it is innocent or not. We then present a non-interactive APRE scheme and prove its CPA security and accountability under DBDH assumption in the standard model. Finally, we show how to extend it to a CCA secure one.}

	abstract = {With the wide deployment of security mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), memory disclosures have become a prerequisite for critical memory-corruption attacks (e.g., code-reuse attack)-adversaries are forced to exploit memory disclosures to circumvent ASLR as the first step. As a result, the security threats of memory disclosures are now significantly aggravated-they break not only data confidentiality but also the effectiveness of security mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a general detection methodology and develop a system to stop memory disclosures. We observe that memory disclosures are not root causes but rather consequences of a variety of hard-to-detect program errors such as memory corruption and uninitialized read. We thus propose a replicated execution-based methodology to generally detect memory disclosures, regardless of their causes. We realize this methodology with Buddy: By seamlessly maintaining two identical running instances of a target program and diversifying only its target data, Buddy can accurately detects memory disclosures of the data, as doing so will result in the two instances outputting different values. Extensive evaluation results show that Buddy is reliable and efficient while stopping real memory disclosures such as the Heartbleed leak.}

	abstract = {Container technology provides a lightweight operating system level virtual hosting environment. Its emergence profoundly changes the development and deployment paradigms of multi-tier distributed applications. However, due to the incomplete implementation of system resource isolation mechanisms in the Linux kernel, some security concerns still exist for multiple containers sharing an operating system kernel on a multi-tenancy container-based cloud service. In this paper, we first present the information leakage channels we discovered that are accessible within containers. Such channels expose a spectrum of system-wide host information to containers without proper resource partitioning. By exploiting such leaked host information, it becomes much easier for malicious adversaries (acting as tenants in a container cloud) to launch attacks that might impact the reliability of cloud services. We demonstrate that the information leakage channels could be exploited to infer private data, detect and verify co-residence, build covert channels, and launch more advanced cloud-based attacks. We discuss the root causes of the containers' information leakage and propose a two-stage defense approach. As demonstrated in the evaluation, our defense is effective and incurs trivial performance overhead.}

	abstract = {When coming to perform shortest distance queries on encrypted graph data outsourced in external storage infrastructure such as cloud, a significant challenge is how to compute the shortest distance in an accurate, efficient and secure way. This issue is addressed by a recent work, which makes use of somewhat homomorphic encryption (SWHE) to encrypt distance values output by a 2-hop cover labeling (2HCL) scheme. However, it may import large errors and even yield negative results. Besides, SWHE would be too inefficient for normal clients. In this paper, we propose GENOA, a novel Graph ENcryption scheme for shOrtest distAnce queries. GENOA employs only efficient symmetric-key primitives while significantly enhances the accuracy compared to the prior work. As a reasonable trade-off, it additionally reveals the order information among queried distance values in the 2HCL index. We theoretically prove the accuracy and security of GENOA under rigorous cryptographic model. Detailed experiments on eight real-world graphs demonstrate that GENOA is efficient and can produce almost exact results.}

	abstract = {Moving Target Defense (MTD) has recently emerged as a game changer in the security landscape due to its proven potential to introduce asymmetric uncertainty that gives the defender a tactical advantage over the attacker. Many different MTD techniques have been developed, but, despite the huge progress made in this area, critical gaps still exist with respect to the problem of studying and quantifying the cost and benefits of deploying MTDs. In fact, all existing techniques address a very narrow set of attack vectors, and, due to the lack of shared metrics, it is difficult to quantify and compare multiple techniques. Building on our preliminary work in this field, we propose a quantitative analytic model for assessing the resource availability and performance of MTDs, and a method for maximizing a utility function that captures the tradeoffs between security and performance. The proposed model generalizes our previous model and can be applied to a wider range of MTDs and operational scenarios to improve availability and performance by imposing limits on the maximum number of resources that can be in the process of being reconfigured. The analytic results are validated by simulation and experimentation, confirming the accuracy of our model.}

	abstract = {Compact E-cash achieves an efficient system by withdrawing 2n coins within O(1) operations and storing the coins in O(n) bits. For preventing a double-spender from cheating again, it is necessary to trace his e-coins. So full-tracing in compact E-cash system means tracing double-spender and tracing his coins. However, the efficiency problem caused by coin-tracing without TTP (trusted third party) has not been solved. For solving this problem, we introduce a non-standard construction into zero-knowledge proof of payment protocol, which leaks coin information when double-spending but is proven to be perfect zero-knowledge to verifier when spending a coin only once. Therefore, it achieves tracing dishonest users' coins and preserving the anonymity of honest users. Comparing with the existing most efficient method of coin-tracing without TTP, we improve computational complexity from O(k) to O(1) with less storage space. In addition, to improve efficiency and practicality further, batch-spending (spending any number of coins in one operation) and compact-spending (spending all coins in one operation) had been proposed. Based on the non-standard zero-knowledge proof, our scheme provides more efficient batch/compact-spending. Moreover, we also make a comparison with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Lightning Network, which have attracted considerable attention.}

However, recent works have demonstrated that these pervasively computerized modern automobiles are susceptible to security attacks that could compromise the physical safety of the driver and/or passengers. In this paper, we propose a novel ECU architecture for automotive cyber-physical systems (CPS) that simultaneously integrates both security and dependability primitives in the design with negligible performance, energy, and resources overhead. We implement our proposed ECU architecture on Xilinx Automotive (XA) Spartan-6 FPGA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture using a steer-by-wire (SBW) application over controller area network (CAN) with flexible data rate (CAN FD) as a case study. We also optimize and implement a prior secure and dependable automotive work on NXP quad-core iMX6Q SABRE automotive board. We quantify the performance, energy, and error resilience of our proposed architecture for the SBW case study. Results reveal that our proposed architecture can attain a speedup of 47.9× while consuming 2.4× lesser energy than the optimized SABRE board implementation of security and dependability primitives. We further perform a comparative analysis of prior designs and the proposed ECU architecture for different in-vehicle networks, viz., CAN, CAN FD, and FlexRay. Results verify the feasibility as well as the superiority of the proposed ECU over other prior designs in terms of response time, energy efficiency, and error resilience.}

	abstract = {Compared with conventional authentication schemes, which utilize cryptographic mechanisms and operate at an upper layer, authentication at the physical (PHY) layer possesses many advantages, such as, higher information-theoretic security by introducing uncertainty to an adversary, better efficiency, and better compatibility by avoiding any operations at the upper layer. An effective PHY-layer authentication scheme should consider covertness, security, and robustness together. However, in published literature, these three properties have been separately analyzed. This paper proposes a generic security model for PHY-layer authentication, and we design a new systematic metric, which is referred to as the probability of security authentication (PSA). According to the proposed generic security model, we can not only systematically analyze the effect of the parameter of a certain PHY-layer authentication scheme on the final performance, but also fairly compare the performance of different PHY-layer authentication schemes under the same channel conditions at the legitimate and adversary receivers. For performance analysis, the probability of detection (PD) and the probability of false alarm (PFA) of two PHY-layer authentication schemes over fading channels are defined, and their closed-form expressions are well derived. On the basis of the proposed generic security model, a systematic performance comparison between different PHY-layer schemes is provided.}

	abstract = {The widespread use of mobile devices and location-based services has generated a large number of mobility databases. While processing these data is highly valuable, privacy issues can occur if personal information is revealed. The prior art has investigated ways to protect mobility data by providing a wide range of Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs). However, the privacy level of the protected data significantly varies depending on the protection mechanism used, its configuration and on the characteristics of the mobility data. Meanwhile, the protected data still needs to enable some useful processing. To tackle these issues, we present PULP, a framework that finds the suitable protection mechanism and automatically configures it for each user in order to achieve user-defined objectives in terms of both privacy and utility. PULP uses nonlinear models to capture the impact of each LPPM on data privacy and utility levels. Evaluation of our framework is carried out with two protection mechanisms from the literature and four real-world mobility datasets. Results show the efficiency of PULP, its robustness and adaptability. Comparisons between LPPMs' configurators and the state of the art further illustrate that PULP better realizes users' objectives, and its computation time is in orders of magnitude faster.}

In this paper, a malware feature images generation method is used to combine the static analysis of malicious code with the methods of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). By using an RNN, our method considers not only the original information of malware but also the ability to associate the original code with timing characteristics; furthermore, the process reduces the dependence on category labels of malware. Then, we use minhash to generate feature images from the fusion of the original codes and the predictive codes from the RNN. Finally, we train a CNN to classify feature images. When we trained very few samples (the proportion of the sample size of training dataset to validation dataset was 1:30), we obtained accuracy over 92 percent. When we adjust the proportion to 3:1, the accuracy exceeds 99.5 percent. As shown in confusion matrices, our method obtains a good result, where the worst false positive rate of all the malware families is 0.0147 and the average false positive rate is 0.0058.}

	abstract = {There has been a prolific rise in the popularity of cloud storage in recent years. While cloud storage offers many advantages such as flexibility and convenience, users are typically unable to tell or control the actual locations of their data. This limitation may affect users' confidence and trust in the storage provider, or even render cloud unsuitable for storing data with strict location requirements. To address this issue, we propose a system called LAST-HDFS which integrates Location-Aware Storage Technique (LAST) into the open source Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The LAST-HDFS system enforces location-aware file allocations and continuously monitors file transfers to detect potentially illegal transfers in the cloud. Illegal transfers here refer to attempts to move sensitive data outside the (“legal”) boundaries specified by the file owner and its policies. Our underlying algorithms model file transfers among nodes as a weighted graph, and maximize the probability of storing data items of similar privacy preferences in the same region. We equip each cloud node with a socket monitor that is capable of monitoring the real-time communication among cloud nodes. Based on the real-time data transfer information captured by the socket monitors, our system calculates the probability of a given transfer to be illegal. We have implemented our proposed framework and carried out an extensive experimental evaluation in a large-scale real cloud environment to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system.}

In this paper, we lift the attack surface concept to the network level as a formal security metric for evaluating the resilience of networks against zero day attacks. Specifically, we first develop novel models for aggregating the attack surface of different network resources. We then design heuristic algorithms to estimate the network attack surface while reducing the effort spent on calculating attack surface for individual resources. Finally, the proposed methods are evaluated through experiments.}

	abstract = {Application-level access control is a top priority when hardening software applications. In particular, run-time customization of access control policies and separation for concerns are becoming increasingly important. While these requirements are generally well-supported for request-response applications, there is a lack of support for data-focused operations, such as search or data aggregation, in a multi-tier architecture. Moreover, an ability to specify fine-grained access control policies is generally lacking for such applications. This puts at risk the security of organizations that employ existing and emerging database technologies and requires solutions that alleviate this issue. This paper approaches this issue through query rewriting. We present Sequoia, a data access middleware that enables attribute-based, application-level access control in data-driven applications. The middleware enforces external access control policies on data-focused operations such as search and aggregation queries by means of query rewriting based on dynamic run-time conditions. Sequoia provides run-time enforcement of policies that is scalable with regard to the database size. This paper presents an extensible architecture for both relational databases and document stores. It discusses the rewriting approach, and provides a formal verification of equivalencyand an extensive evaluation that shows that this approach scales better than the current state of practice and is an important track for future research.}

	abstract = {Android shared storage is shared with all the applications (apps for short) and the user. It is common to see that a large amount of apps store different kinds of files on it. It is well known that apps granted the read or write permissions can freely access any files in the shared storage. As a consequence, the shared storage has been demonstrated to expose sensitive information and jeopardize users' privacy. In this paper, we systematically study a simple but overlooked threat related to the shared storage-the lack of input validation (e.g., integrity verifications) when consuming files on the shared storage. We argue that the untrusted input from the shared storage is a much ubiquitous problem. By undertaking an empirically study through a static analysis tool we develop, we find over 30 percent of the 13,746 analyzed popular apps on the market suffer from such problem. By investigating the types of files consumed, we find shockingly a large fraction of apps store and consume sensitive files, which allows us to construct end-to-end attacks. Considering the ubiquity of this class of vulnerabilities, we finally define better access control policies for external storage to eliminate them for most apps.}

In particular, organized and stealthy adversaries can launch various types of data falsification attacks from multiple meters using smart or persistent strategies. In this paper, we propose a real time, two tier attack detection scheme to detect orchestrated data falsification under a sophisticated threat model in decentralized micro-grids. The first detection tier monitors whether the Harmonic to Arithmetic Mean Ratio of aggregated daily power consumption data is outside a normal range known as safe margin. To confirm whether discrepancies in the first detection tier is indeed an attack, the second detection tier monitors the sum of the residuals (difference) between the proposed ratio metric and the safe margin over a frame of multiple days. If the sum of residuals is beyond a standard limit range, the presence of a data falsification attack is confirmed. Both the `safe margins' and the `standard limits' are designed through a `system identification phase', where the signature of proposed metrics under normal conditions are studied using real AMI micro-grid data sets from two different countries over multiple years. Subsequently, we show how the proposed metrics trigger unique signatures under various attacks which aids in attack reconstruction and also limit the impact of persistent attacks. Unlike metrics such as CUSUM or EWMA, the stability of the proposed metrics under normal conditions allows successful real time detection of various stealthy attacks with ultra-low false alarms.}

	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has been widely recognized as an effective way to implement and consolidate hardware-based network functions by using software-based approaches, with a potential to significantly reducing CAPEX and OPEX. In particular, NFV orchestrators (e.g., Tacker, Cloudify, and ONAP) play a vital role in managing and orchestrating various virtualized network resources (e.g., VMs, Virtualized Network Functions), and TOSCA is one of the standard data models to fulfil such a role. However, it remains unclear how the security mechanisms can be seamlessly integrated into the entire lifecycle of those virtualized network assets. Starting with a comparative analysis on the available NFV orchestrators, we extend the TOSCA model to incorporate security attributes of interest, and leverage the extended model to create access control policies at cloud scale. Specifically, a security orchestrator is developed, which contains a TOSCA-parser and a novel tenant-specific access control paradigm. One of the salient features of our security orchestrator is that it allows to dynamically generate access control models and policies for different tenant domains, resulting in a flexible and scalable protection coverage that is across different NFV layers and multiple data centers. To validate its feasibility and effectiveness, we develop a security orchestrator prototype and test its performance with respect to throughput, scalability, and adaptability. The experimental results demonstrate that all the desirable properties can be achieved, and the throughput of our security orchestrator can be maintained at a satisfactory level regardless of the varying number of tenants, users, or objects that are deployed in the cloud.}

	abstract = {Thanks to the popularity of mobile devices numerous location-based services (LBS) have emerged. While several privacy-preserving solutions for LBS have been proposed, most of these solutions do not consider the fact that LBS are typically cloud-based nowadays. Outsourcing data and computation to the cloud raises a number of significant challenges related to data confidentiality, user identity and query privacy, fine-grained access control, and query expressiveness. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for outsourcing LBS to the cloud. The framework supports multi-location queries with fine-grained access control, and search by location attributes, while providing semantic security. In particular, the framework implements a new model that allows the user to govern the trade-off between precision and privacy on a dynamic per-query basis. We also provide a security analysis to show that the proposed scheme preserves privacy in the presence of different threats. We also show the viability of our proposed solution and scalability with the number of locations through an experimental evaluation, using a real-life OpenStreetMap dataset.}

	abstract = {This paper improves the performance of the revised-simplified verifiable re-encryption mixnet (R-SVRM) based e-voting scheme by introducing confirmation numbers (CNs) that are used in the CN based e-voting scheme. Although CN based and R-SVRM based schemes had made e-voting schemes more practical by excluding zero knowledge proof (ZKP) that requires large volume of computations, still they are not efficient enough. Namely, the CN based scheme adopts RSA encryption functions that are not probabilistic or commutative, therefore to satisfy essential requirements of elections, extra random factors are necessary for individual votes, election authorities must sign on votes and they must keep encryption keys as their secrets. On the other hand, although the R-SVRM based scheme uses ElGamal encryption functions that are probabilistic and commutative, vote forms in it is complicated, i.e., vote forms consist of at least 3 items and they include information about candidates as exponents. The improved scheme simplifies vote forms by exploiting CNs, and extensively reduces the number of operations required for individual votes. Also, the scheme successfully satisfies all essential requirements of e-voting systems, i.e., it is endowed with features about privacy, robustness, accuracy, incoercibility and fairness as CN based and R-SVRM based schemes are.}

The algorithms are designed for high identification accuracy by removing noise frequency components and for high efficiency in terms of computation complexity.

The identification accuracy can reach 100% with only 30 seconds of smartphone traffic.}

	abstract = {Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise-based source camera attribution is a popular digital forensic method. In this method, a camera fingerprint computed from a set of known images of the camera is matched against the extracted noise of an anonymous questionable image to find out if the camera had taken the anonymous image. The possibility of privacy leak, however, is one of the main concerns of the PRNU-based method. Using the camera fingerprint (or the extracted noise), an adversary can identify the owner of the camera by matching the fingerprint with the noise of an image (or with the fingerprint computed from a set of images) crawled from a social media account. In this article, we address this privacy concern by encrypting both the fingerprint and the noise using the Boneh-Goh-Nissim (BGN) encryption scheme, and performing the matching in encrypted domain. To overcome leakage of privacy from the content of an image that is used in the fingerprint calculation, we compute the fingerprint within a trusted environment, such as ARM TrustZone. We present e-PRNU that aims at minimizing privacy loss and allows authorized forensic experts to perform camera attribution. The security analysis shows that the proposed approach is semantically secure. Experimental results show that the run-time computational overhead is 10.26 seconds when a cluster of 64 computing nodes are used.}

	abstract = {Spectrum trading benefits both secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs), while it poses great challenges to maximize PUs’ revenue, since SUs’ demands are uncertain and individual SU's traffic portfolio contains private information. In this paper, we propose a data-driven spectrum trading scheme which maximizes PUs’ revenue and preserves SUs’ demand differential privacy. Briefly, we introduce a novel network architecture consisting of the primary service provider (PSP), the secondary service provider (SSP) and the secondary traffic estimator and database (STED). Under the proposed architecture, PSP aggregates available spectrum from PUs, and sells the spectrum to SSP at fixed wholesale price, directly to SUs at spot price, or both. The PSP has to accurately estimate SUs’ demands. To estimate SUs’ demand, the STED exploits data-driven approach to choose sampled SUs to construct the reference distribution of SUs’ demands, and utilizes reference distribution to estimate the demand distribution of all SUs. Moreover, the STED adds noises to preserve the demand differential privacy of sampled SUs before it answers the demand estimation queries from the PSP. With the estimated SUs’ demand, we formulate the revenue maximization problem into a risk-averse optimization, develop feasible solutions, and verify its effectiveness through both theoretical proof and simulations.}

Among various information-release cases, medical document release has gained significant attention for its potential in improving healthcare service quality and efficacy. However, integrity and origin authentication of released medical documents is the priority in subsequent applications. Moreover, sensitive nature of much of this information also gives rise to a serious privacy threat when medical documents are uncontrollably made available to untrusted third parties. Redactable signatures allow any party to delete pieces of an authenticated document while guaranteeing the origin and integrity authentication of the resulting (released) subdocument. Nevertheless, most of existing redactable signature schemes (RSSs) are vulnerable to dishonest redactors or illegal redaction detection. To address the above issues, we propose two distinct RSSs with flexible release control (RSSs-FRC). We also analyse the performance of our constructions in terms of security, efficiency and functionality. The analysis results show that the performance of our construction has significant advantages over others, from the aspects of security and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) has been widely applied in the encrypted database for queries in practice. Although SSE is powerful and feature-rich, it is always plagued by information leaks. Some recent attacks point out that forward privacy which disallows leakage from update operations, now becomes a basic requirement for any newly designed SSE schemes. However, the subsequent search operations can still leak a significant amount of information. To further strengthen security, we extend the definition of forward privacy and propose the notion of “forward search privacy”. Intuitively, it requires search operations over newly added documents do not leak any information about past queries. The enhanced security notion poses new challenges to the design of SSE. We address the challenges by developing the hidden pointer technique (HPT) and propose a new SSE scheme called Khons, which satisfies our security notion (with the original forward privacy notion) and is also efficient. We implemented Khons and our experiment results on large dataset (wikipedia) show that it is more efficient than existing SSE schemes with forward privacy.}

Current efforts have focused mainly on the security issue and protocol design of the techniques under passive attack and jamming attack. In this paper, we raise the subject of manipulative attack. The attacker wants the keying devices to actually agree on some valid, but manipulated bits. We discuss the feasibility and different means to launch manipulative attack. Aiming at a practical countermeasure, we further propose PHY-UIR (PHYsical layer key agreement with User Introduced Randomness). Both keying devices generate and use random voltage levels X = {x[1], x[2] ... x[N]} and Y = {y[1], y[2] ... y[N]} to exchange probing frames over reciprocal random fading channels H = {h[1], h[2] ... h[N]}. At receiving end, they multiply the received channel measurements XH and YH with the random sequences Y and X to compose a common keying sequence XYH. With this solution, the attacker can no longer manipulate the keying sequences established at legitimate sides and infer the subsequent key. We analyze the security strength of PHY-UIR and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate it. We also perform proof-of-concept experiments by using software defined radios in a real-world environment. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PHY-UIR.}

	abstract = {Verifiable Searchable Symmetric Encryption, as an important cloud security technique, allows users to retrieve the encrypted data from the cloud through keywords and verify the validity of the returned results. Dynamic update for cloud data is one of the most common and fundamental requirements for data owners in such schemes. To the best of our knowledge, the existing verifiable SSE schemes supporting data dynamic update are all based on asymmetric-key cryptography verification, which involves time-consuming operations. The overhead of verification may become a significant burden due to the sheer amount of cloud data. Therefore, how to achieve keyword search over dynamic encrypted cloud data with efficient verification is a critical unsolved problem. To address this problem, we explore achieving keyword search over dynamic encrypted cloud data with symmetric-key based verification and propose a practical scheme in this paper. In order to support the efficient verification of dynamic data, we design a novel Accumulative Authentication Tag (AAT) based on the symmetric-key cryptography to generate an authentication tag for each keyword. Benefiting from the accumulation property of our designed AAT, the authentication tag can be conveniently updated when dynamic operations on cloud data occur. In order to achieve efficient data update, we design a new secure index composed by a search table ST based on the orthogonal list and a verification list VL containing AATs. Owing to the connectivity and the flexibility of ST, the update efficiency can be significantly improved. The security analysis and the performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.}

	abstract = {Network traffic analysis has been increasingly used in various applications to either protect or threaten people, information, and systems. Website fingerprinting is a passive traffic analysis attack which threatens web navigation privacy. It is a set of techniques used to discover patterns from a sequence of network packets generated while a user accesses different websites. Internet users (such as online activists or journalists) may wish to hide their identity and online activity to protect their privacy. Typically, an anonymity network is utilized for this purpose. These anonymity networks such as Tor (The Onion Router) provide layers of data encryption which poses a challenge to the traffic analysis techniques. Although various defenses have been proposed to counteract this passive attack, they have been penetrated by new attacks that proved the ineffectiveness and/or impracticality of such defenses. In this work, we introduce a novel defense algorithm to counteract the website fingerprinting attacks. The proposed defense obfuscates original website traffic patterns through the use of double sampling and mathematical optimization techniques to deform packet sequences and destroy traffic flow dependency characteristics used by attackers to identify websites. We evaluate our defense against state-of-the-art studies and show its effectiveness with minimal overhead and zero-delay transmission to the real traffic.}

	abstract = {Today, major corporations and government organizations must face the reality that they will be hacked by malicious actors. In this paper, we consider the case of defending enterprises that have been successfully hacked by imposing additional a posteriori costs on the attacker. Our idea is simple: for every real document d\n, we develop methods to automatically generate a set Fake(d)\nof fake documents that are very similar to d\n. The attacker who steals documents must wade through a large number of documents in detail in order to separate the real one from the fakes. Our \\mathsf {FORGE}\nsystem focuses on technical documents (e.g., engineering/design documents) and involves three major innovations. First, we represent the semantic content of documents via multi-layer graphs (MLGs). Second, we propose a novel concept of “meta-centrality” for multi-layer graphs. A meta-centrality (MC) measure takes a classical centrality measure (for ordinary graphs, not MLGs) as input, and generalizes it to MLGs. The idea is to generate fake documents by replacing concepts on the basis of meta-centrality with related concepts according to an ontology. Our third innovation is to show that the problem of generating the set Fake(d)\nof fakes can be viewed as an optimization problem. We prove that this problem is NP-complete and then develop efficient heuristics to solve it in practice. We ran detailed experiments on two datasets: one a panel of 20 human subjects, another with a panel of 10. Our results show that \\mathsf {FORGE}\ngenerates highly believable fakes.}

	abstract = {Proof of Storage (PoS) enables a cloud storage provider to prove that a client's data is intact. However, existing PoS protocols are not designed for the pay-as-you-go business model in which payment is made based on both storage volume and duration. In this paper, we propose two PoS protocols suitable for the pay-as-you-go storage business model. The first is a time encapsulated Proof of Retrievability (PoR) protocol that ensures retrievability of the original file upon successful auditing by a client. Considering the large size of outsourced data, we then extend the protocol to a privacy-preserving public auditing protocol which allows a third party auditor to audit outsourced data on behalf of its clients without sacrificing the privacy of the data or the timestamp (i.e., time of storage). We formalize the definition, system model and security model of the proposed PoS system and prove the security of the proposed protocols by a sequence of games in the algebraic group model with a random oracle. We analyze the performance of the protocols both theoretically and experimentally and show that the protocols are practical.}

	abstract = {Successful deployment of autonomous systems in a wide range of societal applications depends on error-free operation of the underlying signal processing and control functions. Real-time error detection in nonlinear systems has mostly relied on redundancy at the component or algorithmic level causing expensive area and power overheads. This paper describes a real-time error detection methodology for nonlinear control systems for detecting sensor and actuator degradations as well as malfunctions due to soft errors in the execution of the control algorithm on a digital processor. Our approach is based on creation of a redundant check state in such a way that its value can be computed from the current states of the system as well as from a history of prior observable state values and inputs (via machine learning algorithms). By checking for consistency between the two, errors are detected with low latency. The method is demonstrated on two test case simulations - an inverted pendulum balancing problem and a sliding mode controller driven brake-by-wire (BBW) system. In addition, hardware results from error injection experiments in an ARM core representation on an FPGA and artificial sensor degradations on a self-balancing robot prove the practical feasibility of implementation.}

This scheme incorporates all necessary protocols, hardware, and software components to provide protection against many known potential attacks including internal attacks. It achieves perfect forward secrecy, provides FPGA authentication and integrity checks, and securely establishes a symmetric session key between the user and the FPGA. A complete prototype has been implemented to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme with current FPGAs. Experimental results showed that an FPGA-based compute node can be set up in a cloud in 3.36s; 12.6 times faster than booting a medium-size conventional Virtual Machine (VM) on the same cloud. Based on the average global Internet speed, the time it takes to set up the FPGA-based machine from anywhere in the world was estimated to be 15s. Also, running an experimental secure image processing application on the FPGA took 50 percent less time than running the same application on a conventional state-of-the art processor (without a secure container).}

	abstract = {Cloud-based systems are subject to various attack types launched by Virtual Machines (VMs) manipulated by attackers having different goals and skills. The existing detection and defense mechanisms might be suitable for simple attack environments but become ineffective when the system faces advanced attack scenarios wherein simultaneous attacks of different types are involved. This is because these mechanisms overlook the attackers' strategies in the detection system's design, ignore the system's resource constraints, and lack sufficient knowledge about the attackers' types and abilities. To address these shortcomings, we propose a repeated Bayesian Stackelberg game consisting of the following phases: risk assessment framework that identifies the VMs' risk levels, live-migration-based defense mechanism that protects services from being successful targets for attackers, machine-learning-based technique that collects malicious data from VMs using honeypots and employs one-class Support Vector Machine to learn the attackers' types distributions, and resource-aware Bayesian Stackelberg game that provides the hypervisor with the detection load's optimal distribution over VMs that maximizes the detection of multi-type attacks. Experiments conducted using Amazon's datacenter and Amazon Web Services honeypot data reveal that our solution maximizes the detection, minimizes the number of attacked services, and runs efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art detection and defense strategies, namely Collabra, probabilistic migration, Stackelberg, maxmin, and fair allocation.}

	abstract = {In this article, we propose and evaluate three different state recovery algorithms aimed for Paxos-one of the most popular distributed agreement protocols. Paxos is commonly used to maintain consistency among state machine replicas despite of failures of processes. The first algorithm, that we call FullSS, originates from the original Paxos and requires that the system frequently uses stable storage during regular (non-faulty) execution. The other two state recovery algorithms, ViewSS and EpochSS, scarcely require access to stable storage, and the recovering process must do much less work to restore its lost state, and to catch up on the current state of the system. We thoroughly analyze and compare the behavior of the three algorithms during state recovery and also during regular, non-faulty system execution, under various workloads (e.g., causing the network or CPU saturation). The experimental results show that by using ViewSS and EpochSS, we can significantly improve process recovery with respect to the original Paxos, if only it can be assumed that at any time a majority of replicas are up running (excluding those replicas that are just recovering). Moreover, these algorithms do not impact the performance of Paxos during regular (non-faulty) operation. However, FullSS is the only choice out of the three, if the system must tolerate catastrophic failures.}

Our NIZK scheme is perfect zero knowledge in the common reference string model, while its soundness holds in the random oracle model.

Unfortunately, as the profit potential grows higher, the chances of these Apps getting attacked also get higher. Therefore, developers improved the security of their Apps, which limits attackers ability to compromise upgraded versions of the Apps. However, developers cannot enhance the security of earlier versions that have been released on the Play Store. The earlier versions of the App can be subject to reverse engineering and other attacks. In this paper, we find that attackers can use these earlier versions as attack vectors, which threatens well protected upgraded versions. We show how to attack the upgraded versions of some popular Apps, including Facebook, Sina Weibo and Qihoo360-Cloud-Driven by analyzing the vulnerabilities existing in their earlier versions. We design and implement a tool named DroidSkynet to analyze and find out vulnerable apps from the Play Store. Among 1,500 mainstream Apps collected from the real world, our DroidSkynet indicates the success rate of attacking an App using an earlier version is 34 percent. We also explore possible mitigation solutions to achieve a balance between utility and security of the App update process.}

	abstract = {In cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems, side-channel attacks have been used to reconstruct the G/M-code (which are instructions given to a manufacturing system) of 3D objects being produced. This method is effective for stealing intellectual property from an organization, through least expected means, during prototyping stage before the product goes through a large-scale fabrication and comes out in the market. However, an attacker can be far from being able to completely reconstruct the G/M-code due to lack of enough information leakage through the side-channels. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amplify the information leakage and thus boost the chances of recovery of G/M-code by surreptitiously altering the compiler. By using this compiler, an adversary may easily control various parameters to magnify the leakage of information from a 3D printer while still producing the desired object, thus remaining hidden from the authentic users. This type of attack may be implemented by strong attackers having access to the tool chain and seeking high level of stealth. We have implemented such a compiler and have demonstrated that it increases the success rate of recovering G/M-codes from the four side-channels (acoustic, power, vibration, and electromagnetic) by up to 39 percent compared to previously proposed attacks.}

However, many criminal activities might be committed with the protection of anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions. Thus, user accountability (or traceability) is also important in Monero transactions, which is unfortunately lacking in the current literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a new cryptocurrency named Traceable Monero to balance the user anonymity and accountability. Our framework relies on a tracing authority, but is optimistic, in that it is only involved when investigations in certain transactions are required. We formalize the system model and security model of Traceable Monero. We present a detailed construction of Traceable Monero by overlaying Monero with two types of tracing mechanisms, tracing the one-time addresses with money flows and tracing the long-term addresses. We prove the security of Traceable Monero and implement a prototype of the system, which demonstrates that Traceable Monero incurs merely a very small overhead in generating and verifying a transaction compared to Monero transactions.}

Most of existing reversible data hiding methods are based on stream ciphers, which are mainly concerned with data storage security. While homomorphic ciphers focus on data processing security, which is popular in cloud and other third-party platforms. Reversible data hiding with homomorphic cryptography has been an active topic in the research filed. In this paper, we propose a new lossless data hiding method based on homomorphic cryptosystem. After a content owner generates encrypted media with homomorphic ciphers, a data hider embeds secret data by establishing a mapping between secret bits and losslessly modifying encrypted media. At the receiver side, the embedded data is extracted from encrypted domain with a little auxiliary message. And original media is recovered by directly decrypting marked encrypted media. During the embedding process, the modification of encrypted media does not change the corresponding original media owing to homomorphic and probabilistic properties. Thus, no distortion is introduced in the whole procedures of data embedding. And directly decrypted media containing embedded data is the same as the original media. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves a high embedding rate through efficient mapping and skillful use of expanded pixel values. The experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has higher embedding rate without distortion.}

Emerging cloud storage services provide a better paradigm to support the needs of such applications. Such cloud based solutions introduce additional security and privacy challenges when dealing with outsourced data including that of supporting fine-grained access control over such data stored in the cloud. In this paper, we propose an integrated, privacy-preserving user-centric attribute based access control framework to ensure the security and privacy of users' data outsourced and stored by a cloud service provider (CSP). The core component of the proposed framework is a novel privacy-preserving, revocable ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (PR-CP-ABE) scheme. To support advanced access control features like write access on encrypted data and privacy-preserving access policy updates, we propose extended Path-ORAM access protocol that can also prevent privacy disclosure of access patterns. We also propose an integrated secure deduplication approach to improve the storage efficiency of CSPs while protecting data privacy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework and compare it with other existing solutions with regards to the security and performance issues.}

Achieving fast authentication during the message verification process is usually challenging in such strategies and further they suffer performance constraints from resulting overheads. To address such challenges, this paper proposes a novel Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme for securing vehicular authentication. The proposed protocol only requires realistic TPDs, and eliminates the need for pre-loading the master key onto the vehicle's TPDs. Chinese remainder theorem can dynamically assist the trusted authorities (TAs) whilst generating and broadcasting new group keys to the vehicles in the network. The proposed scheme solves the leakage problem during side channel attacks, and ensures higher level of security for the entire system. In addition, the proposed scheme avoids using the bilinear pairing operation and map-to-point hash operation during the authentication process, which helps achieving faster verification even under increasing number of signature. Moreover, the security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is secure under the random oracle model and the performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in reducing computation and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a new and largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems. This article introduces CuRTAIL, a novel end-to-end computing framework to characterize and thwart potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. This, in turn, ensures the effectiveness of the defense in the face of generic attacks. We evaluate the robustness of our proposed methodology against the state-of-the-art adaptive attacks in a white-box setting considering that the adversary knows everything about the victim model and its defenders. Extensive evaluations for analyzing MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet data corroborate the effectiveness of CuRTAIL framework against adversarial samples. The computations in each modular redundancy can be performed independently of the other redundancy modules. As such, CuRTAIL detection algorithm can be completely parallelized among multiple hardware settings to achieve maximum throughput. We further provide an open-source Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate the adoption of the proposed framework for various applications.}

	abstract = {Wearable technology is increasingly being used for medical applications such as continuous monitoring of chronically ill patients in homes and hospitals. The various stakeholders (patients, doctors, insurers) have an interest in ensuring not only that the data is untampered, but also that the context is verifiable (e.g., correct time and location can be associated with the data collected). Prior works have studied these aspects in isolation, typically using cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we develop a new solution that leverages the density of wireless devices in the vicinity of the transaction to create witness records ensuring data is tamper-protected and bound to its time and location context. Our first contribution is to develop a secure logging architecture that compacts witness records using Bloom filters and hash-chains them to bind them to the data, allowing fast and reliable forensic verification. Our second contribution is to identify the various configuration parameters influencing the performance of our scheme in terms of storage, processing, and transmission efficiency, and to quantify their effect on verification accuracy. Our third contribution implements and demonstrates the feasibility of our scheme, and quantifies its efficacy via simulation using real trace data from a multi-storey building representing a hospital environment.}

	abstract = {Enabling cryptographically enforced access controls for data hosted in untrusted cloud is attractive for many users and organizations. However, designing efficient cryptographically enforced dynamic access control system in the cloud is still challenging. In this paper, we propose Crypt-DAC, a system that provides practical cryptographic enforcement of dynamic access control. Crypt-DAC revokes access permissions by delegating the cloud to update encrypted data. In Crypt-DAC, a file is encrypted by a symmetric key list which records a file key and a sequence of revocation keys. In each revocation, a dedicated administrator uploads a new revocation key to the cloud and requests it to encrypt the file with a new layer of encryption and update the encrypted key list accordingly. Crypt-DAC proposes three key techniques to constrain the size of key list and encryption layers. As a result, Crypt-DAC enforces dynamic access control that provides efficiency, as it does not require expensive decryption/re-encryption and uploading/re-uploading of large data at the administrator side, and security, as it immediately revokes access permissions. We use formalization framework and system implementation to demonstrate the security and efficiency of our construction.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of publishing vertically partitioned data under differential privacy, where different attributes of the same set of individuals are held by multiple parties. In this setting, with the assistance of a semi-trusted curator, the involved parties aim to collectively generate an integrated dataset while satisfying differential privacy for each local dataset. Based on the latent tree model (LTM), we present a differentially private latent tree (DPLT) approach, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to solving this challenging problem. In DPLT, the parties and the curator collaboratively identify the latent tree that best approximates the joint distribution of the integrated dataset, from which a synthetic dataset can be generated. The fundamental advantage of adopting LTM is that we can use the connections between a small number of latent attributes derived from each local dataset to capture the cross-dataset dependencies of the observed attributes in all local datasets such that the joint distribution of the integrated dataset can be learned with little injected noise and low computation and communication costs. DPLT is backed up by a series of novel techniques, including two-phase latent attribute generation (TLAG), tree index based correlation quantification (TICQ) and distributed Laplace perturbation protocol (DLPP). Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that DPLT offers desirable data utility with low computation and communication costs.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection can infer the presence of errors without observing the target services, but detecting variations in the observable parts of the system on which the services reside. This is a promising technique in complex software-intensive systems, because either instrumenting the services' internals is exceedingly time-consuming, or encapsulation makes them not accessible. Unfortunately, in such systems anomaly detection is often ineffective due to their dynamicity, which implies changes in the services or their expected workload. Here we present our approach to enhance the efficacy of anomaly detection in complex, dynamic software-intensive systems. After discussing the related challenges, we present MADneSs, an anomaly detection framework tailored for the above systems that includes an adaptive multi-layer monitoring module. Monitored data are then processed by the anomaly detector, which adapts its parameters depending on the current system behavior. An anomaly alert is provided if the analysis conducted by the anomaly detector identify unexpected trends in the data. MADneSs is evaluated through an experimental campaign on two service-oriented architectures; software faults are injected in the application layer, and detected through monitoring of underlying system layers. Lastly, we quantitatively and qualitatively discuss our results with respect to state-of-the-art solutions, highlighting the key contributions of MADneSs.}

	abstract = {Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) against malicious attacks is of paramount importance because these attacks may cause irreparable damages to physical systems. Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.}

	abstract = {Hosting content delivery networks (CDNs) on clouds has the potential to improve the performance as resources and caches can be placed closer to subscribers. However, avoiding data leakage over an untrusted public cloud is critical, especially for sensitive data such as the SSL private key. The popular Keyless SSL solution allows content owners to retain on-premise custody of SSL private keys on their own key servers, but this solution likely causes performance bottlenecks and impedes the elasticity of CDNs. This paper describes a novel key management system, named STYX, for transmitting trusted data over untrusted channels and storing them on untrusted platforms. STYX accomplishes secure key provisioning for CDN scale-out and the key is securely protected with full revocation rights for CDN scale-in. STYX is implemented as a three-phase hierarchical key management scheme by leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and QuickAssist Technology (QAT). Furthermore, STYX supports CDN services by integrating Nginx as the SSL termination proxy and the popular Redis/Memcached/Apache as backend caching engines. The performance evaluation shows that STYX significantly outperforms the native HTTPS servers on the CDN node due to QAT acceleration, providing up to a 5× enhancement in throughput and a 50 percent reduction in latency.}

With the increased heterogeneity and densification of 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets), it is important to ensure security and efficiency of frequent handovers in 5G wireless roaming environments. However, existing handover authentication mechanisms still have challenging issues, such as anonymity, robust traceability and universality. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing RUSH, a Robust and Universal Seamless Handover authentication protocol for 5G HetNets. In RUSH, anonymous mutual authentication with key agreement is enabled for handovers by exploiting the trapdoor collision property of chameleon hash functions and the tamper-resistance of blockchains. RUSH achieves universal handover authentication for all the diverse mobility scenarios, as exemplified by the handover between 5G new radio and non-3GPP access regardless of the trustworthiness of non-3GPP access and the consistency of the core network. RUSH also achieves perfect forward secrecy, master key forward secrecy, known randomness secrecy, key escrow freeness and robust traceability. Our formal security proofs based on the BAN-logic and formal verification based on AVISPA indicate that RUSH resists various attacks. Comprehensive performance evaluation and comparisons show that RUSH outperforms other schemes in both computation and communication efficiencies.}

	abstract = {Achieving secure communication between an Implantable Medical Device (IMD) and a gateway or programming device outside the body has showed its criticality in recent reports of vulnerabilities in cardiac devices, insulin pumps and neural implants, amongst others. The use of asymmetric cryptography is typically not a practical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and power resources. Symmetric key cryptography is preferred but its security relies on agreeing and using strong keys, which are difficult to generate. A solution to generate strong shared keys without using extensive resources, is to extract them from physiological signals already present inside the body such as the Inter-Pulse interval (IPI). The physiological signals must therefore be strong sources of randomness that meet five conditions: Universality (available on all people), Liveness (available at any-time), Robustness (strong random number), Permanence (independent from its history) and Uniqueness (independent from other sources). However, these conditions (mainly the last three) have not been systematically examined in current methods for randomness extraction from IPI. In this study, we first propose a methodology to measure the last three conditions: Information secrecy measures for Robustness, Santha-Vazirani Source delta value for Permanence and random sources dependency analysis for Uniqueness. Then, using a large dataset of IPI values (almost 900,000,000 IPIs), we show that IPI does not have Robustness and Permanence as a randomness source. Thus, extraction of a strong uniform random number from IPI values is impossible. Third, we propose to use the trend of IPI, instead of its value, as a source for a new randomness extraction method named Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI (MRE-IPI). We evaluate MRE-IPI and show that it satisfies the Robustness condition completely and Permanence to some level. Finally, we use the NIST STS and Dieharder test suites and show that MRE-IPI is able to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and achieves a quality roughly half that of the AES random number generator. MRE-IPI is still not a strong random number and cannot be used as key to secure communications in general. However, it can be used as a one-time pad to securely exchange keys between the communication parties. The usage of MRE-IPI will thus be kept at a minimum and reduces the probability of breaking it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in this area which uses such a comprehensive method and large dataset to examine the randomness of physiological signals.}

	abstract = {Recently, Personal Data Storage (PDS) has inaugurated a substantial change to the way people can store and control their personal data, by moving from a service-centric to a user-centric model. PDS offers individuals the capability to keep their data in a unique logical repository, that can be connected and exploited by proper analytical tools, or shared with third parties under the control of end users. Up to now, most of the research on PDS has focused on how to enforce user privacy preferences and how to secure data when stored into the PDS. In contrast, in this paper we aim at designing a Privacy-aware Personal Data Storage (P-PDS), that is, a PDS able to automatically take privacy-aware decisions on third parties access requests in accordance with user preferences. The proposed P-PDS is based on preliminary results presented in [1] , where it has been demonstrated that semi-supervised learning can be successfully exploited to make a PDS able to automatically decide whether an access request has to be authorized or not. In this paper, we have deeply revised the learning process in order to have a more usable P-PDS, in terms of reduced effort for the training phase, as well as a more conservative approach w.r.t. users privacy, when handling conflicting access requests. We run several experiments on a realistic dataset exploiting a group of 360 evaluators. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Data in its original form, however, typically contain sensitive information about individuals. Directly publishing raw data will violate the privacy of people involed. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to preserve the privacy of published data. An attacker is apt to identify an individual from the published tables, with attacks through the record linkage, attribute linkage, table linkage or probabilistic attack. Although algorithms based on generalization and suppression have been proposed to protect the sensitive attributes and resist these multiple types of attacks, they often suffer from large information loss by replacing specific values with more general ones. Alternatively, anatomization and permutation operations can de-link the relation between attributes without modifying them. In this paper, we propose a scheme Sensitive Label Privacy Preservation with Anatomization (SLPPA) to protect the privacy of published data. SLPPA includes two procedures, table division and group division. During the table division, we adopt entropy and mean-square contingency coefficient to partition attributes into separate tables to inject uncertainty for reconstructing the original table. During the group division, all the individuals in the original table are partitioned into non-overlapping groups so that the published data satisfies the pre-defined privacy requirements of our (\nα,β,γ,δ\n) model. Two comprehensive sets of real-world relationship data are applied to evaluate the performance of our anonymization approach. Simulations and privacy analysis show our scheme possesses better privacy while ensuring higher utility.}

Integer error is a common yet important C program defect because arithmetic operations may produce unrepresentable values in certain integer types. Integer error is one of the major sources of software failures and vulnerabilities. Due to the complex semantics of C integers, manually repairing integer errors is prone to introducing additional errors even for experienced programmers. This paper presents an approach to automatically generate fixes for integer errors. Our approach infers, for each expression, a type that is capable of representing its possible values, and utilizes inferred types as program fixes based on common fix patterns codified from real world. We have developed our system IntPTI which is evaluated on the largest public benchmark of integer errors and 7 widely-used open-source projects. The evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of IntPTI in terms of accuracy, scalability, runtime overhead and robustness of fixes. In addition, IntPTI is applied on the embedded software of a realistic train control system. It succeeds in both detecting 67 new integer errors and generating 101 fixes confirmed by developers. The study substantiates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

	abstract = {Robust codes can effectively detect jamming in q-ary memories for q = 2 t . When q is not a power of two, a binary information word has to be converted into a q-ary word prior to the encoding. This conversion expurgates the code since some of the q-ary codewords are never used. Unless properly designed, expurgation can significantly degrade the effectiveness of the code in terms of its error detection capability. This article analyzes the error masking probability of an expurgated robust code when applied to q-ary memories. It is shown that by wisely designing the converter, this degradation can be minimized, and in some cases, the code's efficiency can be superior to the original code.}

	abstract = {Trustworthiness in an online environment is essential because individuals and organizations can easily be misled by false and malicious information receiving from untrustworthy users. Though existing methods assess users' trustworthiness by exploiting Twitter account properties, their efficacy is inadequate because of Twitter's restriction on profile and tweet size, the existence of missing or insufficient profiles, and ease to create fake accounts or relationships to pretend as trustworthy. In this paper, we present a holistic approach by exploiting ideas perceived from real-world organizations for trust estimation along with available Twitter information. Users' trustworthiness is determined by considering their credentials, recommendation from referees and the quality of the information in their Twitter accounts and tweets. We establish the feasibility of our approach analytically and further devise a multi-objective cost function for the A* search to find a quasi-optimal path between the trust evaluator and the user whose trustworthiness is being evaluated. We also propose an incentive mechanism to increase user participation in the trust evaluation process, and a threat model and trustworthiness measure of referees to thwart the possibility of providing an untruthful recommendation to inflate one's trustworthiness. The efficacy of our proposed approach is validated through experiments using Twitter data and extensive simulation in various scenarios.}

	abstract = {In mobile crowdsourcing, organizers usually need participants' precise locations for optimal task allocation, e.g., minimizing selected workers' travel distance to task locations. However, the exposure of users' locations raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a location privacy-preserving task allocation framework with geo-obfuscation to protect users' locations during task assignments. More specifically, we make participants obfuscate their reported locations under the guarantee of two rigorous privacy-preserving schemes, differential and distortion privacy, without the need to involve any third-party trusted entity. In order to achieve optimal task allocation with the differential-and-distortion geo-obfuscation, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem to minimize the expected travel distance of the selected workers under the constraints of differential and distortion privacy. Moreover, a worker may be willing to accept multiple tasks, and a task organizer may be concerned with multiple utility objectives such as task acceptance ratio in addition to travel distance. Against this background, we also extend our solution to the multi-task allocation and multi-objective optimization cases. Evaluation results on both simulation and real-world user mobility traces verify the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, our framework outperforms Laplace obfuscation, a state-of-the-art geo-obfuscation mechanism, by achieving up to 47 percent shorter average travel distance on real-world data under the same level of privacy protection.}

The basic LDP frequency oracle protocol enables the aggregator to estimate the frequency of any value. But when the domain of input values is large, finding the most frequent values, also known as the heavy hitters, by estimating the frequencies of all possible values, is computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose an LDP protocol for identifying heavy hitters. In our proposed protocol, which we call Prefix Extending Method (PEM), users are divided into groups, with each group reporting a prefix of her value. We analyze how to choose optimal parameters for the protocol and identify two design principles for designing LDP protocols with high utility. Experiments show that under the same privacy guarantee and computational cost, PEM has better utility on both synthetic and real-world datasets than existing solutions.}

It is a challenging problem, however, due to the difficulties of handling complex social network topologies and conducting accurate assessment in these topologies. To address these challenges, we model trust by proposing the three-valued subjective logic (3VSL) model. 3VSL properly models the uncertainties that exist in trust, thus is able to compute trust in arbitrary graphs. We theoretically prove the capability of 3VSL based on the Dirichlet-Categorical (DC) distribution and its correctness in arbitrary OSN topologies. Based on the 3VSL model, we further design the AssessTrust (AT) algorithm to accurately compute the trust between any two users connected in an OSN. We validate 3VSL against two real-world OSN datasets: Advogato and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Experimental results indicate that 3VSL can accurately model the trust between any pair of indirectly connected users in the Advogato and PGP.}

	abstract = {As one of a few critical technologies to cloud storage service, deduplication allows cloud servers to save storage space by deleting redundant file copies. However, it often leaks side channel information regarding whether an uploading file gets deduplicated or not. Exploiting this information, adversaries can easily launch a template side-channel attack and severely harm cloud users' privacy. To thwart this kind of attack, we resort to the k-anonymity privacy concept to design secure threshold deduplication protocols. Specifically, we have devised a novel cryptographic primitive called “dispersed convergent encryption” (DCE) scheme, and proposed two different constructions of it. With these DCE schemes, we successfully construct secure threshold deduplication protocols that do not rely on any trusted third party. Our protocols not only support confidentiality protections and ownership verifications, but also enjoy formal security guarantee against template side-channel attacks even when the cloud server could be a “covert adversary” who may violate the predefined threshold and perform deduplication covertly. Experimental evaluations show our protocols enjoy very good performance in practice.}

	abstract = {Cloud-assisted Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) relies on cloud computing to provide massive data storage services. To ensure the confidentiality, sensitive industrial data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to cloud storage server. Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) enables users to search target encrypted data by keywords. However, most existing PEKS schemes are based on conventional hardness assumptions, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum computers in the near future. Moreover, they suffer from key exposure, and thus the security would be broken once the keys are compromised. In this paper, we propose a forward secure PEKS scheme (FS-PEKS) based on lattice assumptions for cloud-assisted IIoT, which is post-quantum secure. We integrate a lattice-based delegation mechanism into FS-PEKS to achieve forward security, such that the security of the system is still guaranteed even the keys are compromised by the adversaries. We define the first formal security model on forward security of PEKS, and prove the security of FS-PEKS under the model. As the keywords of industrial data are with inherently low entropy, we further extend FS-PEKS to resist insider keyword guessing attacks (IKGA). The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that FS-PEKS is practical for cloud-assisted IIoT.}

This paper performs a systematic study to understand the whole ecosystem of fraudulent dating apps. Specifically, we have proposed a three-phase method to detect them and subsequently comprehend their characteristics via analyzing the existing account profiles. Our observation reveals that most of the accounts are not managed by real persons, but by chatbots based on predefined conversation templates. We also analyze the business model of these apps and reveal that multiple parties are actually involved in the ecosystem, including producers who develop apps, publishers who publish apps to gain profit, and the distribution network that is responsible for distributing apps to end users. Finally, we analyze the impact of them to users (i.e., victims) and estimate the overall revenue. Our work is the first systematic study on fraudulent dating apps, and the results demonstrate the urge for a solution to protect users.}

However, sensitive data could be exposed to malicious entities if brokers get compromised or hacked; or even worse, if brokers themselves are curious to learn about the data. A viable mechanism to protect sensitive publications and subscriptions is to encrypt the data before it is disseminated through the brokers. State-of-the-art approaches allow brokers to perform encrypted matching without revealing publications and subscriptions. However, if malicious brokers collude with malicious subscribers or publishers, they can learn the interests of innocent subscribers, even when the interests are encrypted. In this article, we present a pub/sub system that ensures confidentiality of publications and subscriptions in the presence of untrusted brokers. Furthermore, our solution resists collusion attacks between untrusted brokers and malicious subscribers (or publishers).

	abstract = {Cryptographic implementations are often vulnerable against physical attacks, fault injection analysis being among the most popular techniques. On par with development of attacks, the area of countermeasures is advancing rapidly, utilizing both hardware- and software-based approaches. When it comes to software encoding countermeasures for fault protection and their evaluation, there are very few proposals so far, mostly focusing on single operations rather than cipher as a whole. In this paper we propose an evaluation framework that can be used for analyzing the effectivity of software encoding countermeasures against fault attacks. We first formalize the encoding schemes in software, helping us to define what properties are required when designing a fault protection. Based on these findings, we develop an evaluation metric that can be used universally to determine the robustness of a software encoding scheme against bit flip faults and instruction skips. We provide a way to select a code according to user criteria and also a dynamic code analysis method to estimate the level of protection of assembly implementations using encoding schemes. Finally, we verify our findings by implementing a block cipher PRESENT, protected by encoding scheme based on anticodes, and provide a detailed evaluation of this implementation using different codes.}

	abstract = {Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Keyword Search (CP-ABKS) facilitates search queries and supports fine-grained access control over encrypted data in the cloud. However, prior CP-ABKS schemes were designed to support unshared multi-owner setting, and cannot be directly applied in the shared multi-owner setting (where each record is accredited by a fixed number of data owners), without incurring high computational and storage costs. In addition, due to privacy concerns on access policies, most existing schemes are vulnerable to off-line keyword-guessing attacks if the keyword space is of polynomial size. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify malicious users who leak the secret keys when more than one data user has the same subset of attributes. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving CP-ABKS system with hidden access policy in Shared Multi-owner setting (basic ABKS-SM system), and demonstrate how it is improved to support malicious user tracing (modified ABKS-SM system). We then prove that the proposed ABKS-SM systems achieve selective security and resist off-line keyword-guessing attack in the generic bilinear group model. We also evaluate their performance using real-world datasets.}

	abstract = {A smart home enables users to access devices such as lighting, HVAC, temperature sensors, and surveillance camera. It provides a more convenient and safe living environment for users. Security and privacy, however, is a key concern since information collected from these devices are normally communicated to the user through an open network (i.e. Internet) or system provided by the service provider. The service provider may store and have access to these information. Emerging smart home hubs such as Samsung SmartThings and Google Home are also capable of collecting and storing these information. Leakage and unauthorized access to the information can have serious consequences. For example, the mere timing of switching on/off of an HVAC unit may reveal the presence or absence of the home owner. Similarly, leakage or tampering of critical medical information collected from wearable body sensors can have serious consequences. Encrypting these information will address the issues, but it also reduces utility since queries is no longer straightforward. Therefore, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme, \\sf PrivHomePrivHome. It supports authentication, secure data storage and query for smart home systems. PrivHome provides data confidentiality as well as entity and data authentication to prevent an outsider from learning or modifying the data communicated between the devices, service provider, gateway, and the user. It further provides privacy-preserving queries in such a way that the service provider, and the gateway does not learn content of the data. To the best of our knowledge, privacy-preserving queries for smart home systems has not been considered before. Under our scheme is a new, lightweight entity and key-exchange protocol, and an efficient searchable encryption protocol. Our scheme is practical as both protocols are based solely on symmetric cryptographic techniques. We demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme based on experimental and simulation results, as well as comparisons to existing smart home security protocols.}

Prior work on attacking voice assistants shows that the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control the VAs. Hidden voice commands, though `hidden', are nonetheless audible. In this work, we design a completely inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers to achieve inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the modulated low-frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated, recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the voice assistants. We validate DolphinAttack on popular voice assistants, including Siri, Google Now, S Voice, HiVoice, Cortana, Alexa, etc. By injecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime call on iPhone, activating Google Now to turn on the airplane mode, and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose hardware and software defense solutions. We validate that it is feasible to detect DolphinAttack by classifying the audios using supported vector machine (SVM), and suggest to re-design voice assistants to be resilient to inaudible voice command attacks.}

	abstract = {Due to the lightweight features, the combination of container technology and microservice architecture makes container-based cloud environment more efficient and agile than VM-based cloud environment. However, it also greatly amplifies the dynamism and complexity of the cloud environment and increases the uncertainty of security issues in the system concurrently. In this case, the effectiveness of defense mechanisms with fixed strategies would fluctuate as the updates occur in cloud environment. We refer this problem as effectiveness drift problem of defense mechanisms, which is particularly acute in the proactive defense mechanisms, such as moving target defense (MTD). To tackle this problem, we present DSEOM, a framework that can automatically perceive updates of container-based cloud environment, rapidly evaluate the effectiveness change of MTD and dynamically optimize MTD strategies. Specifically, we establish a multi-dimensional attack graphs model to formalize various complex attack scenarios. Combining with this model, we introduce the concept of betweenness centrality to effectively evaluate and optimize the implementation strategies of MTD. In addition, we present a series of security and performance metrics to quantify the effectiveness of MTD strategies in DSEOM. And we conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the existence of the effectiveness drift problem and demonstrate the usability and scalability of DSEOM.}

	abstract = {Most state-of-the-art halftone image steganographic techniques only consider the flipping distortion according to the human visual system, which are not always secure when they are attacked by steganalyzers. In this paper, we propose a halftone image steganographic scheme that aims to generate stego images with good visual quality and strong statistical security of anti-steganalysis. First, the concept of pixel density is proposed and a novel construction called pixel density histogram (PDH) is proposed to design a “embedding” scheme for halftone images. Then, we optimize density pair selection to select density blocks that can improve visual quality. Finally, the messages are embedded through pixel density transition, where a novel pixel flipping strategy is proposed, which can maintain the structural dependence by optimizing the pixel mesh Markov transition matrix (PMMTM). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed steganography scheme can achieve strong statistical security of anti-steganalysis with good visual quality without degrading the embedding capacity.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework called IDEA that exploits electromagnetic (EM) side-channel signals to detect malicious activity on embedded and cyber-physical systems (CPS). IDEA first records EM emanations from an uncompromised reference device to establish a baseline of reference EM patterns. IDEA then monitors the target device's EM emanations. When the observed EM emanations deviate from the reference patterns, IDEA reports this as an anomalous or malicious activity. IDEA does not require any resource or infrastructure on, or any modification to, the monitored system itself. In fact, IDEA is isolated from the target device, and monitors the device without any physical contact. We evaluate IDEA by monitoring the target device while it is executing embedded applications with malicious code injections such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Ransomware and code modification. We further implement a control-flow hijack attack, an advanced persistent threat, and a firmware modification on three CPSs: an embedded medical device called SyringePump, an industrial Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller, and a Robotic Arm, using a popular embedded system, Arduino UNO. The results demonstrate that IDEA can detect different attacks with excellent accuracy (AUC > 99.5%, and 100 percent detection with less than 1 percent false positives) from distances up to 3 m.}

	abstract = {Remote desktop protocols (RDP) are commonly used for connecting and interacting with computers remotely. In this case, a server component runs on the remote computer and shares its desktop (i.e., screen) with the client component which runs on an end user device. In recent years, a number of vulnerabilities have been identified in two widely used remote desktop implementations, Microsoft Remote Desktop and RealVNC. These vulnerabilities may expose the remote server to a new attack vector. This concern is increased when it comes to a cyber-physical system (CPS) in which a client device with a low trust level connects to the critical system via the remote desktop server. In order to mitigate this risk, in this paper we propose a network based intrusion detection system (NIDS) specifically designed for securing the remote desktop connections. The propose method utilizes an innovative anomaly detection technique based on machine learning for detecting malicious TCP packets, which can carry exploits aimed at the RDP server. An empirical evaluation conducted on an avionic system setup consisting of a commercial tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab) connected through a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) remote desktop implementation to a real electronic flight bag (EFB) server shows that the proposed method can detect malicious packets carrying real exploits (reported in recent years) with a true positive rate of 0.863 and a false positive rate of 0.0001.}

Due to the existence of many different types of base stations (BSs) and the complexity of the network topology in the 5G HetNets, there are a lot of new challenges in security and mobility management aspects for this multi-tier 5G architecture including insecure access points and potential frequent handovers among several different types of base stations. In this paper, we integrate user capability and Software Defined Network (SDN) technique, and propose a capability-based privacy protection handover authentication mechanism in SDN-based 5G HetNets. Our proposed scheme can achieve the mutual authentication and key agreement between User Equipments (UEs) and BSs in 5G HetNets at the same time largely reduce the authentication handover cost. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme indeed can provide robust security protection by employing several security analysis methods including the BAN logic and the formal verification tool Scyther. In addition, the performance evaluation results show that our scheme outperforms other existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Cryptography is essential for computer and network security. When cryptosystems are deployed in computing or communication systems, it is extremely critical to protect the cryptographic keys. In practice, keys are loaded into the memory as plaintext during cryptographic computations. Therefore, the keys are subject to memory disclosure attacks that read unauthorized data from RAM. Such attacks could be performed through software exploitations, such as OpenSSL Heartbleed, even when the integrity of the victim system's binaries is maintained. They could also be done through physical methods, such as cold-boot attacks, even if the system is free of software vulnerabilities. This paper presents Mimosa, to protect RSA private keys against both software-based and physical memory disclosure attacks. Mimosa uses hardware transactional memory (HTM) to ensure that (a) whenever a malicious thread other than Mimosa attempts to read the plaintext private key, the transaction aborts and all sensitive data are automatically cleared with hardware, due to the strong atomicity guarantee of HTM; and (b) all sensitive data, including private keys and intermediate states, appear as plaintext only within CPU-bound caches, and are never loaded to RAM chips. To the best of our knowledge, Mimosa is the first solution to use transactional memory to protect sensitive data against memory attacks. However, the fragility of TSX transactions introduces extra cache-clogging denial-of-service (DoS) threats, and attackers could sharply degrade the performance by concurrent memory-intensive tasks. To mitigate the DoS threats, we further partition an RSA private-key computation into multiple transactional parts by analyzing the distribution of aborts, while (sensitive) intermediate results are still protected across transactional parts. Through extensive experiments, we show that Mimosa effectively protects cryptographic keys against attacks that attempt to read sensitive data in memory, and introduces only a small performance overhead, even with concurrent cache-clogging workloads.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become prevalent due to its nature of massive storage and vast computing capabilities. Ensuring a secure data sharing is critical to cloud applications. Recently, a number of identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption (IB-BPRE) schemes have been proposed to resolve the problem. However, the IB-BPRE requires a cloud user (Alice) who wants to share data with a bunch of other users (e.g., colleagues) to participate the group shared key renewal process because Alice's private key is a prerequisite for shared key generation. This, however, does not leverage the benefit of cloud computing and causes the inconvenience for cloud users. Therefore, a novel security notion named revocable identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption (RIB-BPRE) is presented to address the issue of key revocation in this work. In a RIB-BPRE scheme, a proxy can revoke a set of delegates, designated by the delegator, from the re-encryption key. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical.}

Prior work has shown that sonification can present network-security information to humans effectively, and indicated that security practitioners foresee potential for sonification to aid in scenarios related to their work. The use of sonification by security practitioners in tasks relevant to SOCs has not been examined, however. To address this gap, we assessed the use of sonification by security practitioners in network-security monitoring tasks in an experimental setting. We report on the results of a study in which we compared the performance of security practitioners using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool with their performance using a SIEM tool that incorporated sonification, in a primary and a non-primary monitoring task. In both tasks, a number of aspects of the monitoring performance of participants were significantly improved when sonification was used. Our results support the potential for sonification to aid in SOC tasks, and indicate a need to validate the utility of sonification systems by running them in operational SOCs.}

	abstract = {Truth discovery has received considerable attention in mobile crowdsensing systems. In real practice, it is vital to resolve conflicts among a large amount of sensory data and estimate the truthful information. Although truth discovery has been widely explored to improve aggregation accuracy, numerous security and privacy issues still need to be addressed. Existing schemes either do not guarantee the privacy of each participating user, or fail to consider practical needs in crowdsensing systems. In this paper, we present two reliable and privacy-preserving truth discovery schemes for different scenarios. Our first design is fit for applications where users are relatively stable. By employing the homomorphic Paillier encryption, one-way hash chain, and super-increasing sequence techniques, this approach not only guarantees strong privacy, but also is highly efficient and practical. Our second design suits applications where users are frequently moving. In such an application, we explore data perturbation and homomorphic Paillier encryption to shift all user workloads to the server side, without compromising users' privacy. Through detailed security analysis, we demonstrate that both schemes are secure, practical, and privacy-preserving. Moreover, extensive experiments based on real world and simulated mobile crowdsensing systems, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes.}

To handle the explosive image growth, a natural choice nowadays is cloud computing. However, coming with the cloud-based image services is acute data privacy concerns, which has to be well addressed. In this paper, we present a secure cloud-based image service framework, which allows privacy-preserving and effective image denoising on the cloud side to produce high-quality image content, a key for assuring the quality of various image-centric applications. We resort to state-of-the-art image denoising techniques based on deep neural networks (DNNs), and show how to uniquely bridge cryptographic techniques (like lightweight secret sharing and garbled circuits) and image denoising in depth to support privacy-preserving DNN based image denoising services on the cloud. By design, the image content and the DNN model are all kept private along the whole cloud-based service flow. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that our security design is able to achieve denoising quality comparable to that in plaintext, with high cost efficiency on the local side and practically affordable cost on the cloud side.}

To convenient access to the services and protect the privacy of communication in the public network, three-factor Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement (MAKA) protocols for multi-server architectures gain wide attention. However, most of the existing three-factor MAKA protocols don't provide a formal security proof resulting in various attacks on the related protocols, or they have high computation and communication costs. And most of the three-factor MAKA protocols haven't a dynamic revocation mechanism, which leads to malicious users can not be promptly revoked. To address these drawbacks, we propose a provable dynamic revocable three-factor MAKA protocol that achieves the user dynamic management using Schnorr signatures and provides a formal security proof in the random oracle. Security analysis shows that our protocol can meet various demands in the multi-server environments. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is well suited for computing resource constrained smart devices. The full version of the simulation implementation proves the feasibility of the protocol.}

	abstract = {Ridesharing allows multiple persons to share one vehicle for their trips instead of using multiple vehicles. Ridesharing can reduce the number of vehicles in the street, which consequently can reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and transportation cost. However, ridesharing organization requires passengers to report sensitive location information about their trips to a trip organizing server (TOS) which creates a serious privacy issue. The existing ridesharing organization schemes are neither flexible nor scalable in the sense that they require a driver and a rider to have exactly the same trip to share a ride, and they are inefficient if applied to large geographic areas. In this paper, we propose two efficient privacy-preserving ridesharing organization schemes for Non-transferable Ridesharing Service (NRS) and Transferable Ridesharing Service (TRS). In NRS, a rider shares a ride from his/her trip's start to the destination with only one driver, whereas, in TRS, a rider can transfer between multiple drivers while en route until he reaches his destination. In the proposed schemes, the ridesharing area is divided into a number of small geographic areas, called cells, and each cell has a unique identifier. Each driver/rider should encrypt his/her trip's data with modified kNN encryption scheme, and send an encrypted ridesharing offer/request to the TOS. In NRS scheme, Bloom filters are used to represent the trip information compactly before encryption. Then, the TOS can measure the similarity of the encrypted trips to organize shared rides without revealing either the users' identities or the locations. In TRS scheme, drivers report their encrypted routes, and then the TOS builds a directed graph that is passed to a modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to search for an optimal path for rides that can achieve a set of preferences prescribed by the riders. Although TRS can be used to organize non-transferable trips, performance evaluation shows that NRS requires less communication overhead than TRS. Our formal privacy proof and analysis demonstrate that the proposed schemes can preserve users privacy and our experimental results using routes extracted from real maps show that the proposed schemes can be used efficiently for large cities.}

	abstract = {E-Healthcare systems are increasingly popular due to the introduction of wearable healthcare devices and sensors. Personal health records (PHRs) are collected by these devices and stored in a remote cloud. Due to privacy concern, these records should not be accessible by any unauthorized party, and the cloud providers should not be able to learn any information from the stored records. To address the above issues, one promising solution is to employ attribute based encryption (ABE) for fine-grained access control and searchable encryption for keyword search on encrypted data. However, most of existing ABE schemes leak the privacy of access policy which may also contain sensitive information. On the other hand, for users' devices with limited computing power and bandwidth, the mechanism should enable them to be able to search the PHRs efficiently. Unfortunately, most existing works on ABE do not support efficient keyword search on encrypted data. In this work, we propose an efficient hidden policy ABE scheme with keyword search. Our scheme enables efficient keyword search with constant computational overhead and constant storage overhead. Moreover, we enhance the recipient's privacy which hides the access policy. As of independent interest, we present a trapdoor malleability attack and demonstrate that some of previous schemes may suffer from such attack.}

	abstract = {With the increasing popularity of digital video communication, video data hiding has become an active research topic in covert communication and privacy protection. Traditional video data hiding methods often use quantized discrete cosine transform (QDCT) coefficients to carry a sufficient payload. However, since QDCT coefficients expose texture features and motion characteristics of the present video frame heavily, data embedding with QDCT coefficients may lead to significant intra-frame distortion and inter-frame distortion drift. To avoid obvious visual artifacts and keep bit-rate within a satisfactory level of the marked video, data embedding in QDCT coefficients should take into account both the intra-frame and inter-frame distortion impacts. It motivates the authors to propose an efficient cost assignment-based video data hiding method in this paper. The proposed cost assignment method aims to accurately evaluate the data embedding distortion. Specifically, the proposed scheme considers intra-frame changes and intra-frame distortion drift, for which the texture and motion changes of frames can be measured. The frame position is also used to reflect a cumulative distortion difference of multiple frames. For data embedding, syndrome-trellis code (STC) is adopted to minimize the overall distortion. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing works in terms of payload-distortion performance.}

	abstract = {Anonymous Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (\\sf APAKEAPAKE) can be seen as the hybrid offspring of standard key exchange and anonymous password authentication protocols. \\sf APAKEAPAKE allows a client holding a low-entropy password to establish a session key with a server, provided that the client's password is in the server's set. Moreover, no information about the password input by the client or the set of valid passwords held by the server should leak to the other party-beyond whether the client's password lies or not in the server's password database. To the best of our knowledge, all \\sf APAKEAPAKE proposals to date either assume client storage or force the client to remember the index assigned to its password in the server's database. Furthermore, earlier works either provide only informal definitions or fail in some sense to properly model the primitive. In this paper, we provide a formal security model for \\sf APAKEAPAKE, capturing security and anonymity provisions for both clients and servers. In addition, we present two \\sf APAKEAPAKE protocols that only require clients to remember a password and that attain our sought key secrecy and anonymity guarantees. Our first protocol leverages oblivious pseudo-random functions, while the second one builds upon a special type of identity-based encryption scheme.}

	abstract = {Cross-media retrieval (CMR) is an attractive networked application where a server responds to queries with retrieval results of different modalities. Different from traditional information retrieval, CMR relies on a more enriched set of machine learning techniques to produce semantic models projecting multimodal data into a common space. A larger training dataset usually gives more accurate models, leading to a better retrieval result. Despite very promising with potential underpinnings in network analytics and multimedia applications, applying CMR in such contexts also faces severe privacy challenges, due to the fact that various data scattering among multiple parties may be sensitive and not allowed to be shared publicly. Studies jointly considering cross-media analytics, privacy protection, collaborative learning, and distributed networking contexts, are relatively sparse. In this work, we propose the first practical system for privacy-preserving cross-media retrieval by utilizing trusted processors. Our scheme enables secure aggregation of the data from distinct parties, and secure canonical correlation analysis (CCA) over collaborated data to obtain semantic models. Verification mechanisms are designed to defend against active attacks from a malicious adversary. Furthermore, to deal with large data sets, we provide a set of optimization methods to accomodate to limited trusted memory and improve the efficiency of training process in CMR. We consider issues such as data block splitting to manage memory overhead, ordering of operations as well as parameters reuse and release to simplify I/O, and parallel computation to speed up dual operations. Our experiments over both synthetic and real datasets show that our solution is very efficient in practice, outperforms the existing solutions, and performs comparably with the original CMR system.}

	abstract = {Modern operating system kernels deploy Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) to mitigate control-flow hijacking attacks. KASLR randomizes the base addresses of the kernel's code and data segments. However, it randomizes both with a single offset and does not randomize the internal layout of either of these segments, so relative addresses remain known to adversaries. If the kernel discloses a single code or global data pointer, an adversary can therefore infer the entire layout of the kernel's code segment and bypass KASLR. In this paper, we present Kernel Address Leak Detector (KALD), a tool that finds direct disclosure vulnerabilities by statically analyzing the kernel source code. KALD can analyze the source code of modern operating system kernels and find previously unreported leaks. KALD compiles a list of functions that can leak information to user-space accessible locations, and it uses the results of a points-to analysis to determine whether individual invocations of such functions can disclose kernel pointers. We show that KALD successfully detects several direct disclosure vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel and that it is flexible enough to be useful in practice.}

	abstract = {Using a novel dataset of Android banking trojans (ABTs), other Android malware, and goodware, we develop the $\\sf {DBank}$ system to predict whether a given Android APK is a banking trojan or not. We introduce the novel concept of a Triadic Suspicion Graph (TSG for short) which contains three kinds of nodes: goodware, banking trojans, and API packages. We develop a novel feature space based on two classes of scores derived from TSGs: suspicion scores (SUS) and suspicion ranks (SR)—the latter yields a family of features that generalize PageRank. While TSG features (based on SUS/SR scores) provide very high predictive accuracy on their own in predicting recent (2016-2017) ABTs, we show that the combination of TSG features with previously studied lightweight static and dynamic features in the literature yields the highest accuracy in distinguishing ABTs from goodware, while preserving the same accuracy of prior feature combinations in distinguishing ABTs from other Android malware. In particular, $\\sf {DBank}$ ’s overall accuracy in predicting whether an APK is a banking trojan or not is up to 99.9% AUC with 0.3% false positive rate. Moreover, we have already reported two unlabeled APKs from VirusTotal (which $\\sf {DBank}$ has detected as ABTs) to the Google Android Security Team—in one case, we discovered it before any of the 63 anti-virus products on VirusTotal did, and in the other case, we beat 62 of 63 anti-viruses on VirusTotal. This suggests that $\\sf {DBank}$ is capable of making new discoveries in the wild before other established vendors. We also show that our novel TSG features have some interesting defensive properties as they are robust to knowledge of the training set by an adversary: even if the adversary uses 90% of our training set and uses the exact TSG features that we use, it is difficult for him to infer $\\sf {DBank}$ ’s predictions on APKs. We additionally identify the features that best separate and characterize ABTs from goodware as well as from other Android malware. Finally, we develop a detailed data-driven analysis of five major recent ABT families: FakeToken , Svpeng , Asacub , BankBot , and Marcher , and identify the features that best separate them from goodware and other-malware.}

	abstract = {As an important security property of cloud storage, data integrity has not been sufficiently studied under the multi-writer model, where a group of users work on shared files collaboratively and any group member can update the data by modification, insertion, and deletion operations. Existing works under such multi-writer model would bring large storage cost to the third-party verifiers. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works for shared files supports fully dynamic operations, which implies that users cannot freely perform the update operations. In this paper, we propose the first public auditing scheme for shared data that supports fully dynamic operations and achieves constant storage cost for the verifiers. Our scheme, named PRAYS, is boosted by a new paradigm for remote data integrity checking. To implement the new paradigm, we proposed a specially designed authenticated structure, called blockless Merkle tree, and a novel cryptographic primitive, called permission-based signature. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that PRAYS is as efficient as the existing less-functional solutions. We believe that PRAYS is an important step towards designing practical multi-writer cloud storage systems.}

	abstract = {At present, wireless home routers are becoming increasingly smart. While these smart routers provide rich functionalities to users, they also raise security concerns. Although the existing end-to-end encryption techniques can be applied to protect personal data, such rich functionalities become unavailable due to the encrypted payloads. On the other hand, if the smart home routers are allowed to process and store the personal data of users, once compromised, the users' sensitive data will be exposed. As a consequence, users face a difficult trade-off between the benefits of the rich functionalities and potential privacy risks. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a novel system named Secure and Smart Network (S2Net) for home routers. For S2Net, we propose a secure OS that can distinguish and manage multiple sessions belonging to different users. The secure OS and all the router applications are placed in the secure world using the ARM TrustZone technology. In S2Net, we also confine the router applications in sandboxes provided by the proposed secure OS to prevent data leakage. As a result, S2Net can provide rich functionalities for users while preserving strong privacy for home routers. In addition, we develop a crypto-worker model that provides an abstraction layer of cryptographic tasks performed by a heterogeneous multi-core system. The other important role of crypto-worker is to parallelize the computations in order to resolve the high computation cost of cryptographic functions. We report the system design of S2Net and the details of our implementation. Experimental results with benchmarks and real applications demonstrate that our implementation is capable of achieving high performance in terms of throughput while mitigating the overhead of S2Net design.}

However, to enjoy ORH services, users need to submit their location information to ORH systems, which raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we study the privacy leakage of online ridesharing matching, a more complex and economy ORH service that allows riders to share rides with others, and propose a privacy-preserving shared ride matching scheme, called PSRide. PSRide can find the taxi with the minimum additional travel time to serve a new rider based on its existing schedule, while protecting the location privacy of both riders and taxis. In PSRide, we propose a zone-based minimum road travel time estimation approach and a secure comparison protocol to efficiently optimize the schedules of taxis for a new rider over encrypted data. We implement PSRide and analyze it thoroughly. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations show that PSRide is secure and efficient for ORH systems.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of various mobile devices equipped with cameras results in an exponential growth of the amount of images. Recent advances in the deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made CNN feature extraction become an effective way to process these images. However, it is still a challenging task to deploy the CNN model on the mobile sensors, which are typically resource-constrained in terms of the storage space, the computing capacity, and the battery life. Although cloud computing has become a popular solution, data security and response latency are always the key issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework for privacy-preserving CNN feature extraction for mobile sensing based on edge computing. To get the most out of the benefits of CNN with limited physical resources on the mobile sensors, we design a series of secure interaction protocols and utilize two edge servers to collaboratively perform the CNN feature extraction. The proposed scheme allows us to significantly reduce the latency and the overhead of the end devices while preserving privacy. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of our scheme.}

	abstract = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) has attracted extensive attention due to its potential to identify a person of interest from different surveillance videos. With the increasing amount of the surveillance videos, high computation and storage costs have posed a great challenge for the resource-constrained users. In recent years, the cloud storage services have made a large volume of video data outsourcing become possible. However, person Re-ID over outsourced surveillance videos could lead to a security threat, i.e., the privacy leakage of the innocent person in these videos. Therefore, we propose an efFicient privAcy-preseRving peRson Re-ID Scheme (FARRIS) over outsourced surveillance videos, which can ensure the privacy of the detected person while providing the person Re-ID service. Specifically, FARRIS exploits the convolutional neural network (CNN) and kernels based supervised hashing (KSH) to extract the efficient person Re-ID feature. Then, we design a secret sharing based Hamming distance computation protocol to allow cloud servers to calculate similarities among obfuscated feature indexes. Furthermore, a dual Merkle hash trees based verification is proposed, which permits users to validate the correctness of the matching results. The extensive experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that FARRIS can work efficiently, without compromising the privacy of the involved person.}

	abstract = {Recent studies demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which would seriously threaten security-sensitive applications. Existing works synthesized the adversarial examples by perturbing the original/benign images by leveraging the\nL\np\n-norm to penalize the perturbations, which restricts the pixel-wise distance between the adversarial images and correspondingly benign images. However, they added perturbations globally to the benign images without explicitly considering their content/spacial structure, resulting in noticeable artifacts especially in those originally clean regions, e.g., sky and smooth surface. In this paper, we propose an invisible adversarial attack, which synthesizes adversarial examples that are visually indistinguishable from benign ones. We adaptively distribute the perturbation according to human sensitivity to a local stimulus in the benign image, i.e., the higher insensitivity, the more perturbation. Two types of adaptive adversarial attacks are proposed: 1) coarse-grained and 2) fine-grained. The former conducts\nL\np\n-norm regularized by the novel spatial constraints, which utilizes the rich information of the cluttered regions to mask perturbation. The latter, called Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-based adversarial attack, utilizes the proposed JND\np\nmetric for better measuring the perceptual similarity, and adaptively sets penalty by weighting the pixel-wise perceptual redundancy of an image. We conduct extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and a comprehensive user study with 50 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that JND\np\nis a better metric for measuring the perceptual similarity than\nL\np\n-norm, and the proposed adaptive adversarial attacks can synthesize indistinguishable adversarial examples from benign ones and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Metric linear-time logic (MTL) has been widely used to specify runtime policies. Traditionally this use of MTL is to capture the qualitative aspects of the monitored systems, but recent developments in its extensions with aggregate operators allow some quantitative policies to be specified. Our interest in MTL-based policy languages is driven by applications in runtime malware or intrusion detection in platforms like Android and autonomous vehicles, which requires the monitoring algorithm to be independent of the length of the system event traces so that its performance does not degrade as the traces grow. We propose a policy language based on a past-time variant of MTL, extended with an aggregate operator called the metric temporal counting quantifier to specify a policy based on the number of times some sub-policies are satisfied in the specified past time interval. We show that a broad class of policies, but not all policies, specified with our language can be monitored in a trace-length independent way, and provide a concrete algorithm to do so. We implement and test our algorithm in both an existing Android monitoring framework and an autonomous vehicle simulation platform, and show that our approach can effectively specify and monitor quantitative policies drawn from real-world studies.}

	abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN) models are known to be vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial examples and to out-of-distribution inputs drawn sufficiently far away from the training data. How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This article presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using 11 popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.}

	abstract = {Cross correlations are ubiquitous in time-series IoT data sets such as trajectories from smartphones and smart meters data in smart grids. Conventional privacy methods have difficulty to protect cross correlation privacy within such correlated data set. Here we propose a novel Correlated noise mechanism for Cross-correlated Data Privacy (CCDP). Because the Fourier coefficients of the cross correlation of two data records are the linear product of those of the two data records, the sanitizing Fourier coefficients noise is used for efficient optimization. Also, the noise is added via the Geometric sum method, which is proved to provide the required Laplace distribution. We perform rigorous mathematical analysis of the CCDP and prove that it satisfies ε-Pufferfish privacy. We also prove that the CCDP can achieve the optimal data utility for a given privacy budget ε. What's more important, we further derive the mathematical procedure to obtain the optimal Laplace noise scale parameter to achieve better data utility. Simulations show that the proposed CCDP outperforms the independent Fourier coefficients noise mechanism, as well as two other state-of-the-art time-domain privacy mechanisms in the literature, for three types of data sets: computer-generated data, real-world trajectory data, and smart meter data.}

	abstract = {Iterative clustering around representative points is an effective technique for clustering and helps us learn insights behind data to support various important applications. Unfortunately, it also provides security holes which may allow adversaries to infer the privacy of individuals with some background knowledge. To protect individual privacy against such inference attacks, preserving differential privacy for iterative clustering algorithms has been extensively studied. Existing differentially private clustering algorithms adopt the same framework to compute differentially private centroids iteratively by running Lloyd's k-means algorithm to obtain the actual centroids, then perturbing them with a differential privacy mechanism. These algorithms suffer from the problem of no convergence guarantee, i.e., they provide no guarantee of termination at a solution of Lloyd's algorithm within a bounded number of iterations. This problem severely impacts their clustering quality and execution efficiency. To address this problem, this article follows the same centroid updating pattern as existing work in interactive settings; however we propose a novel framework for injecting differential privacy into the actual centroids. Specifically, to ensure convergence, we maintain the perturbed centroids of the previous iteration t -1 to compute a convergence zone for each cluster in the current iteration t , where we inject differential privacy noise. To achieve a satisfactory convergence rate, we further control the orientation of centroid movement in each cluster using two strategies: one takes the orientation of centroid movement from iteration t -1 to iteration t (past knowledge); the other uses the additional information of the orientation from iteration t +1 (future knowledge). We prove that, in the expected case, our algorithm (in both strategies) converges to a solution of Lloyd's algorithm in at most twice as many iterations as Lloyd's algorithm. Furthermore, when using both past and future knowledge, we prove that our algorithm converges to the same solution as Lloyd's algorithm (for the same initial centroids) with high probability, at the cost of a slower convergence speed compared to using only past knowledge due to duplicated operations in each iteration required for computing the future knowledge. We perform experimental evaluations on seven widely used real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for interactive differentially private clustering with a guaranteed convergence and better clustering quality whilst meeting the same differential privacy requirements.}

	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) leverages from clouds to simplify and automate the creation and deployment of network services on the fly in a multi-tenant environment. However, clouds may also bring issues leading to tenants' concerns over possible breaches violating the isolation of their deployments. Verifying such network isolation breaches in cloud-enabled NFV environments faces unique challenges. The fine-grained and distributed network access control (e.g., per-function security group rules), which is typical to virtual cloud infrastructures, requires examining not only the events but also the states of all virtual resources using a state-based verification approach. However, verifying the state of a virtual infrastructure may become highly complex and non-scalable due to its sheer size paired with the self-serviced dynamic nature of clouds. In this article, we propose VMGuard, a state-based proactive approach for efficiently verifying large-scale virtual infrastructures in cloud and NFV against network isolation policies. Informally, our key idea is to proactively trigger the verification based on predicted events and their simulated impact upon the current state, such that we can have the best of both worlds, i.e., the efficiency of a proactive approach and the effectiveness of state-based verification. We implement and evaluate VMGuard based on OpenStack, and our experiments with both real and synthetic data demonstrate the performance and efficiency, e.g., less than five milliseconds to perform incremental verification on a dataset with more than 25, 000 VMs and less than two milliseconds with the proactive module enabled.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing, while becoming more and more popular as a dominant computing platform, introduces new security challenges. When virtual machines are deployed in a cloud environment, virtual machine placement strategies can significantly affect the overall security risks of the entire cloud. In recent years, the attacks are specifically designed to co-locate with target virtual machines in the cloud. The virtual machine placement without considering the security risks may put the users, or even the entire cloud, in danger. In this article, we present a fine-grained model to quantify the risk level caused by co-residency. Using a large scale dataset collected from Microsoft Azure Platform, we profile the behavior patterns of normal service subscribers (tenants) using our proposed feature metrics. Tenants are clustered into multiple categories. After the baseline is established based on the normal behavior pattern, the derivation can be evaluated for each category and the high-risk group can be labeled accordingly. With the labeled datasets, a classification component and a quantification component are constructed to dynamically quantify the co-residency risks for a specific virtual machine. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our model to the new data and the accuracy is verified by examination of F-score Matrix.}

	abstract = {The pool-hopping attack casts down the expected profits of both the mining pool and honest miners in Blockchain. The mainstream countermeasures, namely PPS (pay-per-share) and PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-share), can hedge pool hopping but need to charge miners some fees when they join in a pool. Obviously, the higher fee charged, the higher cost of joining the pool, the less motivation of a miner to mine in the pool. In this article, we apply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which offers an incentive mechanism for motivating miners not to switch in pools strategically by economic means without fee charged. In short, the proposed pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is charged if the miner does not hop, 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in both prepaid and postpaid mechanisms, and 3) fairness. Even can dominate the game with any miner, a pool has to cooperate when a miner does not hop among pools, implying that the pool cannot squeeze the honest miners financially. The fairness of our scheme makes it have long-term sustainability. Both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.}

Unfortunately, the existing works have not considered the accumulation and reuse of historical knowledge, as well as the sensitivity of the detection model to different types of attacks, which leads to a low detection accuracy. To address the issue, this article proposes a model based on sustainable ensemble learning. In the model training stage, by taking the individual classifiers probability output and classification confidence as the training data, we build multi-class regression models such that ensemble learning adapts to different attacks. Besides, in the updating stage, an iterative updating method is presented, where the parameters and decision results of the historical model are added to the training process of the new ensemble model to realize the incremental learning. Experiment results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing solutions in terms of detection accuracy, false alarm, stability and robustness.}

	abstract = {Cloud-based workflow architecture has been widely used in e-science, e-business, smart city, and others, to automate business processes and improve their flexibility and maintainability. Online workflow executes in a collaborative and distributed environment and is prone to fraud and information leakage. Workflow authorization models are implemented to ensure that tasks are performed by authorized subjects with compliance of security/privacy polices. However, existing workflow authorization models have some limitations. First, most of the existing research focuses on static workflows, where an order arriving at a workflow traverses tasks in a fixed sequence. In many real applications, however, task routing is not deterministic, having a probability distribution or pattern that may be estimated from historical data. Second, existing research ignores practical resource constraints, like user utilization, order waiting time, etc. To address the limitations, this article studies the workflow authorization model under the more realistic dynamic settings. We formulate a workflow as a queueing system, so business constraints can be analytically represented, under reasonable assumptions. We model the studied problems as pseudo-Boolean satisfiaiblity problems and investigate their theoretical properties. We also develop algorithms and carry out computational studies. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our developed solutions. Our research results are useful for production and process design in many real-life settings such as health care, online banking and electronic payment systems.}

Nevertheless, it is unclear how to support deduplication of encrypted data securely until the study of Bellare et al. on message-locked encryption (MLE, Eurocrypt 2013). While updating (shared) files is natural, existing MLE solutions do not allow efficient update of encrypted files stored remotely. Even modifying a single bit requires the expensive way of downloading and decrypting a large ciphertext (then re-uploading). This paper initiates the study of updatable block-level MLE, a new primitive in incremental cryptography and cloud cryptography. Our proposed provably-secure construction is updatable with computation cost logarithmic in the file size. It naturally supports block-level deduplication. It also supports proof-of-ownership which protects storage providers from being abused as a free content distribution network. Our experiments show its practical performance relative to the original MLE and existing non-updatable block-level MLE.}

	abstract = {Decision tree classification has become a prevailing technique for online diagnosis services. By outsourcing computation intensive tasks to a cloud server, cloud-assisted online diagnosis services are better ways for cases that the storage and computation requirements exceed the capability of medical institutions. With privacy concerns as well as intellectual property protection issues, the valuable diagnosis classifier and the sensitive user data should be protected against the cloud server. In this paper, we identify a work-flow for cloud-assisted online diagnosis services. We propose an efficient and secure decision tree classification scheme in the proposed work-flow. Specifically, the medical institution transforms a locally pre-trained decision tree classifier to a decision table, and later uses searchable symmetric encryption to encrypt the decision table. Then, the encrypted table is outsourced to the cloud server, and a user can submit encrypted physiological features to the cloud server and obtain an encrypted diagnosis prediction back. We provide formal security proofs to demonstrate that our scheme protects the confidentiality of the decision tree classifier and the user's data. The performance analysis shows that our scheme achieves faster-than-linear classification speed. Experimental evaluations show that our scheme requires several micro-seconds to process a diagnosis request in the tested datasets.}

One useful framework for fault-tolerant data processing in a distributed fashion is MapReduce, which was developed for trusted private clouds. This paper presents algorithms for data outsourcing based on Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and for executing privacy-preserving SQL queries such as count, selection including range selection, projection, and join while using MapReduce as an underlying programming model. Our proposed algorithms prevent an adversary from knowing the database or the query while also preventing output-size and access-pattern attacks. Interestingly, our algorithms do not involve the database owner, which only creates and distributes secret-shares once, in answering any query, and hence, the database owner also cannot learn the query. Logically and experimentally, we evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms on the following parameters: (i) the number of communication rounds (between a user and a server), (ii) the total amount of bit flow (between a user and a server), and (iii) the computational load at the user and the server.}

	abstract = {Searchable Encryption (SE) is an important technique to guarantee data security and usability in the cloud at the same time. Leveraging Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Keyword Search (CP-ABKS) scheme can achieve keyword-based retrieval and fine-grained access control simultaneously. However, the single attribute authority in existing CP-ABKS schemes is tasked with costly user certificate verification and secret key distribution. In addition, this results in a single-point performance bottleneck in distributed cloud systems. Thus, in this paper, we present a secure Multi-authority CP-ABKS (MABKS) system to address such limitations and minimize the computation and storage burden on resource-limited devices in cloud systems. In addition, the MABKS system is extended to support malicious attribute authority tracing and attribute update. Our rigorous security analysis shows that the MABKS system is selectively secure in both selective-matrix and selective-attribute models. Our experimental results using real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and utility of the MABKS system in practical applications.}

	abstract = {The Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, already deployed by the major avionics companies (e.g., QatarAirways and AmericanAirlines), will become mandatory on board of civil and military aircraft flying in Class A, B, and C airspaces by 2020, enabling direct airplanes communications and enhanced flights monitoring. However, ADS-B has been designed without security considerations, thus being vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including message injection and messages order manipulation attacks, that can be easily performed via widely available commercial Software Defined Radios. To address these threats, we present Securing Open Skies (SOS), a standard-compliant, backward-compatible, loss-tolerant, and bandwidth efficient security framework to secure ADS-B communications. SOS leverages the real deployment of densely distributed, participatory ADS-B sensor networks such as OpenSky Network and Flight Radar, and provides message authentication and integrity security services on a time-slot basis, without resorting to any public key cryptography mechanism. Experimental performances obtained through a realistic proof-of-concept, deployed using commercial Ettus Research X310 Software Defined Radios, demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our solution, even in presence of uniformly at random or burst packet loss events characterizing the ADS-B frequency band. For instance, SOS allows the verification of the authenticity of ADS-B messages requiring less than 50 percent of bandwidth overhead, with a percentage of verifiable slots above 80 percent, even in an highly lossy environment, characterized by a single packet loss probability of 60 percent-the process requiring less than one second: almost one tenth of similar approaches published in the literature. Finally, a thorough comparison against state of the art solutions in the literature highlights the unique security and reliability features enjoyed by SOS, as well as its practical viability.}

	abstract = {The simplicity of deployment and perpetual operation of energy harvesting devices provides a compelling proposition for a new class of edge devices for the Internet of Things. In particular, Computational Radio Frequency Identification (CRFID) devices are an emerging class of battery free, computational, sensing enhanced devices that harvest all of their energy for operation. Despite wireless connectivity and powering, secure wireless firmware updates remains an open challenge for CRFID devices due to: intermittent powering, limited computational capabilities, and the absence of a supervisory operating system. We present, for the first time , a secure wireless code dissemination (SecuCode) mechanism for CRFIDs by entangling a device intrinsic hardware security primitive —Static Random Access Memory Physical Unclonable Function (SRAM PUF)—to a firmware update protocol. The design of SecuCode: i) overcomes the resource-constrained and intermittently powered nature of the CRFID devices; ii) is fully compatible with existing communication protocols employed by CRFID devices—in particular, ISO-18000-6C protocol; and ii) is built upon a standard and industry compliant firmware compilation and update method realized by extending a recent framework for firmware updates provided by Texas Instruments. We build an end-to-end SecuCode implementation and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate standards compliance, evaluate performance and security.}

	abstract = {The ability to maintain functional and temporal correctness in the presence of faults is a key requirement in many safety-critical embedded systems. This work proposes an efficient fault recovery mechanism for real-time multiprocessor systems scheduled using a low overhead, semi-partitioned optimal proportional fair scheduling technique. We assume a system that can handle a single permanent processor fault at any time, using cold back-ups (with pre-specified activation / recovery time subsequent to the detection of a fault). As a result of the fault, the system may suffer transient overloads during such recovery periods, potentially leading to unacceptable fairness deviations and consequent rejections / early terminations of critical jobs. The proposed fault-tolerant scheduler, called Fault Tolerant Fair Scheduler (FT-FS), attempts to minimize such job terminations / rejections during recovery, by judiciously redistributing slacks accumulated by a subset of jobs, delivering more sustainable performance in the process. Experimental results reveal that the proposed FT-FS algorithm performs appreciably even under high system loads. Practical applicability of our proposed scheme has been illustrated using a case study on aircraft flight control system.}

	abstract = {Before Android 5.0, the services in Android applications can be invoked either explicitly or implicitly. However, since the implicit service invocations may suffer service hijacking attacks and thus lead to sensitive data leakage, they have been forbidden since Android 5.0. Thereafter the Android system will simply throw an exception and crash the applications that still invokes services implicitly, so that it was expected that application developers will be forced to convert the implicit service invocations to explicit ones. In this paper, we develop a static analysis framework called ISA to analyze the effectiveness of forbidden policy on removing the vulnerable service invocations. We collect two datasets containing common 1390 apps downloaded 1 to 3 months before the forbidden policy is enforced and 30 months after the forbidden policy is enforced, respectively. Our preliminary analysis indicates a 82.58% reduction in the number of vulnerable service invocations due to the enforcement of forbidden policy. However, upon further investigation, we discover that the forbidden policy fails to resolve service hijacking attacks. We find that 36 popular applications are still vulnerable to service hijacking attacks, which can lead to the leakage of sensitive information such as user login credential. Finally, we analyze the reasons of the residue vulnerable invocations and then propose two countermeasures.}

	abstract = {Today's smartphone app stores are full of apps with diverse features. Many developers use third-party libraries to reduce the development time and cost, but developers often ignore the security problems of third-party libraries. A major security problem introduced by third-party libraries is that a third-party library has the same permissions as the apps, called host-apps hereafter, that use it. According to previous research, having the same permissions as its host apps, a third-party library could have unauthorized access to user data, which poses a serious threat to app users. Therefore, how to prevent third-party libraries from abusing permissions has become an important issue. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Dynamic Permission Control mechanism, called Dynamic Permission Controller or DPC hereafter, for app developers to prohibit third-party libraries from abusing host apps' dangerous permissions. DPC modifies the permission control mechanism of Android framework to make apps have a more flexible permission management mechanism when they are running. DPC provides new APIs which allows an app to dynamically disable a granted dangerous permission before invoking an API of a third-party library and restore the dangerous permission after completing the API. Hence, DPC protects user's privacy by blocking unauthorized access from third-party libraries. Meanwhile, without the requirement that an app developer needs to know the detail of third-party libraries, the app still can use APIs of third-party libraries safely. Experimental results show that DPC works with many popular apps downloaded from Google Play well and DPC prohibits a third-party library from having the same dangerous permissions that its host apps have. Hence, unlike previous solutions, DPC does not have compatibility problems. The overhead introduced by DPC on an emulator and Nexus 7 are 1.8 and 0.3 percent respectively.}

	abstract = {Safe Browsing (SB) is an important security feature in modern web browsers to help detect new unsafe websites. Although useful, recent studies have pointed out that the widely adopted SB services, such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft SmartScreen, can raise privacy concerns since users' browsing history might be subject to unauthorized leakage to service providers. In this paper, we present a Privacy-Preserving Safe Browsing (PPSB) platform. It bridges the browser that uses the service and the third-party blacklist providers who provide unsafe URLs, with the guaranteed privacy of users and blacklist providers. Particularly, in PPSB, the actual URL to be checked, as well as its associated hashes or hash prefixes, never leave the browser in cleartext. This protects the user's browsing history from being directly leaked or indirectly inferred. Moreover, these lists of unsafe URLs, the most valuable asset for the blacklist providers, are always encrypted and kept private within our platform. Extensive evaluations using real datasets (with over 1 million unsafe URLs) demonstrate that our prototype can function as intended without sacrificing normal user experience, and block unsafe URLs at the millisecond level. All resources, including Chrome extension, Docker image, and source code, are available for public use.}

	abstract = {Among various bug reports (BRs), security bug reports (SBRs) are unique because they require immediate concealment and fixes. When SBRs are not identified in time, attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities. Prior work identifies SBRs via text mining, which requires a predefined keyword list and trains a classifier with known SBRs and non-security bug reports (NSBRs). The former approach is not reliable, because (1) as the contexts of security vulnerabilities and terminology of SBRs change over time, the predefined list will become out-dated; and (2) users may have insufficient SBRs for training. We introduce a semi-supervised learning-based approach, Sais, to adaptively and reliably identify SBRs. Given a project's BRs containing some labeled SBRs, many more NSBRs, and unlabeled BRs, Sais iteratively mines keywords, trains a classifier based on the keywords from the labeled data, classifies unlabeled BRs, and augments its training data with the newly labeled BRs. Our evaluation shows that Sais is useful for identifying SBRs.}

	abstract = {Bitcoin transactions are not truly anonymous as an attacker can attempt to reveal a user's private information by tracing related transactions. Existing approaches to protect privacy (e.g., mixcoin, shuffle, and blinded token) suffer from a number of limitations. For example, some approaches assume the existence of a trusted third party, rely on exchanges among various currencies, or broadcast sensitive details before mixing. Therefore, there is a real risk of privacy breach or losing tokens. Thus in this paper, we design a mixing scheme with one decentralized signature protocol, which does not rely on a third party or require a transaction fee. Specifically, our scheme uses a negotiation process to guarantee transaction details, which is monitored by the participants. Furthermore, the scheme includes a signature protocol based on the ElGamal signature protocol and secret sharing. The proposed scheme is then proven secure.}

	abstract = {Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Keyword Search (CP-ABKS) schemes support both fine-grained access control and keyword-based ciphertext retrieval, which make these schemes attractive for resource-constrained users (i.e., mobile or wearable devices, sensor nodes, etc.) to store, share and search encrypted data in the public cloud. However, ciphertext length and decryption overhead in the existing CP-ABKS schemes grow with the complexity of access policies or the number of data users' attributes. Moreover, such schemes generally do not consider the practical multi-owner setting (e.g., each file needs to be signed by multiple data owners before being uploaded to the cloud server) or prevent malicious cloud servers from returning incorrect search results. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we first design an optimized Verifiable Fine-grained Keyword Search scheme in the static Multi-owner setting (termed as basic VFKSM), which achieves short ciphertext length, fast ciphertext transformation, accelerated search process, and authentic search result verification. Then, we extend the basic VFKSM to support multi-keyword search and multi-owner update (also called as extended VFKSM). Finally, we prove that the basic (or extended) VFKSM resists the Chosen-Keyword Attack (CKA) and external Keyword-Guessing Attack (KGA). We also evaluate the performance of these schemes using various public datasets.}

	abstract = {Decision tree and its generalization of random forests are a simple yet powerful machine learning model for many classification and regression problems. Recent works propose how to privately evaluate a decision tree in a two-party setting where the feature vector of the client or the decision tree model (such as the threshold values of its nodes) is kept secret from another party. However, these works cannot be extended trivially to support the outsourcing setting where a third-party who should not have access to the model or the query. Furthermore, their use of an interactive comparison protocol does not support branching program, hence requires interactions with the client to determine the comparison result before resuming the evaluation task. In this paper, we propose the first secure protocol for collaborative evaluation of random forests contributed by multiple owners. They outsource evaluation tasks to a third-party evaluator. Upon receiving the client's encrypted inputs, the cloud evaluates obliviously on individually encrypted random forest models and calculates the aggregated result. The system is based on our new secure comparison protocol, secure counting protocol, and a multi-key somewhat homomorphic encryption on top of symmetric-key encryption. This allows us to reduce communication overheads while achieving round complexity lower than existing work.}

This personal information is evident in the application of e-ticketing where discounted access is granted to visitor attractions or transport services if users satisfy policies related to their age or disability or other defined over attributes. We propose a privacy-preserving electronic ticket scheme using attribute-based credentials to protect users' privacy. The benefit of our scheme is that the attributes of a user are certified by a trusted third party so that the scheme can provide assurances to a seller that a user's attributes are valid. The scheme makes the following contributions: (1) users can buy different tickets from ticket sellers without releasing their exact attributes; (2) two tickets of the same user cannot be linked; (3) a ticket cannot be transferred to another user; (4) a ticket cannot be double spent. The novelty of our scheme is to enable users to convince ticket sellers that their attributes satisfy the ticket policies and buy discounted tickets anonymously. This is a step towards identifying an e-ticketing scheme that captures user privacy requirements in transport services. The security of our scheme is proved and reduced to a well-known complexity assumption. The scheme is also implemented and its performance is empirically evaluated.}

	abstract = {Since Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) started entering the mainstream memory/storage market, we must consider how to secure NVM-equipped computing systems. Recent Meltdown and Spectre attacks are a strong evidence that security must be intrinsic to computing systems instead of being added as an afterthought. Processor vendors are taking the first steps and are beginning to build security primitives into commodity processors. One security primitive that is associated with the use of emerging NVMs is memory encryption. Memory encryption, while necessary, is very challenging when used with NVMs because it exacerbates the write endurance problem. Secure architectures use cryptographic metadata that must be persisted and restored to allow secure recovery of data in the event of power-loss. Specifically, encryption counters must be persistent to enable secure and functional recovery of an interrupted system. However, the cost of ensuring and maintaining persistence for these counters can be significant. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to maintain encryption counters without the need for frequent updates. Our new memory controller design, Osiris, repurposes memory Error-Correction Codes (ECCs) to enable fast restoration and recovery of encryption counters. Since different counter-mode encryption schemes are used in industry and research, we provide a versatile Osiris implementation that improves the performance and write-endurance in different memory encryption schemes. To evaluate our design, we use Gem5 to run eight memory-intensive workloads selected from SPEC2006 and U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) proxy applications, and three computation-intensive graph algorithms from CRONO. Compared to a write-through counter-cache scheme, on average, Osiris can reduce 45.8 percent of the memory writes (increase lifetime by 1.86x), and reduce the performance overhead from 44.7 percent(for write-through) to only 4.49 percent. Furthermore, without the need for backup battery or extra power-supply hold-up time, Osiris performs better than a battery-backed write-back (4.4 versus 5.7 percent overhead) and has less write-traffic (1.8 versus 5.4 percent overhead).}

	abstract = {Many systems require high security during a limited operational timeframe. These systems can be exposed to many attacks that prevent tasks from being completed. To reduce the chances of a successful attack and increase the security of these systems, many fault tolerance architectures and defense strategies have been developed. N-version architecture is one technique to improve reliability and security. In this architecture, functionally equivalent variants of a program are developed and executed concurrently. However, due to the high cost of developing and maintaining N versions, it is used for large budget projects. In this paper, an alternative approach to improve security is K-variant architecture. By applying safe and automated program transformations, functionally equivalent variants of the original program are generated. The goal is to shift vulnerabilities in variants into different locations. These variants are executed simultaneously to complete a task so that the chance of a successful exploitation attack is decreased. In this paper, several types of memory exploitation attacks are analyzed along with the proposed four defense strategies. The experimental study investigates the effectiveness of defense strategies against these attacks. The results suggest that K-variant architecture with the proposed defense strategies may significantly improve the security of systems.}

	abstract = {Negative survey is an effective method to protect the privacy of survey participants and has many applications. Different from normal survey, it hides personal privacy by requiring an individual participant to provide a negative option as the answer to the survey question. Answers of participants can further be reconstructed into the distribution of positive options. However, the current negative survey that assumes all participants are 100 percent confident in their answers introduces some precision loss to the reconstruction process. In this paper, we provide an accurate negative survey by allowing participants to annotate their confidence levels to the answers. In particular, we develop a novel Negative Survey to Positive Survey with Answer Confidence Level (NStoPS-CL) algorithm to reconstruct the negative survey with answer confidence level and further increase the accuracy of reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that NStoPS-CL reliably improves the reconstruction accuracy by testing answer confidence level under different conditions (i.e., dataset size, number of question options and dataset distributions), while balancing reconstruction accuracy and privacy well.}

	abstract = {Public blockchains have emerged as a promising direction in revolutionizing existing data-driven systems relying on centralized service providers. Among others, one kind of such systems is the popular crowdsensing systems which promise convenient data collection and aggregation. Although promising, leveraging public blockchains to build crowdsensing systems is non-trivial and has to overcome several barriers. First, public blockchains are transparent and lack support for data privacy. Second, participants from the open blockchain environment may misbehave in serving crowdsensing applications, like providing invalid data or doing aggregation incorrectly. Further, on-chain processing incurs monetary cost, so simply putting all workload on-chain is highly uneconomical and a delicate joint on-chain and off-chain design is required. In this paper, we take the first research attempt and explore a new design point to bridge public blockchains with crowdsensing systems. We propose a framework for building private, robust, and verifiable blockchain-empowered crowdsensing systems. It features an open service paradigm where blockchain nodes can rent out their computing resources to serve crowdsensing applications, with custom and full-fledged mechanisms to foster a healthy and economical ecosystem and to simultaneously tackle the challenges of data privacy, robustness against misbehaving participants, and service correctness assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate our designs practicality.}

However, centralized providers have a negative impact on the privacy of their users, since they are able to read and collect various data about their users and even link it to their identity via their payments. On the other hand, decentralized storage solutions like GNUnet suffer from a lack of participation by providers, since there is no feasible business model. We propose PriCloud, a decentralized storage system which allows users to pay their storage providers without sacrificing their privacy by employing anonymous storage smart contracts and private payments on a blockchain. We are able to provide privacy to the users and storage providers, and unlinkability between users and files. Our system offers decentralized file storage including strong privacy guarantees and built-in remuneration for storage providers.}

	abstract = {During the past decade, virtualization-based (e.g., virtual machine introspection) and hardware-assisted approaches (e.g., x86 SMM and ARM TrustZone) have been used to defend against low-level malware such as rootkits. However, these approaches either require a large Trusted Computing Base (TCB) or they must share CPU time with the operating system, disrupting normal execution. In this article, we propose an introspection framework called Nighthawk that transparently checks system integrity and monitor the runtime state of target system. Nighthawk leverages the Intel Management Engine (IME), a co-processor that runs in isolation from the main CPU. By using the IME, our approach has a minimal TCB and incurs negligible overhead on the host system on a suite of indicative benchmarks. We use Nighthawk to introspect the system software and firmware of a host system at runtime. The experimental results show that Nighthawk can detect real-world attacks against the OS, hypervisors, and System Management Mode while mitigating several classes of evasive attacks. Additionally, Nighthawk can monitor the runtime state of host system against the suspicious applications running in target machine.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has been broadly leveraged by major cloud providers, such as Google, AWS and Baidu, to offer various computer vision related services including image classification, object identification, illegal image detection, etc. While recent works extensively demonstrated that deep learning classification models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, cloud-based image detection models, which are more complicated than classifiers, may also have similar security concern but not get enough attention yet. In this paper, we mainly focus on the security issues of real-world cloud-based image detectors. Specifically, (1) based on effective semantic segmentation, we propose four attacks to generate semantics-aware adversarial examples via only interacting with black-box APIs; and (2) we make the first attempt to conduct an extensive empirical study of black-box attacks against real-world cloud-based image detectors. Through the comprehensive evaluations on five major cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Baidu Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud, we demonstrate that our image processing based attacks can reach a success rate of approximately 100 percent, and the semantic segmentation based attacks have a success rate over 90 percent among different detection services, such as violence, politician, and pornography detection. We also proposed several possible defense strategies for these security challenges in the real-life situation.}

	abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are commonly integrated with computing devices to enhance the performance and capabilities of graphical workloads. In addition, they are increasingly being integrated in data centers and clouds such that they can be used to accelerate data intensive workloads. Under a number of scenarios the GPU can be shared between multiple applications at a fine granularity allowing a spy application to monitor side channels and attempt to infer the behavior of the victim. For example, OpenGL and WebGL send workloads to the GPU at the granularity of a frame, allowing an attacker to interleave the use of the GPU to measure the side-effects of the victim computation through performance counters or other resource tracking APIs. We demonstrate the vulnerability by implementing three end-to-end attacks. We show that an OpenGL or CUDA based spy can fingerprint websites accurately (attack I), track user activities within the website, and even infer the keystroke timings for a password text box (attack II) with high accuracy. The third attack demonstrates how a CUDA spy application can derive the internal parameters of a neural network model being used by another CUDA application on the cloud. To counter these attacks, the paper suggests mitigations based on limiting the rate of the calls, or limiting the granularity of the returned information.}

In this study an Active Voice Period Detection algorithm is devised for PCM codec to detect whether a VoIP packet carries active or inactive voice data, and the data embedding location in a VoIP stream is chosen randomly according to random sequences generated from a logistic chaotic map. The initial parameters of the chaotic map and the selection of where to embed the message are negotiated between the communicating parties. Steganography experiments on active and inactive voice periods were carried out using a VoIP communications system. Performance evaluation and security analysis indicates that the proposed VoIP steganographic scheme can withstand statistical detection, and achieve secure real-time covert communications with high speech quality and negligible signal distortion.}

	abstract = {In the last decade, the dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as an architecture for high-performance computing workloads. Recently, researchers have also focused on the isolation property of a dedicated GPU and suggested GPU-based secure computing environments with several promising applications. However, despite the security analysis conducted by the prior studies, it has been unclear whether a dedicated GPU can be leveraged as a secure processor in the presence of a kernel-privileged attacker. In this paper, we first demonstrate the security of dedicated GPUs through comprehensive studies on context information for GPU execution. The paper shows that a kernel-privileged attacker can manipulate the GPU contexts to redirect memory accesses or execute arbitrary GPU codes on the running GPU kernel. Based on the security analysis, this paper proposes a new on-chip execution model for the dedicated GPU and a novel defense mechanism supporting the security of the on-chip execution. With comprehensive evaluation, the paper assures that the proposed solutions effectively isolate sensitive data in on-chip storages and defend against known attack vectors from a privileged attacker, supporting that the commodity GPUs can be leveraged as a secure processor.}

	abstract = {All the state-of-the-art rowhammer attacks can break the MMU-enforced inter-domain isolation because the physical memory owned by each domain is adjacent to each other. To mitigate these attacks, physical domain isolation, introduced by CATT, physically separates each domain by dividing the physical memory into multiple partitions and keeping each partition occupied by only one domain. CATT implemented physical kernel isolation as the first generic and practical software-only defense to protect kernel from being rowhammered as kernel is one of the most appealing targets. In this paper, we develop a novel exploit that could effectively defeat the CATT implementation and gain both root and kernel privileges, indicating that the physical kernel isolation is not secure in practice. Our exploit can work without exhausting the page cache or the system memory, or relying on the information of the virtual-to-physical address mapping. The exploit is motivated by our key observation that the modern OSes have double-owned kernel buffers (e.g., video buffers and SCSI Generic buffers) owned concurrently by the kernel and user domains. The existence of such buffers invalidates the physical separation enforced by CATT and makes the rowhammer-based attack possible again. Existing conspicuous rowhammer attacks achieving the root/kernel privilege escalation exhaust the page cache or even the whole system memory. Instead, we propose a new technique, named Memory Ambush. It is able to place the hammerable double-owned kernel buffers physically adjacent to the target objects (e.g., page tables) with only a small amount of memory. As a result, our exploit is stealthier and has fewer memory footprints. We also replace the inefficient rowhammer algorithm that blindly picks up addresses to hammer with an efficient one. Our algorithm selects suitable addresses based on an existing timing channel. We implement our exploit on the Linux kernel version 4.10.0. Our experiment results indicate that a successful attack could be done within 1 minute. The occupied memory is as low as 88 MB.}

	abstract = {Many enterprises and individuals prefer to outsource data to public cloud via various pricing approaches. One of the most widely-used approaches is the pay-as-you-go model, where the data owner hires public cloud to share data with data consumers, and only pays for the actually consumed services. To realize controllable and secure data sharing, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a suitable solution, which can provide fine-grained access control and encryption functionalities simultaneously. But there are some serious challenges when applying CP-ABE in pay-as-you-go. First, the decryption cost in ABE is too heavy for data consumers. Second, ABE ciphertexts probably suffer distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks, but there is no solution that can eliminate the security risk. At last, the data owner should audit resource consumption to guarantee the transparency of charge, while the existing method is inefficient. In this work, we propose a general construction named fully accountable ABE (FA-ABE), which simultaneously solves all the challenges by supporting all-sided accountability in the pay-as-you-go model. We formally define the security model and prove the security in the standard model. Also, we implement an instantiate construction with the self-developed library\nlibabe\n. The experiment results indicate the efficiency and practicality of our construction.}

	abstract = {Recently, deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple computer vision tasks, and become core parts of computer vision applications. In most of their implementations, a standard input preprocessing component called image scaling is embedded, in order to resize the original data to match the input size of pre-trained neural networks. This article demonstrates content disguising attacks by exploiting the image scaling procedure, which cause machine's extracted content to be dramatically dissimilar with that before scaled. Different from previous adversarial attacks, our attacks happen in the data preprocessing stage, and hence they are not subject to specific machine learning models. To achieve a better deceiving and disguising effect, we propose and implement three feasible attack approaches with L 0 - and L ∞ -norm distance metrics. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation on various image classification applications, including three local demos and two remote proprietary services. We also investigate the attack effects on a YOLO-v3 object detection demo. Our experimental results demonstrate successful content disguising against all of them, which validate our approaches are practical.}

	abstract = {Collaborative learning allows multiple clients to train a joint model without sharing their data with each other. Each client performs training locally and then submits the model updates to a central server for aggregation. Since the server has no visibility into the process of generating the updates, collaborative learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks where a malicious client can generate a poisoned update to introduce backdoor functionality to the joint model. The existing solutions for detecting poisoned updates, however, fail to defend against the recently proposed attacks, especially in the non-IID (independent and identically distributed) setting. In this article, we present a novel defense scheme to detect anomalous updates in both IID and non-IID settings. Our key idea is to realize client-side cross-validation, where each update is evaluated over other clients' local data. The server will adjust the weights of the updates based on the evaluation results when performing aggregation. To adapt to the unbalanced distribution of data in the non-IID setting, a dynamic client allocation mechanism is designed to assign detection tasks to the most suitable clients. During the detection process, we also protect the client-level privacy to prevent malicious clients from knowing the participations of other clients, by integrating differential privacy with our design without degrading the detection performance. Our experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets show that our scheme is significantly robust to two representative poisoning attacks.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting attacks use statistical analysis on network traffic to compromise user privacy. The classical attack model used to evaluate website fingerprinting attacks assumes an on-path adversary, who observes traffic traveling between the user's computer and the network. In this article we investigate a different attack model, in which the adversary sends JavaScript code to the target user's computer. This code mounts a cache side-channel attack to identify other websites being browsed. Using machine learning techniques to classify traces of cache activity, we achieve high classification accuracy in both the open-world and the closed-world models. Our attack is more resistant than network-based fingerprinting to the effects of response caching, and resilient both to network-based defenses and to side-channel countermeasures. We carry out a real-world evaluation of several aspects of our attack, exploring the impact of the changes in websites and browsers over time, as well as of the attacker's ability to guess the software and hardware configuration of the target user's computer. To protect against cache-based website fingerprinting, new defense mechanisms must be introduced to privacy-sensitive browsers and websites. We investigate one such mechanism, and show that it reduces the effectiveness of the attack and completely eliminates it when used in the Tor Browser.}

	abstract = {Transparency has become a critical need in machine learning (ML) applications. Designing transparent ML models helps increase trust, ensure accountability, and scrutinize fairness. Some organizations may opt-out of transparency to protect individuals’ privacy. Therefore, there is a great demand for transparency models that consider both privacy and security risks. Such transparency models can motivate organizations to improve their credibility by making the ML-based decision-making process comprehensible to end-users. Differential privacy (DP) provides an important technique to disclose information while protecting individual privacy. However, it has been shown that DP alone cannot prevent certain types of privacy attacks against disclosed ML models. DP with low\nϵ\nvalues can provide high privacy guarantees, but may result in significantly weaker ML models in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, setting\nϵ\nvalue too high may lead to successful privacy attacks. This raises the question whether we can disclose accurate transparent ML models while preserving privacy. In this article we introduce a novel technique that complements DP to ensure model transparency and accuracy while being robust against model inversion attacks. We show that combining the proposed technique with DP provide highly transparent and accurate ML models while preserving privacy against model inversion attacks.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where hidden features (patterns) trained to a normal model, which is only activated by some specific input (called triggers), trick the model into producing unexpected behavior. In this article, we create covert and scattered triggers for backdoor attacks, invisible backdoors, where triggers can fool both DNN models and human inspection. We apply our invisible backdoors through two state-of-the-art methods of embedding triggers for backdoor attacks. The first approach on Badnets embeds the trigger into DNNs through steganography. The second approach of a trojan attack uses two types of additional regularization terms to generate the triggers with irregular shape and size. We use the Attack Success Rate and Functionality to measure the performance of our attacks. We introduce two novel definitions of invisibility for human perception; one is conceptualized by the Perceptual Adversarial Similarity Score (PASS) and the other is Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). We show that the proposed invisible backdoors can be fairly effective across various DNN models as well as four datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB, by measuring their attack success rates for the adversary, functionality for the normal users, and invisibility scores for the administrators. We finally argue that the proposed invisible backdoor attacks can effectively thwart the state-of-the-art trojan backdoor detection approaches.}

	abstract = {Deep learning algorithms provide state-of-the-art results on a multitude of applications. However, it is also well established that they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. It is often believed that the solution to this vulnerability of deep learning systems must come from deep networks only. Contrary to this common understanding, in this article, we propose a non-deep learning approach that searches over a set of well-known image transforms such as Discrete Wavelet Transform and Discrete Sine Transform, and classifying the features with a support vector machine-based classifier. Existing deep networks-based defense have been proven ineffective against sophisticated adversaries, whereas image transformation-based solution makes a strong defense because of the non-differential nature, multiscale, and orientation filtering. The proposed approach, which combines the outputs of two transforms, efficiently generalizes across databases as well as different unseen attacks and combinations of both (i.e., cross-database and unseen noise generation CNN model). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on large scale databases, including object database (validation set of ImageNet) and face recognition (MBGC) database. The proposed detection algorithm yields at-least 84.2% and 80.1% detection accuracy under seen and unseen database test settings, respectively. Besides, we also show how the impact of the adversarial perturbation can be neutralized using a wavelet decomposition-based filtering method of denoising. The mitigation results with different perturbation methods on several image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of internet finance has caused increasing concern in online payment fraud due to its great threat. It is typical to employ rule systems or machine learning-based techniques to detect frauds. For the most significant features of such fraudulent transactions are exhibited in a sequential form, the sliding time window is a widely-recognized effective tool for this problem. With a sliding time window, features about the transaction characteristics can be extracted, and the latent patterns hidden in transaction records can be captured. However, the adaptive setting of sliding time window is really a big challenge, since the transaction patterns in real-life application scenarios are often too elusive to be captured. As a matter of fact, the practical setting usually needs to be updated and refined with manual intervention regularly. This is time-consuming indeed. In this article, we pursue an adaptive learning approach to detect fraudulent online payment transactions with automatic sliding time windows. Accordingly, we make efforts on optimizing the setting of windows and improving the adaptability. We design an intelligent window, called learning automatic window ( LAW ). It utilizes the learning automata to learn the proper parameters of time windows and adjust them dynamically and regularly according to the variation and oscillation of fraudulent transaction patterns. By the experiments over a real-world dataset of the online payment service from a commercial bank, we validate the gain of LAW in terms of detection effectiveness and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make a sliding time window for fraud detection capable of learning its proper size in changing situations.}

We can apply such an analysis to detect negative sentiment, which represents the anomalous activities in operating system (OS) logs. Existing methods involve manual searching, predefined rules, or traditional machine learning techniques to detect such suspicious events. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based sentiment analysis technique to check whether there are anomalous activities in OS logs. Log messages are modeled as sentences and we identify the sentiments using the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. OS log datasets inherently have a class imbalance in the sense that the number of negative sentiment is much lower than that of the number of positive ones. In order to address the class imbalance, we build a GRU layer on top of a class imbalance solver using the Tomek link method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect anomalous events in OS logs with an overall F1 and accuracy of 99.84 and 99.93 percent, respectively.}

	abstract = {With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSNs), the security and privacy of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the public. Among threats OSNs face, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental. They are often employed to violate users’ privacy, distribute spam, and disturb the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot detection solutions. Unlike traditional social bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this article proposes a method called BotFlowMon that relies only on content-agnostic flow-level data as input to identify OSN bot traffic. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to classify social bot traffic from real OSN user traffic, including aggregating network flow records to obtain OSN transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, and an innovative density-valley-based clustering algorithm to subdivide each transaction into individual actions. The evaluation shows BotFlowMon can identify the traffic from social bots with a 96.1 percent accuracy, which, based on the worst case study on a testing machine, only takes no more than 0.71 seconds on average after it sees the traffic.}

Specifically, due to their existing vulnerabilities IoT devices are susceptible to being compromised and being part of a new type of stealthy Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, called Mongolian DDoS, which is characterized by its widely distributed nature and small attack size from each source. This article proposes a novel anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is capable of timely detecting and mitigating this emerging type of DDoS attacks.

	abstract = {Classification algorithms have been widely adopted to detect anomalies for various systems, e.g., IoT, cloud and face recognition, under the common assumption that the data source is clean, i.e., features and labels are correctly set. However, data collected from the wild can be unreliable due to careless annotations or malicious data transformation for incorrect anomaly detection. In this article, we extend a two-layer on-line data selection framework: Robust Anomaly Detector (RAD) with a newly designed ensemble prediction where both layers contribute to the final anomaly detection decision. To adapt to the on-line nature of anomaly detection, we consider additional features of conflicting opinions of classifiers, repetitive cleaning, and oracle knowledge. We on-line learn from incoming data streams and continuously cleanse the data, so as to adapt to the increasing learning capacity from the larger accumulated data set. Moreover, we explore the concept of oracle learning that provides additional information of true labels for difficult data points. We specifically focus on three use cases, (i) detecting 10 classes of IoT attacks, (ii) predicting 4 classes of task failures of big data jobs, and (iii) recognising 100 celebrities faces. Our evaluation results show that RAD can robustly improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, to reach up to 98.95 percent for IoT device attacks (i.e., +7%), up to 85.03 percent for cloud task failures (i.e., +14%) under 40 percent label noise, and for its extension, it can reach up to 77.51 percent for face recognition (i.e., +39%) under 30 percent label noise. The proposed RAD and its extensions are general and can be applied to different anomaly detection algorithms.}

While bringing convenience to hundreds of millions of users, dating apps are vulnerable to become targets of adversaries. In this article, we focus on malicious user detection in dating apps. Existing methods overlooked the signals hidden in the textual information of user interactions, particularly the interplay of temporal-spatial behaviors and textual information, leading to limited detection performance. To tackle this, we propose DatingSec, a novel malicious user detection system for dating apps. Concretely, DatingSec leverages long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) and an attentive module to capture the interplay of users' temporal-spatial behaviors and user-generated textual content. We evaluate DatingSec on a real-world dataset collected from Momo, a widely used dating app with more than 180 million users. Experimental results show that DatingSec outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves an F1-score of 0.857 and AUC of 0.940.}

	abstract = {Fine-grained software vulnerability detection is an important and challenging problem. Ideally, a detection system (or detector) not only should be able to detect whether or not a program contains vulnerabilities, but also should be able to pinpoint the type of a vulnerability in question. Existing vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning can detect the presence of vulnerabilities (i.e., addressing the binary classification or detection problem), but cannot pinpoint types of vulnerabilities (i.e., incapable of addressing multiclass classification). In this paper, we propose the first deep learning-based system for multiclass vulnerability detection, dubbed μ VulDeePecker. The key insight underlying μ VulDeePecker is the concept of code attention, which can capture information that can help pinpoint types of vulnerabilities, even when the samples are small. For this purpose, we create a dataset from scratch and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of μ VulDeePecker. Experimental results show that μ VulDeePecker is effective for multiclass vulnerability detection and that accommodating control-dependence (other than data-dependence) can lead to higher detection capabilities.}

	abstract = {Heap randomization, in general, has been a well-trodden area; however, the efficacy of byte-granularity randomization has never been fully explored as misalignment raises various concerns. Modern heap exploits often abuse the determinism in word alignment, and modern CPU architecture better supports unaligned access (since Nehalem). Based on such new developments, we conduct an in-depth analysis of evaluating the efficacy of byte-granularity heap randomization in three folds: (i) security effectiveness, (ii) performance impact, and (iii) compatibility analysis to measure deployment cost. Security discussion is based on 20 CVE case studies. To measure performance details, we conduct cycle-level microbenchmarks and report that the performance cost is highly concentrated to edge cases depending on the L1-cache line. Based on such analysis, we design and implement an allocator suited for byte-granularity heap randomization. On the negative side, our analysis suggests that byte-granularity heap randomization has high deployment cost due to various implementation conflicts. We enumerate the problematic compatibility issues using Coreutils, Nginx, and ChakraCore benchmarks.}

Unfortunately, it has brought a series of security and privacy issues. Most of the state-of-the-art either disclosed text/pattern privacy or exploited the computationally-intensive techniques of public key fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), commitment schemes and zero knowledge proof to achieve both text/pattern privacy and verifiability. To address these issues, as a building block, an efficient privacy preserving verifiable outsourced discrete fourier transform protocol OVFT is first devised based on any one-way trapdoor permutation (OWTP). Based on OVFT, we propose an efficient secure verifiable outsourced polynomial multiplication protocol OPVML which is further exploited in designing our final protocol PVOPM for verifiable privacy-preserving outsourced pattern matching. Without exploiting public key FHE, the proposed PVOPM achieves both verifiability and text/pattern privacy against the collusion between the cloud and malicious receiver/sender, by generating authentication proofs of constant size and executing constant times of any one-way trapdoor permutation, independent to both the text size\nn\nand the pattern size\nm\n. Finally, formal security proof under universal composable (UC) model and extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and practicability of our proposed PVOPM.}

To face this challenge, this work proposes a novel strategy for defeating the anonymity of traffic flows, collected within and at the exit of these anonymizing networks, relying on distributed flow-capture, characterization and correlation attacks driven by wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis. Such a strategy, starting from a properly formalized attack model, results in an effective and promising framework that can be easily deployed on real-life network equipment and can potentially scale by working according to different distribution/parallelization scenarios.}

	abstract = {The full-buffer Shrew (FB-Shrew) denial of service (DoS) attack is a variant of the classic Shrew attack that exploits the congestion control mechanism of transmission control protocol (TCP). Here, an attacker sends a high-rate burst of attack packets only after the router buffer is filled with TCP packets, causing the router to drop legitimate packets, and forcing the retransmission of TCP packets. As such, an FB-Shrew attack can cause maximum damage with minimum resources. In this paper, we challenge an assumption of constant round trip time adopted in the original FB-Shrew model. As a result, this model fails to achieve its expected attack effect. In response, we analyze the TCP congestion window and queue behaviors to develop two low-high burst models for maximizing the potency of the FB-Shrew attack. Model 1 is designed to achieve the attack effect expected of the original model. Then, the attack potency of Model 1 is enhanced by simply adjusting the starting time of the attack burst to form Model 2. Mode 1 only exploits the retransmission timeout (RTO) mechanism. Model 2 takes advantage of both the RTO mechanism and the fast retransmission mechanism. In this way, Model 2 further slows down the growth of the congestion window and extends the attack period. A combination of theoretical analyses and simulations are adopted to first validate the proper functioning and effectiveness of the two models for a standard network configuration, and then we assess their attack performances with variations in different network parameters. Our performance assessment demonstrates that one attack unit of Model 2 damages almost twice the number of TCP units as one attack unit of Model 1, which represents an increase in attack potency of nearly 200 percent. The present study provides an expanded basis to explore FB-Shrew attack patterns that may be utilized by attackers. Moreover, the damage that could be inflicted by such attack and the extent to which defense strategies are capable of mitigating the attack's impact could be assessed more precisely by defenders.}

	abstract = {Personal e-health records (EHR) enable medical workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) to conveniently and quickly access each patient's medical history through the public cloud, which greatly facilitates patients' visits and makes telemedicine possible. Additionally, since EHR involve patients' personal privacy information, EHR holders would hesitate to directly outsource their data to cloud servers. A natural and favorite manner of conquering this issue is to encrypt these outsourced EHR such that only authorized medical workers can access them. Specifically, the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) supports fine-grained access over encrypted data and is considered to be a perfect solution of securely sharing EHR in the public cloud. In this paper, to strengthen the system security and meet the requirement of specific applications, we add functionalities of user revocation, secret key delegation and ciphertext update to the original ABE, and propose a revocable-storage hierarchical attribute-based encryption (RS-HABE) scheme, as the core building of establishing a framework for secure sharing of EHR in public cloud. The proposed RS-HABE scheme features of forward security (a revoked user can no longer access previously encrypted data) and backward security (a revoked user also cannot access subsequently encrypted data) simultaneously, and is proved to be selectively secure under a complexity assumption in bilinear groups, without random oracles. The theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed scheme surpasses existing similar works in terms of functionality and security, at the acceptable cost of computation overhead. Moreover, we implement the proposed scheme and present experiments to demonstrate its practicability.}

The objective of this article is to address the challenges of modeling and detecting sophisticated network attacks, such as multiple interleaved attacks. We present the interleaving concept and investigate how interleaving multiple attacks can deceive intrusion detection systems. Using one of the important statistical machine learning (ML) techniques, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), we develop two architectures that take into account the stealth nature of the interleaving attacks, and that can detect and track the progress of these attacks. These architectures deploy a database of HMM templates of known attacks and exhibit varying performance and complexity. For performance evaluation, in the presence of multiple multi-stage attack scenarios, various metrics are proposed which include (1) attack risk probability, (2) detection error rate, and (3) the number of correctly detected stages. Extensive simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures.}

	abstract = {Anonymous Communication (AC) hides traffic patterns and protects message metadata from being leaked during message transmission. Many practical AC systems have been proposed aiming to reduce communication latency and support a large number of users. However, how to design AC systems which possess strong security property and at the same time achieve optimal performance (i.e., the lowest latency or highest horizontal scalability) has been a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an ObliComm framework, which consists of six modular AC subroutines. We also present a strong security definition for AC, named oblivious communication, encompassing confidentiality, unobservability, and a new requirement sending-and-receiving operation hiding. The AC subroutines in ObliComm allow for modular construction of oblivious communication systems in different network topologies. All constructed systems satisfy oblivious communication definition and can be provably secure in the universal composability (UC) framework. Additionally, we model the relationship between the network topology and communication measurements by queuing theory, which enables the system's efficiency can be optimized and estimated by quantitative analysis and calculation. Through theoretical analyses and empirical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme and soundness of the queuing model.}

	abstract = {Access control deals with the roles and privileges to which a user is authorized, and is an important aspect of the security of a system. As enterprise access control systems need to scale to several users, roles and privileges, it is common for access control models to support delegation: a trusted security administrator is able to give semi-trusted users the ability to change portions of the authorization state. With delegation comes the danger that semi-trusted users, perhaps in collusion, may effect a state that violates enterprise policy, which in turn results in the problem called safety analysis, which is regarded as a fundamental and technically challenging problem in access control. Safety analysis is used by a trusted security administrator to answer “what if” questions before she grants privileges to a semi-trusted user. Safety analysis has been studied for various access control schemes in the literature; we address safety analysis in the context of Administrative Temporal Role-Based Access Control (ATRBAC), an administrative model for TRBAC, which is an extension to the traditional RBAC. ATRBAC has new features, which introduce new technical challenges for safety analysis: (i) a time-dimension: two new components in each administrative rule that specify in which time periods an administrative action may be effected, and a user is authorized to a role, and, (ii) two new kinds of rules for whether a role is enabled for administrative action. We propose a software tool, which we call Cree, for safety analysis of ATRBAC policies. In Cree we reduce ATRBAC-Safety to model checking and use an off-the-shelf model checker, NuSMV. The foundation for Cree is the observation from our prior work that ATRBAC safety is PSPACE. Along with an efficient reduction to model checking, we include in Cree four techniques to further improve performance: Polynomial Time Solving when possible, Forward and Backwards Pruning, Abstraction Refinement, and Bound Estimation. These are inspired by prior work, but our algorithms are different in that they address the new challenges that ATRBAC introduces. We discuss our design of Cree, and the results of a thorough empirical assessment across our approach, and five other prior tools for ATRBAC safety. Our results suggest that there are input classes for which Cree outperforms existing tools, and for the remainder, Cree's performance is no worse. We have made Cree available as open-source for public download.}

	abstract = {Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is popularly used in practice for privacy-preserving data collection. Although existing LDP protocols offer high utility for large user populations (100,000 or more users), they perform poorly in scenarios with small user populations (such as those in the cybersecurity domain) and lack perturbation mechanisms that are effective for both ordinal and non-ordinal item sequences while protecting sequence length and content simultaneously. In this paper, we address the small user population problem by introducing the concept of Condensed Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) as a specialization of LDP, and develop a suite of CLDP protocols that offer desirable statistical utility while preserving privacy. Our protocols support different types of client data, ranging from ordinal data types in finite metric spaces (numeric malware infection statistics), to non-ordinal items (OS versions, transaction categories), and to sequences of ordinal and non-ordinal items. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, including datasets that are an order of magnitude smaller than those used in existing approaches, which show that proposed CLDP protocols yield high utility. Furthermore, case studies with Symantec datasets demonstrate that our protocols accurately support key cybersecurity-focused tasks of detecting ransomware outbreaks, identifying targeted and vulnerable OSs, and inspecting suspicious activities on infected machines.}

All the existing PDP schemes make use of RSA or bilinear pairings. One large file has to be divided into a great many of blocks. For example, 1T (Terabit) file has to be divided into 1.0737 \\times 10^9\nblocks (RSA where the length of the index is 1024 bits) or 6.8719 \\times 10^9\nblocks (bilinear pairings where the order of the elliptic curve is 160 bits). The huge computation cost and communication cost incurs the inefficient PDP implementation. In other words, they are not practical. In order to solve the problem, we propose a new PDP model: blockchain-based private PDP. The new concept makes use of blockchain which is the core of cryptocurrency. For the new concept, the paper formalizes its system model and security model. Then, a concrete blockchain-based private PDP scheme is designed by making use of blockchain and RSA. The proposed blockchain-based private PDP scheme is provably secure. At the same time, we also analyze its performance from two parts: theory analysis and implementation prototype. Our analysis shows that the proposed PDP scheme is secure, efficient and practical.}

In this article, we report the first systematic study on iOS Chameleon apps, which sheds light on a largely overlooked threat that the illicit activities are launched solely based on UI. Our research employed Chameleon-Hunter, a new static analysis approach that determines the suspiciousness of a PHI-UI leveraging the semantic features generated from iOS app UI and metadata. The approach is based on the observation that PHI-UI not only is structurally hidden but also has notable semantic inconsistency with the benign UI. Our evaluation shows that Chameleon-Hunter is highly effective, achieving 92.6 percent precision and 94.7 percent recall. From 28K Apple App Store apps, we found 142 new Chameleon apps, which were confirmed and promptly removed by Apple. Our work reveals that Chameleon apps can easily bypass the App store vetting and conduct a set of suspicious activities including collecting users' private information, swindling money with fake monetary services, and leading the user to a pirated app store.}

Although various techniques have been developed to identify whether a device is close, the problem of identifying the far proximity (i.e., a target is at least a certain distance away) has been neglected by the research community. Meanwhile, verifying the far proximity is desirable and critical to enhance the security of emerging wireless applications.

The key idea of the proposed approach is to estimate the far proximity from the unforgeable “fingerprint” of the proximity. We have validated and evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed far proximity identification method through experiments on real measured channel data. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can detect the far proximity with a successful rate of 0.85 for the non-Line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario, and the successful rate can be further increased to 0.99 for the Line-of-sight (LoS) scenario.}

	abstract = {We propose a multi-client Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) scheme based on the single-user protocol [3] . The scheme allows any user to generate a search query by interacting with any θ is a threshold parameter) `helping' users. It preserves the privacy of a database content against the server assuming a leakage of up to θ-1 users' keys to the server while hiding the query from the θ-1 `helping users'. To achieve the query privacy, we design a new distributed key-homomorphic pseudorandom function (PRF) that hides the PRF input (search keyword) from the `helping' users. We present a concrete construction of our randomizable distributed PRF. By distributing the utilized keys among the users, the need for a constant online presence of the data owner to provide services to the users is eliminated, while providing resilience against a user key exposure. We extended our scheme to support user revocation in two different scenarios. In addition, we give a solution for fast update of the encryption key with the overhead significantly smaller than the re-encryption and re-uploading the database. Moreover, our scheme is secure against passive and active collusion between the server and a subset of users.}

	abstract = {Deep learning can achieve higher accuracy than traditional machine learning algorithms in a variety of machine learning tasks. Recently, privacy-preserving deep learning has drawn tremendous attention from information security community, in which neither training data nor the training model is expected to be exposed. Federated learning is a popular learning mechanism, where multiple parties upload local gradients to a server and the server updates model parameters with the collected gradients. However, there are many security problems neglected in federated learning, for example, the participants may behave incorrectly in gradient collecting or parameter updating, and the server may be malicious as well. In this article, we present a distributed, secure, and fair deep learning framework named DeepChain to solve these problems. DeepChain provides a value-driven incentive mechanism based on Blockchain to force the participants to behave correctly. Meanwhile, DeepChain guarantees data privacy for each participant and provides auditability for the whole training process. We implement a prototype of DeepChain and conduct experiments on a real dataset for different settings, and the results show that our DeepChain is promising.}

	abstract = {When moving large and heterogeneous data collections to the cloud, a key requirement concerns the selection of the most suitable (set of) cloud service(s) for outsourcing. Not only can different resources have different characteristics and requirements, but different cloud providers can also offer different services and security guarantees, and can have different costs. Selecting a single service for outsourcing an entire data collection can result in a non-optimal solution, as a single service satisfying, at reasonable costs, all the requirements specified by the data owner might not exist. Selecting a set of services could instead ensure the satisfaction of the requirements, possibly with economic advantages. In this article, we address this problem and present a flexible and expressive, yet simple model for supporting data owners in identifying a proper allocation of their resources to a set of cloud services. Our model allows data owners to specify in an easy and intuitive way protection requirements operating at the granularity level of single resource (or class thereof), and representing the minimum security guarantees that a cloud service must offer to store resources. Resources can be outsourced in plaintext or encrypted form, depending on their requirements and on what is the most convenient allocation. Data owners can then also specify global allocation requirements that apply to the overall allocation, to reduce the burden on their side and to avoid excessive fragmentation of the resource collection. We solve the problem of finding an allocation that satisfies both the protection and the global allocation requirements, while minimizing economic costs, by formulating it as a binary programming problem, thus allowing the use of existing techniques for its efficient solution.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has great potential in automated code vulnerability discovery. However, automated discovery application driven by off-the-shelf machine learning tools often performs poorly due to the shortage of high-quality training data. The scarceness of vulnerability data is almost always a problem for any developing software project during its early stages, which is referred to as the cold-start problem. This article proposes a framework that utilizes transferable knowledge from pre-existing data sources. In order to improve the detection performance, multiple vulnerability-relevant data sources were selected to form a broader base for learning transferable knowledge. The selected vulnerability-relevant data sources are cross-domain, including historical vulnerability data from different software projects and data from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) consisting of synthetic vulnerability examples and proof-of-concept test cases. To extract the information applicable in vulnerability detection from the cross-domain data sets, we designed a deep-learning-based framework with Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. Our framework combines the heterogeneous data sources to learn unified representations of the patterns of the vulnerable source codes. Empirical studies showed that the unified representations generated by the proposed deep learning networks are feasible and effective, and are transferable for real-world vulnerability detection. Our experiments demonstrated that by leveraging two heterogeneous data sources, the performance of our vulnerability detection outperformed the static vulnerability discovery tool Flawfinder . The findings of this article may stimulate further research in ML-based vulnerability detection using heterogeneous data sources.}

	abstract = {Security auditing allows cloud tenants to verify the compliance of cloud infrastructure with respect to desirable security properties, e.g., whether a tenant's virtual network is properly isolated from other tenants' networks. However, the input to the auditing task, such as the detailed topology of the underlying cloud infrastructure, typically contains sensitive information which a cloud provider may be reluctant to hand over to a third party auditor. Additionally, auditing results intended for one tenant may inadvertently reveal private information about other tenants, e.g., another tenant's VM is reachable due to a misconfiguration. How to anonymize both the input data and the auditing results in order to prevent such information leakage is a novel challenge that has received little attention. Directly applying most of the existing anonymization techniques to such a context would either lead to insufficient protection or render the data unsuitable for auditing. In this article, we propose SegGuard, a novel anonymization approach that prevents cross-tenant information leakage through per-tenant encryption, and prevents information leakage to auditors through hiding real input segments among fake ones; in addition, applying property-preserving encryption in an innovative way enables SegGuard to preserve the data utility for auditing while mitigating semantic attacks. We implement SegGuard based on OpenStack, and evaluate its effectiveness and overhead using both synthetic and real data. Our experimental results demonstrate that SegGuard can reduce the information leakage to a negligible level (e.g., less than 1 percent for an adversary with 50 percent pre-knowledge) with a practical response time (e.g., 62 seconds to anonymize a cloud infrastructure with 25,000 virtual machines).}

	abstract = {Anonymization for privacy-preserving data publishing, also known as statistical disclosure control (SDC), can be viewed under the lens of the permutation model. According to this model, any SDC method for individual data records is functionally equivalent to a permutation step plus a noise addition step, where the noise added is marginal, in the sense that it does not alter ranks. Here, we propose metrics to quantify the data confidentiality and utility achieved by SDC methods based on the permutation model. We distinguish two privacy notions: in our work, anonymity refers to subjects and hence mainly to protection against record re-identification, whereas confidentiality refers to the protection afforded to attribute values against attribute disclosure. Thus, our confidentiality metrics are useful even if using a privacy model ensuring an anonymity level ex ante. The utility metric is a general-purpose metric that can be conveniently traded off against the confidentiality metrics, because all of them are bounded between 0 and 1. As an application, we compare the utility-confidentiality trade-offs achieved by several anonymization approaches, including privacy models (k-anonymity and ε-differential privacy) as well as SDC methods (additive noise, multiplicative noise and synthetic data) used without privacy models.}

Although the authors claimed that the offline keyword guessing attacks can be resisted in ABKS-SM scheme, we show that this scheme indeed suffers from four types of offline keyword guessing attacks and hence fails to gain the claimed security property, which is an important goal to be achieved in searchable encryption schemes. Specifically, given the concrete attacks, we demonstrate that the underlying keyword information can be extracted from both encrypted keyword indexes and trapdoors by any malicious user and any adversarial CSP. We hope that the similar security vulnerabilities could be avoided in the future design of related searchable encryption schemes.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial examples. In the past few years, many efforts have been spent on exploring query-optimisation attacks to find adversarial examples of either black-box or white-box DNN models, as well as the defending countermeasures against those attacks. In this article, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models under the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which have not been investigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the aforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such attacks must acquire the outputs from the models multiple times before actually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in practice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised onto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In contrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can mitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively studied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to either transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode outputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples. The proposed method can endue more capability to MitM attackers. Based on our evaluation, the proposed attack can achieve above 95 percent success rates on both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, which is better or comparable with state-of-the-art query-optimisation attacks. In the meantime, the attack is 10 4 times faster than the query-optimisation attacks.}

	abstract = {With the evolution of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), there has been an overwhelming increase in the number of connected vehicles in recent times. Due to this reason, massive amounts of data generated by connected vehicles makes traditional host-centric approach inevitable in IoV ecosystem. Moreover, the existing TCP/IP based congestion control mechanisms cannot be directly applied in IoV environment as there is a requirement of content sharing among vehicles with reduced delay and high throughput. So, in this article, 1 1.\nThis article is an extended version of paper entitled “Deep Learning-based Content Centric Data Dissemination Scheme for Internet of Vehicles“ published in IEEE ICC, 20-24 May 2018, Kansas City, USA\nDiLSe: A Lattice-based Secure and Dependable Data Dissemination Scheme for Social Internet of Vehicles is designed, which works in three modules. The first module, i.e., deep learning based content centric data dissemination scheme, works in three phases. 1) In the first phase, the connection probability of vehicles is computed to identify stable and reliable connections using Weiner process model. 2) In the second phase, a convolutional neural network based scheme is presented for estimating the social relationship score among vehicle-to-vehicle pair. 3) In the third phase, a content centric data dissemination scheme is presented. However, the mobility of vehicles in IoV ecosystem gives them the liberty to move in/out of the network without IP assignment. This makes it necessary to replicate the content at each node for providing fault tolerance. So, in the second module, a data replication scheme for fault tolerance in IoV network is designed, which is followed by an access control mechanism for read/right access for network content in third module. Finally, in the last module, a crucial lattice-based exchange and authentication scheme using blockchain is also designed for handling secure communication in IoV ecosystem. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a highway topology using extensive simulations. The results obtained prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme concerning various performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Protecting sensitive data from theft, exfiltration, and other kinds of abuses by malicious insiders is a challenging problem. While access control mechanisms cannot always prevent the insiders from misusing sensitive data (since, in most of the cases, authorized users within organizations are granted access permissions), malicious outsiders also pose severe threats due to different security vulnerabilities in the systems, e.g., phishing attacks, memory corruptions, etc., which enable them to steal the credentials of the authorized users who have access to the data. To protect sensitive data from such attackers, anomaly detection techniques are often combined with other existing security measures, e.g., access control and encryption. An anomaly detection technique for identifying anomalies in file system accesses is based on the key idea that there should be significant differences between the file access behaviors of a benign user and an attacker. In this article, we propose an approach to create fine-grained profiles of the users’ regular file access activities while extensively analyzing the timestamp information of the file accesses. According to our observation, even if a user’s access to a file seems benign, only a fine-grained analysis of the access (such as the size of access, the timestamp of access) can determine the original intention of the user. We exploit the users’ file access information at the block level to model their regular file access behaviors (user profiles) which are then securely stored and used for identifying anomalous file system accesses in the detection phase. We are also able to automatically profile new files and new users added to the system dynamically. Finally, our performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach has an accuracy of 98.7 percent in detecting anomalies while incurring an overhead of only 2 percent.}

	abstract = {Mobile phishing attacks, such as mimic mobile browser pages, masquerade as legitimate applications by leveraging repackaging or clone techniques, have caused varied yet significant security concerns. Consequently, detection techniques have been receiving increasing attention. However, many such detection methods are not well tested and may therefore still be vulnerable to new types of phishing attacks. In this article, we propose a new attacking technique, named GUI-Squatting attack, which can generate phishing apps (phapps) automatically and effectively on the Android platform. Our method adopts image processing and deep learning algorithms, to enable powerful and large-scale attacks. We observe that a successful phishing attack requires two conditions, page confusion and logic deception during attacks synthesis. We directly optimize these two conditions to create a practical attack. Our experimental results reveal that existing phishing defenses are less effective against such emergent attacks and may, therefore, stimulate more efficient detection techniques. To further demonstrate that our generated phapps can not only bypass existing detection techniques, but also deceive real users, we conduct a human study and successfully steal users’ login information. The human study also shows that different response messages (e.g., “Crash” and “Server failed”) after pressing the login button mislead users to regard our phapps as functionality problems instead of security threats. Extensive experiments reveal that such newly proposed attacks still remain mostly undetected, and are worth further exploration.}

	abstract = {Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows the data owner to outsource an encrypted database to a remote server in a private manner while maintaining the ability for selectively search. So far, most existing solutions focus on an honest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. A few recent works have attempted to construct verifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on specific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general verification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes. In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the potential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain environments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and efficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of SSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to search keywords in shared documents. We implement prototypes of our two designs and present experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of our decentralized SSE schemes.}

	abstract = {Application repackaging is a severe threat to Android users and the market. Not only does it infringe on intellectual property, but it is also one of the most common ways of propagating mobile malware. Existing countermeasures mostly detect repackaging based on app similarity measurement, which tends to be imprecise when obfuscations are applied to repackaged apps. Moreover, they rely on a central party, typically the hosting app store, to perform the detection, but many app stores fail to commit proper effort to piracy detection. We consider building the application repackaging detection capability into apps, such that user devices are made use to detect repackaging in a decentralized fashion. The main challenge is how to protect the detection code from being manipulated by attacks . We propose a creative use of logic bombs , which are otherwise regularly used in malware. The trigger conditions of bombs are constructed to exploit the differences between the attacker and users, such that a bomb that lies dormant on the attacker side will be activated on the user side. The detection code, which is part of the bomb payload , is executed only if the bomb is activated. We introduce cryptographically obfuscated logic bomb to enhance the bomb: (1) the detection code is woven into the neighboring original app code, (2) the mixed code gets encrypted using a key, and (3) the key is deleted from the app and can only be derived when the bomb is activated. Thus, attacks that try to modify or delete the detection code will corrupt the app itself, and searching the key in the application will be in vain. Moreover, we propose a bomb spraying technique that allows many bombs to be injected into an app, multiplying the needed adversary effort for bypassing the detection. In addition to repackaging detection, we present application tampering detection to fight attacks that insert malicious code into repackaged apps. We have implemented a prototype, named BombDroid , that builds repackaging and tampering detection into apps through bytecode instrumentation. The evaluation and the security analysis show that the technique is effective, efficient, and resilient to various bomb analysis techniques including fuzzing, symbolic execution, multi-path exploration, and program slicing. Ethical issues due to the use of logic bombs are also discussed.}

	abstract = {It is increasingly popular to leverage the wisdom of crowd for knowledge discovery and monetization. Among others, crowdsensing with truth discovery has emerged as a promising way for leveraging the crowd wisdom, which can mine reliable knowledge from the generally unreliable sensory data contributed collected from diverse sources. Building a knowledge marketplace based on crowdsensing with truth discovery for knowledge discovery and monetization, however, is non-trivial and has to overcome several challenges. First, the sensory data should be protected as they may carry sensitive information. Second, many real crowdsensing applications usually yield sensory data in a streaming fashion, posing the demand that truth discovery should be conducted over data streams to continuously mine reliable knowledge in each data collection epoch. Third, knowledge monetization should be well treated, fully addressing the practical needs of parties in the monetization ecosystem. In this article, we take the first research attempt and propose a new full-fledged framework for building a secure knowledge marketplace over crowdsensed data streams. Our marketplace supports secure monetization of reliable knowledge mined privately from data streams in crowdsensing applications. Our framework leverages lightweight cryptographic techniques like additive secret sharing to enable privacy-preserving streaming truth discovery, continuously producing reliable knowledge over data streams. For monetization of the learned truth, i.e., knowledge, we resort to the emerging blockchain technology and deliver a tailored and full-fledged design, which promises monetization fairness, knowledge confidentiality, and streamlined processing. Extensive experiments on Amazon cloud and Ethereum blockchain demonstrate the practically affordable performance of our design.}

	abstract = {Network tomography is an important tool to estimate link metrics from end-to-end network measurements. An implicit assumption in network tomography is that observed measurements indeed reflect the aggregate of link performance (i.e., seeing is believing ). However, it is not guaranteed today that there exists no anomaly (e.g., malicious autonomous systems and insider threats) in large-scale networks. Malicious nodes can intentionally manipulate link metrics via delaying or dropping packets to affect measurements. Will such an assumption render a vulnerability when facing attackers? The problem is of essential importance in that network tomography is developed towards effective network diagnostics and failure recovery. In this article, we demonstrate that the vulnerability is real and propose a new attack strategy, called measurement integrity attack , in which malicious nodes can substantially damage a network (e.g., delaying packets) and at the same time maliciously manipulate end-to-end measurement results such that a legitimate node is misleadingly identified as the root cause of the damage (thereby becoming a scapegoat) under network tomography. We formulate three basic attack approaches and show under what conditions attacks can be successful. We also reveal conditions to detect and locate such attacks in a network. Our theoretical and experimental results show that simply trusting measurements leads to measurement integrity vulnerabilities. Thus, existing methods should be revisited accordingly for security in various applications.}

In this work, we design Speech Sanitizer to perturb users’ speech recordings so that the sanitized speech can be safely shared with third parties. First, we desensitize speech content by identifying sensitive words, localizing them in the audio using DTW-based keyword spotting, and substituting them with safe words. Both common and personalized sensitive words are identified and replaced. Then, we anonymize users’ voiceprints with a carefully designed voice conversion mechanism that is resistant to de-anonymization attacks. Meanwhile, we try to preserve the utility of the sanitized speech, measured by the accuracy of speech recognition performed on it. We implement Speech Sanitizer and present extensive experimental results that validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms. It is demonstrated that we are able to reduce the chance of a user's voice being identified from 50 people by 83.7 percent while keeping the drop of speech recognition accuracy within 19.1 percent. We can also easily relax the privacy level to improve speech recognition accuracy.}

	abstract = {With the rapidly growing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart traffic applications, vehicle trajectory data are ubiquitously generated, e.g., from GPS navigation systems, mobile applications, and urban traffic cameras. Analyzing such fine-grained data would greatly benefit the development of ITS and smart cities, yet pose severe privacy risks due to the recorded drivers’ visited locations, routes, and driving habits. Recently, some privacy enhancing techniques were proposed to sanitize such data. However, such schemes have some major limitations–they either lack formal privacy notions to quantify and bound the privacy risks, or result in very limited utility, e.g., only a sequence of locations or aggregated information can be released (without retaining the speeds, accelerations and the timestamps of vehicles). In this article, we propose a novel framework to sanitize the fine-grained vehicle trajectories with differential privacy (VTDP), which provides rigorous privacy protection against adversaries who possess arbitrary background knowledge. Our VTDP technique involves three phases of differentially private sampling, which sequentially generate all the three categories of data (besides a pseudo identity for each vehicle)– position, moving, and timestamps . It also includes a vehicle trajectory interpolation procedure to further improve the output utility with the properties of fine-grained vehicle trajectory data. We conducted experiments on real vehicle trajectory datasets to validate the performance of our approach.}

	abstract = {It is increasingly important and a big challenge to detect intrusion behavior variants in today's world. Previous host-based intrusion detection methods typically explore the sequence of system calls or unix shell commands to detect the intrusion behavior. This article abstracts the detection of intrusion behavior variants as the comparison between different sequences when the sequence order or length transforms. To overcome the impact of sequence transformation on the detection accuracy, we propose P-Gaussian, a provenance-based Gaussian distribution detection scheme which comprises two key design features: (1) it utilizes provenance to describe and identify intrusion behavior variants, and eliminates the impact of sequence order transformation on the detection accuracy. (2) it adopts Gaussian distribution principle to accurately compute the similarity between intrusion behavior and its variant, and eliminates the impact of intrusion behavior sequence length increase on the detection accuracy. To improve the detection performance, P-Gaussian employs a Redis memory database with multiple Redis instances and multiple threads to enable the parallelism of provenance processing in multi-core environments. It also classifies hot and cold provenance to provide high-efficient long-term forensic analysis. Experimental results on widely-used real world applications demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our system.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing is one of the most effective vulnerability detection techniques, widely used in practice. However, the performance of fuzzers may be limited by their inability to pass complicated checks, inappropriate mutation frequency, arbitrary mutation strategy, or the variability of the environment. In this article, we present DeepFuzzer, an enhanced greybox fuzzer with qualified seed generation, balanced seed selection, and hybrid seed mutation. First, we use symbolic execution in a lightweight approach to generate qualified initial seeds which then guide the fuzzer through complex checks. Second, we apply a statistical seed selection algorithm to balance the mutation frequency between different seeds. Further, we develop a hybrid mutation strategy. The random and restricted mutation strategies are combined to maintain a dynamic balance between global exploration and deep search. We evaluate DeepFuzzer on the widely used benchmark Google fuzzer-test-suite which consists of real-world programs. Compared with AFL, AFLFast, FairFuzz, QSYM, and MOPT in the 24-hour experiment, DeepFuzzer discovers 30, 240, 102, 147, and 257 percent more unique crashes, executes 40, 36, 36, 98, and 15 percent more paths, and covers 37, 34, 34, 101, and 11 percent more branches, respectively.

	abstract = {There has recently been a significant growth in resource-constrained devices (RCDs) that exchange sensitive and private data. Lightweight ciphers are designed to implement confidentiality in RCDs. Hardware implementation of lightweight cipher should minimize resources, including area, power, and energy. Hardware Trojans (HTs) are malicious circuits that are inserted into designs, including lightweight ciphers, to modify cipher behavior and leak sensitive data. Although runtime monitoring is a very effective method to implement design-for-trust and detect hardware trojans, it requires significant resources and degrades performance. The main motivation of this research is to design RCD-friendly runtime monitoring and create a trusted design with minimal resource overhead. This article develops a low-power, low-energy and trusted design based on a smart runtime monitoring algorithm targeted for lightweight ciphers in RCDs, implemented in the FPGA platform. The algorithm is adaptive, minimizes resource, and maximizes confidence and HT detection. The novelties of the algorithm are its adaptive activation of checking and its validation. Checking is triggered when a predefined critical node is active, which limits power/energy overhead. Our proposed algorithm has adaptive positive aging because it forgoes validation when a critical node has been already proven safe. To optimize trust, the validation uses a reverse-function design. The implementation results show that proposed algorithm reduces area, power and energy, when compared with existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves 37%–55% reduction in energy and power, and has an average of 53% improvement in LE×energy metric. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm reduces the area by 25% when both encryption and decryptions are implemented.}

	abstract = {Microphones attracted a lot of attentions from attackers due to the sensitivity of voice data: attackers may control devices through abusing their microphones, fingerprint devices by measuring their microphones, or directly monitor the microphone readings to steal users’ private data. Nevertheless, OS developers failed to address the severe consequences. While the current security mechanism only offers a coarse-grained access control over the usage of microphones: recording all sound or shutting off, it is necessary to redesign the microphone security mechanism to enforce fine-grained restrictions over the usage of microphones. In this article, we propose a fine-grained microphone access control scheme on Android platform, referred to as FMC (Finer Microphone Controller). In our scheme, microphone acoustic permissions are granted with three finer policies: treble policy , timbre policy and exclusion policy , with which most of the attacks mentioned above can be defended against. In addition, to ease user’s policy management, we employ a smart policy recommendation method, avoiding additional manual policy approvals. The results in our experiments show that a negligible 1.06 percent performance overhead is incurred during policy enforcement. Besides, the policy recommendation system in FMC promises an accuracy of 82.82 percent averagely. We believe that our work is a practical defense scheme against attacks exploiting microphone acoustic permissions and should be employed by OS developers.}

Obfuscation-based private web search solutions automatically generate dummy queries and send the obfuscated queries to the search engine to hide users’ search intentions. Despite many obfuscation methods and tools have been developed, there is no practical system for evaluating their utility performance and the vulnerability against modern privacy attacks. In this article, we propose and develop OB-WSPES, a uniform evaluation system for obfuscation-based web search privacy, which allows researchers to conduct fair analysis and evaluation of existing or newly developed web search privacy protection/attack techniques. Leveraging OB-WSPES, we model the obfuscation activities and systematically implement and evaluate five obfuscation schemes and 10 modern web search attacks on the public AOL dataset. Our results demonstrate that, counter-intuitively, adding more fake queries to a user’s real data does not necessarily yield better privacy. The query utility of obfuscated queries declines with the increasing amount of dummy queries, while the application utility does not. We discuss the experimental results and point out the four important factors that affect the web search privacy and utility. Further, we propose possible directions for future research.}

	abstract = {In current steganalysis, relying on a large scale of samples, widely-adopted supervised schemes require the training stage while few studies focus on the design of a training-free unsupervised adaptive detector with high efficiency. To fill the gap, we investigate an adaptive statistical model-based detector designed for detecting JPEG steganography. First, in virtue of hypothesis testing theory, together with the distribution of quantized DCT coefficients, we establish the general framework of the statistical model-based detector. Second, based on the framework, we mainly analyze the performance of the detector relying on the selection of the statistical model, parameters estimation, and less significant payload prediction. Third, to improve the reliability of detection, based on the strategy of assigning weights for DCT channels, the novel adaptive statistical model-based detectors are proposed to aim at detecting JPEG steganography, involving the channel-selected or non-channel-selected algorithm. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Moreover, when detecting JPEG images adopted by two steganographic schemes with the small payload, the experimental results show the Area Under Curve (AUC) of our proposed optimal adaptive detector can achieve as high as 0.9567 and 0.9895 respectively, which are both better than that of non-adaptive detector.}

Vehicle users have better experience by collaborating the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) architectures, and this emerging field is called the Internet of vehicles (IoV). Therefore, the IoV architecture will play an important role in the industry, research organization, and academics for various public and commercial applications. However, the IoV structure should ensure secure and efficient performance for vehicular communications, else an attacker may interfere in the system. In this article, we propose protected comprehensive data dissemination protocols (say IoVCom) based on one-way hash function and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for the IoV structure. Next, we analyze security strengths of the IoVCom against various security attacks and discuss performance results in terms of communication overhead, computation time, storage cost, and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {The 911 emergency service belongs to one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors in the United States. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks launched from a mobile phone botnet pose a significant threat to the availability of this vital service. In this article we show how attackers can launch several types of DDoS attacks from mobile phone botnets. In one of the attacks, which we demonstrate, the attacker has the botnet randomize all cellular identifiers while issuing emergency calls repeatedly. Since there exists legitimate unidentified emergency calls, and since the FCC requires such calls to be forwarded, the network and the emergency call centers cannot block these calls (technically and legally). To understand and verify the threat of DDoS attacks on 911, we explore the 911 infrastructure and implement different forms of the attack on a small cellular network. Finally, to quantify the threat, we simulate and analyze DDoS attacks on a model of current 911 infrastructure in the US. We found that with less than 6K bots (or $100K hardware), attackers can block emergency services in an entire state for days. We believe that this article will assist the respective organizations in preventing possible 911-DDoS attacks in the future.}

	abstract = {The emergence of cloud infrastructure has significantly reduced the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. To ensure security, the data is usually encrypted before it's outsourced to the cloud. Unlike searching and sharing the plain data, it is challenging to search and share the data after encryption. Nevertheless, it is a critical task for the cloud service provider as the users expect the cloud to conduct a quick search and return the result without losing data confidentiality. To overcome these problems, we propose a ciphertext-policy attribute-based mechanism with keyword search and data sharing (CPAB-KSDS) for encrypted cloud data. The proposed solution not only supports attribute-based keyword search but also enables attribute-based data sharing at the same time, which is in contrast to the existing solutions that only support either one of two features. Additionally, the keyword in our scheme can be updated during the sharing phase without interacting with the PKG. In this article, we describe the notion of CPAB-KSDS as well as its security model. Besides, we propose a concrete scheme and prove that it is against chosen ciphertext attack and chosen keyword attack secure in the random oracle model. Finally, the proposed construction is demonstrated practical and efficient in the performance and property comparison.}

	abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) plays an essential role in daily life. However, currently deployed IR technologies, e.g., Apache Lucene – open-source search software, are insufficient when the information is protected or deemed to be private. For example, submitting a query to a publicly available search engine (e.g., Bing or Google) requires disclosing potentially delicate facts (e.g., thoughts about abortion), as well as the websites the user considers interesting. Similarly, when a private database contains sensitive information needed by the user, it cannot be searched freely. Over the past decade, various approaches, generally referred to as private information retrieval, have been proposed to obfuscate queries and responses, but they are limited in that the retrieved information is inadequate to compute relevancy. To address such limitations, this article introduces the necessary techniques to build Lucene-P\n2\nthat allows one party to discover whether a second party harbors any relevant textual information without either party disclosing any information.}

In the MCC setting, since many mobile applications (e.g., map apps) interacting with cloud server and application server need to perform computation with the private data of users, it is important to realize secure computation for MCC. In this article, we propose an efficient server-aided secure two-party computation (2PC) protocol for MCC. This is the first work that considers collusion between a malicious garbled circuit evaluator and a semi-honest server while ensuring privacy and correctness. Also, it can guarantee fairness when collusion does not exist. The security analysis shows that our protocol can securely compute any function f(x, y) against different types of adversaries in the malicious model. Also, the experimental performance analysis shows that this work outperforms the previous works for at least 10 times with the same security level.}

	abstract = {Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a timely complement of cloud-based AI. By introducing intelligence to the edge, it alleviates privacy concerns of streaming and storing data to the cloud, enables real-time operations where milliseconds matter, and brings AI services to remote areas with poor networking infrastructures. Security is a significant problem in Edge AI applications such as self-driving cars and intelligent healthcare. Since the edge devices are empowered to process data and take actions, attacking and compromising them can cause serious damage. However, the wide deployment of computationally limited devices in edge environments and the increasing happening of side-channel (or leakage) attacks pose critical challenges to security. This article thereby aims to enhance the security for Edge AI by designing and developing lightweight and leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange (LRAKE) protocols. Compared with available LRAKE protocols, the proposed protocols in this article can be effortless applied in some mainstreaming security and communication standards. Moreover, this article realizes prototypes and presents implementation details; and a use case of applying the proposed protocol in Bluetooth 5.0 is illustrated. The theoretical design and implementation details will provide a guidance of applying the LRAKE protocols in Edge AI applications.}

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most promising information-centric networking architectures that can improve the network performance by supporting the large scale content distribution. However, the use of in-network caching mechanism increases the opportunity of cache pollution attack, where the attackers intend to reduce the cache hit of legal users by releasing fake requests to fill the precious cache with non-popular contents. To prevent the degradation of network performance caused by such an attack, it is becoming particularly important to detect the attack and then throttle it. In this article, we propose a detection and defense scheme with the help of grey forecast, which can effectively exploit the regularity of past Interests and popularity by comprehensively considering three major factors to predict the future popularity of each cached content. If the predicted popularity of any content differs too much from the actually calculated one in several consecutive slices, the pollution attack will be determined. Once the attack is detected, the defense will be taken by suppressing the popularity increase of the suspicious content to mitigate the damage of the pollution attack. We also consider a special case, where there exists a sudden burst of traffic from legal users that cannot be simply dropped. The simulations in ndnSIM indicate that our proposed method is effective in detecting and defending the pollution attack with higher cache hit, higher detecting ratio, and lower hop count compared to other state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {To achieve security and privacy for data stored on the cloud, we need the ability to secure data in compute. Equality comparisons, “ $x=y, x\\ne y$ ”, have been widely studied with many proposals but there is much room for improvement for order comparisons, “ $x < y,~x \\leq y,~x > y \\text{ and } x \\geq y$ ”. Most protocols for order comparisons have some limitation, either leaking some information about the data or requiring several rounds of communication between client and server. In addition, little work has been done on retrieving with compound conditions, mixing several equality and order comparisons. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) promises the ability to compute arbitrary functions on encrypted data without sacrificing privacy and without communication, but its potential has yet to be fulfilled. Particularly, private comparisons for database queries using FHE are expensive to compute. In this article, we design an efficient private database query (PDQ) protocol which supports compound conditions with equality and order comparisons. To this end, we first present a private comparison algorithm on encrypted integers using FHE, which scales efficiently for the length of input integers, by applying techniques from finite field theory. Then, we consider a scenario for PDQ protocols, querying for values based on a conjunction of one order and four equality conditions on key columns. The proposed algorithm and protocol are implemented and tested to determine their performance in practice. The proposed comparison algorithm takes about $25.259$ seconds to compare 697 pairs of 64-bit integers using Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan's leveled FHE scheme with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) techniques at more than 138 bits of security. This yields an amortized rate of just 36 milliseconds per comparison. On top of that, we show that our techniques achieve an efficient PDQ protocol for one order and four equality comparisons, achieving an amortized time and communication cost of 57 milliseconds and 448 bytes per database element.}

	abstract = {To date, cloud computing has emerged as a primary utility for providing remote data storage services for users, since users can thus be relieved from cumbersome document maintenance. Despite of the benefits brought by data outsourcing, the unexpected data breaches raise concerns about data confidentiality and privacy. To deal with this, a straightforward and convincing strategy is to encrypt data before outsourcing them to the cloud. However, securely sharing and searching over outsourced encrypted data has turned into a challenge due to the hindrance led by data encryption. To address the challenge, this article proposes a new highly-scalable searchable encryption scheme for encrypted cloud storage. The scheme achieves sub-linear Boolean keyword searching, and moreover allows the data owner to authorize which clients could search or access the documents in the cloud. Technically, we revisit searchable symmetric encryption primitive by non-trivially combining it with a novel access control technique, and build an inverted index data structure for both attribute-based access control and sub-linear search process. Furthermore, we introduce a formalized security definition for the system, and prove its security in the simulation-based security model. Finally, we conduct a couple of experiments over a representative real-world dataset to show practicality.}

	abstract = {In the softwarized fifth generation (5G) networks, authentication protocols are deployed by both the mobile network operators and the third-party service providers to enable secure slice formation at the network side and user validation at the service provider side, respectively. However, the usage of static key-based authentication protocols in 5G networks gives rise to two major problems: (i) network slice topology learning attack during the formation of slice and (ii) exposure of users’ service access behavior to the third-party service providers and device-to-device communication peers. In this article, we propose group anonymous (i) privacy preserving mutual authentication (PPMA) and (ii) privacy preserving one-way authentication (PPOA) protocols to address the aforementioned problems, respectively. We also prove the security of the PPMA and PPOA protocols against the chosen ciphertext attack in the random oracle model. The PPMA and PPOA protocols are implemented using the JPBC library and the computation overhead is measured. For 1024 bits discrete logarithm security, the computation overhead of the PPMA and PPOA protocols is respectively 48.54 and 68.65 percent lower than an existing privacy preserving authentication protocol on an Intel processor. The PPMA and PPOA protocols are generic and can be applied in peer-to-peer authentication scenarios where group anonymity and privacy preservation are considered.}

We propose Caesar , a novel multi-leader Generalized Consensus protocol, most suitable for geographical replication, that is optimized for low-to-moderate contention. With an evaluation study, we show that Caesar outperforms other multi-leader (e.g., EPaxos) and single-leader (e.g., Multi-Paxos) competitors by up to 1.7x and 3.5x, respectively, in the presence of 30 percent conflicting requests, in a geo-replicated setting. Furthermore, we acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits- all consensus solution, especially for all levels of contentious workloads. Thus, we also propose Spectrum , a consensus framework that is able to switch consensus protocols at runtime to enable a dynamic reaction to changes in the workload and deployment characteristics. We show empirically that Spectrum can guarantee high availability even during periods of transition between consensus protocols.}

When such an SoC miscomputes or performs below expectation in-field, it is unclear which of the on-chip components caused the failure. The customer would like to use SoCs that provide the property of accountability, wherein the failure-causing component, and consequently its designing organization, can be unambiguously detected. Since it is a matter of trust, the various parties involved desire formal guarantees regarding any accountability solution. The solution must find the guilty component(s) in the event of a chip failure. Additionally, the solution must not falsely implicate any component that functioned correctly. This article formally describes the property of accountability, a formal methodology of constructing an accountability solution, and a formal game-theory based methodology to reason about and prove the viability of a proposed solution. We explore the entire space of solutions, and characterize the attack surface and methods to provide accountability for each setting.

	abstract = {With the growth of public demand for online access to health services, many efforts have been devoted to personal health records (PHR) in cloud computing. It enables patients to manage their personal health information (PHI) in cloud servers, which greatly facilitates the collection, access and sharing of PHI. Since cloud servers are not fully trusted, it is desirable that the PHI can be encrypted for privacy protection before uploaded to the cloud. Besides the privacy of PHI, fine-grained and flexible search control is also strongly desired for a secure PHR system. In this article, we first present attribute set based keyword search (ASBKS) which can realize fine-grained keyword search of encrypted PHR. Compared with the existing searchable encryption with access control, the proposed ASBKS can achieve more flexibility in user attributes organization and more efficiency in specifying policies. Furthermore, we present a hierarchical ASBKS scheme to improve scalability by extending ASBKS with a hierarchical structure of users. We implement our ASBKS scheme and the experimental results demonstrate that it is both efficient and flexible for encrypted PHR in cloud computing.}

	abstract = {Captcha, which can prevent computer programs from attacking websites, has been the most important security technology for many years. The most popularly deployed Captcha is the text-based scheme. The vast majority of the existing text Captchas are designed with English letters and Arabic numerals. Recently, text Captchas with large character sets are being increasingly popular. From the perspective of attackers, larger character set means greater solution space and better theoretical security. However, the security of Captchas with large character sets in real world has never been studied comprehensively. In this article, we introduce a simple, fast, and effective deep learning method to attack these newly emerging Captchas. Taking 11 Chinese Captchas as representatives, we ran our experimental attack on each of them. Our attack achieved high success rates, ranging from 34.7 to 86.9 percent at an average speed of 0.175 seconds on these schemes. All of the results show that the Chinese text Captcha can be easily broken, demonstrating that text Captchas with large character sets are also insecure in existing forms. As a substitute, we proposed a 3D image-based scheme combining semantic comprehension and dragging action. The preliminary experimental results show that it is more robust than current text-based schemes.}

	abstract = {In the recent decade, deep learning techniques have been widely adopted for founding artificial Intelligent applications, which led to successes in many data analysis tasks, such as risk assessment, medical predictions, and face recognition. Since the effectiveness of deep learning is directly proportional to the amount of data available, a large-scale collection of massive data is essential. Considering privacy and security concerns often prevent data owners from contributing sensitive data for training, researchers proposed several techniques to provide privacy guarantees of data in machine learning systems that contains multiple parties. However, all these works incurred frequent interactions between data owners during training, such that they came at a high communicational cost for data owners. To this end, in this article, we propose a new server-aid framework called non-interactive privacy-preserving multi-party machine learning (NPMML), which supports secure machine learning tasks without the participation of data owners. The NPMML framework significantly reduces data owners’ communicational overheads in multi-party machine learning. Moreover, we design a concrete construction for multi-layer neural networks based on NPMML. Finally, we evaluate the performance of NPMML by prototype implementation. The experimental result demonstrates that NPMML is communicational-efficient for data owners.}

	abstract = {Mobile devices have been an integral part of our everyday lives. Users’ increasing interaction with mobile devices brings in significant concerns on various types of potential privacy leakage, among which location privacy draws the most attention. Specifically, mobile users’ trajectories constructed by location data may be captured by adversaries to infer sensitive information. In previous studies, differential privacy has been utilized to protect published trajectory data with rigorous privacy guarantee. Strong protection provided by differential privacy distorts the original locations or trajectories using stochastic noise to avoid privacy leakage. In this article, we propose a novel location inference attack framework, iTracker, which simultaneously recovers multiple trajectories from differentially private trajectory data using the structured sparsity model. Compared with the traditional recovery methods based on single trajectory prediction, iTracker, which takes advantage of the correlation among trajectories discovered by the structured sparsity model, is more effective in recovering multiple private trajectories simultaneously. iTracker successfully attacks the existing privacy protection mechanisms based on differential privacy. We theoretically demonstrate the near-linear runtime of iTracker, and the experimental results using two real-world datasets show that iTracker outperforms existing recovery algorithms in recovering multiple trajectories.}

	abstract = {Voice interface has been a dominant User Interface (UI) channel in the popular smart home environment. Although Voice Control System (VCS) brings users conveniences, it is extremely vulnerable to spoofing attacks (e.g., hidden/inaudible command attack) due to its broadcast nature. In this study, to thwart spoofing attacks, we propose WSVA, a device-free voice liveness detection system based on the prevalent wireless signals generated by IoT devices without requiring user to carry any additional sensor or device. The basic insight of WSVA to distinguish the authentic voice command from a spoofed one is checking the consistency between the voice signal and its corresponding mouth motions, which can be captured by wireless signals. To achieve this goal, WSVA builds a theoretical model to describe the correlations among the wireless signal changes, the mouth motions, and the syllables in the voice command. Then, WSVA selects appropriate features from both voice and wireless signals, and calculates the consistency between these two types of signals to determine whether the VCS is suffering from the spoofing attack. To demonstrate the feasibility of WSVA, we conduct a case study on Samsung SmartThings platform and include WSVA as a new application, which is expected to significantly enhance the security of the existing VCS. We evaluate WSVA with various voice commands in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that WSVA achieves the overall 99 percent true accept rate with 1 percent false accept rate with a good scalability and low latency.}

	abstract = {A recent development emanating from RFID technology is Near Field Communication (NFC). Basically, NFC is a popular short range (<10 cm) wireless communication technology with applications in areas sensitive to security and privacy concerns such as contactless payment. Since NFC communications require very close proximity between two communicating devices (e.g., a smartcard and a terminal), it is generally believed that Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are practically infeasible here. Contrasting this belief, in this paper, we successfully establish MITM attack in NFC communications between a passive tag and an active terminal. We carefully present physical fundamentals of the attack, our engineering design, and results of successful attack implementation. Subsequently, we present the practical applicability of our MITM attack that exploits a potential vulnerability in EMV based contactless payment protocol, which arises due to separation between card authentication and transaction authorization phases. We demonstrate how an attacker can compromise the integrity of a contactless payment using a malicious MITM card, and also present multiple attack/victim scenarios to analyze different types of impacts of our attack. Further, we conduct rigorous experimental studies to analyze both hardware and practical ramifications of our attack. Finally, we propose a mechanism to detect the MITM attack based on experimental analysis that demands no additional hardware.}
