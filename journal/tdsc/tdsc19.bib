	abstract = {IoT devices are increasingly being implicated in cyber-attacks, raising community concern about the risks they pose to critical infrastructure, corporations, and citizens. In order to reduce this risk, the IETF is pushing IoT vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose of their IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that their network behavior in any operating environment can be locked down and verified rigorously. This article aims to assist IoT manufacturers in developing and verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices to ensure they are compatible with their organizational policies and track device network behavior using their MUD profile. Our first contribution is to develop a tool that takes the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input and automatically generates the MUD profile for it. We contribute our tool as open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights and challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a formal semantic framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for consistency, but also checks its compatibility with a given organizational policy. We apply our framework to representative organizations and selected devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT acceptance testing. Finally, we show how operators can dynamically identify IoT devices using known MUD profiles and monitor their behavioral changes in their network.}

	abstract = {In disaster areas, a large amount of data (e.g., rescue commands, road damage, and rescue experience) should be delivered among ground rescuing vehicles for safe driving and efficient rescue. When communication infrastructures are destroyed by disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to perform immediate rescue missions in destroyed areas and assist data sharing for ground Internet of vehicles (IoV). However, in such UAV-assisted IoV under disaster situation, there exist potential security threats on data sharing among vehicles and UAVs because of the untrusted network environment, unreliable misbehavior tracing, and low-quality shared data. To address these issues, in this article, we develop a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data sharing framework in UAV-aided IoV for disaster rescue. First, we propose a novel UAV and blockchain-assisted collaborative aerial-ground network architecture in disaster areas. Second, we develop a credit-based consensus algorithm in the lightweight vehicular blockchain to securely and immutably trace misbehaviors and record data transactions for UAVs and vehicles with improved efficiency and security in reaching consensus. Third, since UAVs and vehicles have little explicit knowledge of the whole network, we develop reinforcement learning-based algorithms to optimally schedule the pricing and quality of data sharing strategies for both data contributor and data consumer via trial and error. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate that LVBS can effectively improve the security of consensus phase and promote high-quality data sharing.}

	abstract = {Self-stabilization refers to the ability of systems to recover after temporal violations of conditions required for their correct operation. Such violations may lead the system to an arbitrary state from which it should automatically recover. Typically, a self-stabilizing algorithm is examined for eventual functionality, namely, whether the algorithm eventually exhibit the desired input output relation. In this article, we extend the typical functionality criteria to include the recovery of privacy and security aspects. In cryptographic protocol problems, two or more parties want to perform some joint computation, while guaranteeing security properties against adversarial behavior. Current cryptographic protocols guarantee these security properties as long as the adversary is limited to compromise only a fraction of the parties. However, in reality, the adversary may compromise all the parties of the system for a while. We introduce the notion of Self-Stabilizing Secure Computation, a design that ensures that the security properties of computation are automatically regained, even if at some point the entire system is compromised. We then propose a self-stabilizing secure protocol for the evaluation of a reactive functionality which yields a computation of a virtual global finite state machine.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have the potential to enable the next-generation Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In ITS, data contributed by vehicles can build a spatio-temporal view of traffic statistics, which can improve road safety and reduce slow traffic and jams. To preserve drivers’ privacy, vehicles should use multiple pseudonyms instead of only one identity. However, vehicles may exploit this abundance of pseudonyms and launch Sybil attacks by pretending to be multiple vehicles. Then, these Sybil (or fake) vehicles report false data, e.g., to create fake congestion or pollute traffic management data. In this article, we propose a Sybil attack detection scheme using proofs of work and location. The idea is that each road side unit (RSU) issues a signed time-stamped tag as a proof for the vehicle’s anonymous location. Proofs sent from multiple consecutive RSUs are used to create a trajectory which is used as vehicle anonymous identity. Also, contributions from one RSU are not enough to create trajectories, rather the contributions of several RSUs are needed. By this way, attackers need to compromise an infeasible number of RSUs to create fake trajectories. Moreover, upon receiving the proof of location from an RSU, the vehicle should solve a computational puzzle by running proof of work (PoW) algorithm. Then, it should provide a valid solution (proof of work) to the next RSU before it can obtain a proof of location. Using the PoW can prevent the vehicles from creating multiple trajectories in case of low-dense RSUs. To report an event, the vehicle has to send the latest trajectory to an event manager. Then, the event manager uses a matching technique to identify the trajectories sent from Sybil vehicles. The scheme depends on the fact that the Sybil trajectories are bounded physically to one vehicle, and therefore, their trajectories should overlap. Extensive experiments and simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves high detection rate of Sybil attacks with low false negative and acceptable communication and computation overhead.}

	abstract = {Multimodal biometric systems provide prospective advantages over traditional unimodal systems and are employed diversely for numerous applications. However, issues of data privacy and identity-theft emerges with the extensive use of these systems. To address these issues we propose a multimodal cancelable biometric system based on realtime Deep Feature Unification (DFU). For this, keys-based generic feature extraction is introduced to achieve revocability and dimensionality reduction. Non-invertibility is obtained through random projection of Key Deep features to Query Deep features. Proposed adaptive graph-based fusion process not only extracts complementary information across multiple modalities but also generates multimodal Unified template. The cross diffusion of normalized and optimal graphs ensure the unlinkability and robustness to dynamic environment. Proposed biometric system is assessed over benchmark datasets and shows promising performance against state-of-the-art methods. Average DI and EER achieved by proposed method are 10.35 and 0.12, respectively. Further, robustness against adversary attacks is demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Since big data becomes a main impetus to the next generation of IT industry, data privacy has received considerable attention in recent years. To deal with the privacy challenges, differential privacy has been widely discussed and related private mechanisms are proposed as privacy-enhancing techniques. However, with today’s differential privacy techniques, it is difficult to generate a sanitized dataset that can suit every machine learning task. In order to adapt to various tasks and budgets, different kinds of privacy mechanisms have to be implemented, which inevitably incur enormous costs for computation and interaction. To this end, in this article, we propose two novel schemes for outsourcing differential privacy. The first scheme efficiently achieves outsourcing differential privacy by using our preprocessing method and secure building blocks. To support the queries from multiple evaluators, we give the second scheme that employs a trusted execution environment to aggregately implement privacy mechanisms on multiple queries. During data publishing, our proposed schemes allow providers to go off-line after uploading their datasets, so that they achieve a low communication cost which is one of the critical requirements for a practical system. Finally, we report an experimental evaluation on UCI datasets, which confirms the effectiveness of our schemes.}

In the recent years, much effort has been made to evaluate the password strength or to generate strong passwords. Unfortunately, the usability or memorability of the strong passwords has been largely neglected. In this article, we aim to bridge the gap between strong password generation and the usability of strong passwords. We propose to automatically generate textual password mnemonics, i.e., natural language sentences, which are intended to help users better memorize passwords. We introduce DeepMnemonic , a deep attentive encoder-decoder framework which takes a password as input and then automatically generates a mnemonic sentence for the password. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate DeepMnemonic on the real-world data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepMnemonic outperforms a well-known baseline for generating semantically meaningful mnemonic sentences. Moreover, the user study further validates that the generated mnemonic sentences by DeepMnemonic are useful in helping users memorize strong passwords.}

	abstract = {Nearest neighbor query processing is a fundamental problem that arises in many fields such as spatial databases and machine learning. This article aims to address the Secure Nearest Neighbor (SNN) problem in cloud computing. Prior SNN schemes are both insecure and inefficient. In this article, we formally prove and experimentally demonstrate that the SNN scheme ASPE is actually insecure against even ciphertext only attacks. Although prior work proved that it is impossible to construct an SNN scheme even in much relaxed standard security models, we point out the flaws of the hardness proof. We propose an SNN scheme and prove that it is secure against adaptive chosen keyword attacks. Our scheme is efficient as its query processing complexity is logarithmic. To evaluate the efficiency of our SNN scheme, we implemented our scheme in C++ and compared its performance with a plain text scheme, binary scheme, and a PIR scheme on a large set of over 10 million real-world data points. Experimental results show that our scheme is fast (0.124 millisecond per query when data set size is 10 million) and scalable in terms of the number of data points.}

Without such view, researchers incur the risk of developing systems that only detect outdated threats, missing the most recent ones. In this article, we conduct the largest measurement of Android malware behavior to date, analyzing over 1.2 million malware samples that belong to 1.28K families over a period of eight years (from 2010 to 2017). We aim at understanding how Android malware has evolved over time, focusing on repackaging malware. In this type of threat different innocuous apps are piggybacked with a malicious payload (rider), allowing inexpensive malware manufacturing. One of the main challenges posed when studying repackaged malware is slicing the app to split benign components apart from the malicious ones. To address this problem, we use differential analysis to isolate software components that are irrelevant to the campaign and study the behavior of malicious riders alone. Our analysis framework relies on collective repositories and recent advances on the systematization of intelligence extracted from multiple anti-virus vendors. We find that since its infancy in 2010, the Android malware ecosystem has changed significantly, both in the type of malicious activity performed by malware and in the level of obfuscation used to avoid detection. Finally, we discuss what our findings mean for Android malware detection research, highlighting areas that need further attention by the research community. In particular, we show that riders of malware families evolve over time. This evidences important experimental bias in research works levering on automated systems for family identification without considering variants.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing explosive growth and has gained extensive attention from academia and industry in recent years. However, most of the existing IoT infrastructures are centralized, which may cause the issues of unscalability and single-point-of-failure. Consequently, decentralized IoT has been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology called blockchain. Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, for example a leader election in wireless sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to unsuitable, traditional centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues caused by malicious voters. To address these issues, in this article, we introduce a framework of the self-tallying voting system in decentralized IoT based on blockchain. We propose a concrete construction and prove that the proposed system satisfies all the security requirements, including fairness, dispute-freeness, and maximal ballot secrecy. We simulate the algorithms on a laptop, an Android phone, and a Raspberry Pi to test the time consumption and evaluate the gas cost of each algorithm in a private blockchain as well. The implementation results demonstrate the practicability of our system.}

	abstract = {The rapid and wide adoption of microgrids (MGs) and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) have created a unique opportunity for the integration of these technologies. In this article, we address the issue of demand response of EVs during MG outages by leveraging Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. Particularly, we investigate an auction trading market that allows EVs with surplus energy to act as sellers, and EVs that want to be charged to act as buyers. A novel distributed double auction scheme is proposed to allow each buyer EV to submit multiple bids to seller EVs in different parking lots. Nonetheless, the locations of buyer EVs could be inferred by an adversary through analyzing the valuations, posing serious privacy and security risks. In this regard, a valuation-based attack scheme is investigated to validate the potential privacy risk. To defend against such an attack, we present a location privacy-preserving double auction scheme, in which the MicroGrid Central Controller (MGCC) acts as the auctioneer, solving the social welfare maximization problem of matching buyers to sellers, and the cloud is used to conduct calculations for the auctioneer, protecting the privacy of participants via homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis is conducted to validate our auction scheme in satisfying the designed economic and privacy properties (e.g., strategy-proofness and\nk\n-anonymity). The experimental results show that our auction scheme can not only mitigate the demand response problem in MGs, but also provides good performance with respect to social welfare, satisfaction ratio, computational and communication overhead, and privacy leakage.}

	abstract = {A common practice in data redaction is removing sensitive information prior to data publication or release. In data-driven applications, one must be convinced that the redacted data is still trustworthy. Meanwhile, the data redactor must be held accountable for (malicious) redaction, which could change/hide the meaning of the original data. Motivated by these concerns, we present a novel solution for authenticated data redaction based on a new Redactable Signature Scheme with Implicit Accountability (\\mathsf {RSS}\nRSS-\\mathsf {IA}\nIA). In the event of a dispute, not only the original data signer but also the redactor can generate an evidence tag to unequivocally identify the party who produced the data/signature pair. Without the evidence tag, the redaction operation is transparent. Furthermore, the redactor can independently prove the trustworthiness of the redacted data, without any interaction with the original data signer. Our design is built on a new approach which adds accountability to any transparent redactable signature schemes. We show that the proposed design satisfies all the security goals with affordable cost. As an extension, we show how to realize accountable, transparent and authenticated data redaction in the multi-redactor setting.}

	abstract = {The broad applicability of Internet of Things (IoT) would truly enable the pervasiveness of smart devices for sensing data. In this context, achieving service personalization requires collecting sensitive data about users. That yields to privacy concerns due to the possibility of abusing the data through unauthorized access. Moreover, IoT devices have limited computing resources, making them difficult to perform heavy protection mechanisms. Despite several existing solutions for privacy protection, they were not designed to run on limited resources in large scale environment. In addition, existing access control solutions, including XACML, are heavy to run on resource constraint devices and lack behavior-based customization of user privacy where users have little to no control over their private data. In this regard, we address the aforementioned problems by proposing LP-SBA-XACML, which embeds an efficient and lightweight semantics-based scheme targeting user privacy and providing efficient policy evaluation. LP-SBA-XACML is a scalable and lightweight solution suitable for the IoT context while preserving the assumptions of XACML. Moreover, an intelligent model for real-time behavior/activity prediction is integrated to systematically customize user’s privacy and services. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-life scenarios demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of our proposed framework within a mobile IoT resource-constrained environment.}

	abstract = {To mitigate the attacks by malicious peers and to isolate them in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, several reputation systems have been proposed in the past. The relative ranking method is the most popular among them. In this method, peers are ranked according to their reputation in the network. The major limitation of this method is that it does not give any absolute interpretation about the peers, it can only differentiate among the given set of peers. This is more significant when all the peers responding to a query, are malicious. In such a situation, we can only know that who is better among them without knowing their actual reputation in the whole network. In this article, we are proposing a new algorithm which can rank the peers in the whole network as well as can give an absolute interpretation of their reputation. Consequently, we can identify them as good peers or malicious peers. Further, by choosing the suitable values of parameters, our algorithm converges much faster at some global consensus. Simulation results show that it performs better in load balancing and in reducing the inauthentic downloads in the network as compared to the existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Much attention is being paid to security requirements of workflow processes with authorization policies, e.g., safety properties, liveness properties, separation of duties, binding of duties, and constraints of cardinality. However, existing methods neglect the execution condition of activities and the logical structures among activities along with their time attributes, suffer from low efficiency when checking the security requirements of large-scale and structurally complex workflow processes, and provide no solutions as a response to the violations of various security requirements. Thus, existing methods cannot guarantee the absolute security and smooth execution of such workflow processes. In this article, we propose a security team timed automaton (STTA) based approach to analyzing security requirements in timed workflow processes. First, we construct STTAs for timed workflow processes with authorization policies. Second, security requirements are automatically verified based on STTAs. Third, based on two effective strategies, we provide solutions to violated security requirements, if any. Compared with the existing methods, our approach can not only formally describe and analyze five commonly-viewed and frequently-adopted security requirements for timed workflow processes and dramatically decrease their temporal and spatial complexity for verification, but also provide solutions to the violations of security requirements so as to implement the security management of workflow processes.}

	abstract = {Data centers have been growing rapidly in recent years to meet the surging demand of cloud services. However, the expanding scale and powerful servers generate a great amount of heat, resulting in significant cooling costs. A trend in modern data centers is to raise the temperature and maintain all servers in a relatively hot environment. While this can save on cooling costs given benign workloads running in servers, the hot environment increases the risk of a cooling failure. In this article, we unveil a new vulnerability of existing data centers with aggressive cooling energy saving policies. Such a vulnerability might be exploited to launch thermal attacks that could severely worsen the thermal conditions in a data center. Specifically, we conduct thermal measurements and uncover effective thermal attack vectors at the server, rack, and data center levels. We also present damage assessments of thermal attacks. Our results demonstrate that thermal attacks can (1) largely increase the temperature of victim servers degrading their performance and reliability, (2) negatively impact on thermal conditions of neighboring servers causing local hotspots, (3) raise the cooling cost, and (4) even lead to cooling failures. Finally, we propose and evaluate effective server and data center level defenses to enhance thermal stabilities.}

	abstract = {Fault injection (FI) is a commonly used experimental technique to evaluate the resilience of software techniques for tolerating hardware faults. Software-implemented FI can be performed at different levels of abstraction in the system stack; FI performed at the compiler’s intermediate representation (IR) level has the advantage that it is closer to the program being evaluated and is hence easier to derive insights from for the design of software fault-tolerance mechanisms. Unfortunately, it is not clear how accurate IR-level FI is vis-a-vis FI performed at the assembly code level, and prior work has presented contradictory findings. In this article, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of IR-level FI across a range of benchmark programs and compiler optimization levels. Our results show that IR-level FI is as accurate as assembly-level FI for silent data corruption (SDC) probability estimation across different benchmarks and optimization levels. Further, we present a machine-learning-based technique for improving the accuracy of crash probability measurements made by IR-level FI, which takes advantage of an observed correlation between program crash probabilities and instructions that operate on memory address values. We find that the machine learning technique provides comparable accuracy for IR-level FI as assembly code level FI for program crashes.}

However, sharing these graphs poses privacy risks because they contain sensitive information about individuals. Graph anonymization techniques aim to protect individual users in a graph, while graph de-anonymization aims to re-identify users. The effectiveness of anonymization and de-anonymization algorithms is usually evaluated with privacy metrics. However, it is unclear how strong existing privacy metrics are when they are used in graph privacy. In this article, we study 26 privacy metrics for graph anonymization and de-anonymization and evaluate their strength in terms of three criteria: monotonicity indicates whether the metric indicates lower privacy for stronger adversaries; for within-scenario comparisons, evenness indicates whether metric values are spread evenly; and for between-scenario comparisons, shared value range indicates whether metrics use a consistent value range across scenarios. Our extensive experiments indicate that no single metric fulfills all three criteria perfectly. We therefore use methods from multi-criteria decision analysis to aggregate multiple metrics in a metrics suite, and we show that these metrics suites improve monotonicity compared to the best individual metric. This important result enables more monotonic, and thus more accurate, evaluations of new graph anonymization and de-anonymization algorithms.}

However, the transmission security of conventional schemes is lower than the fully encrypted transmission schemes because a substantial part of the recorded video remains unencrypted including significant metadata for decoding recorded video. In order to address this limitation, we propose a secure video transmission framework that selectively encrypts video metadata and frames on a per packet basis with a consideration of currently available computing power and transmission distance. Evaluation on a testbed demonstrates that the proposed framework provides enhanced video transmission security with less than half of the battery power consumption required by the fully encrypted transmission scheme.}

As the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) continues to increase in compute applications, including High Performance Computing (HPC) and safety-critical applications, so do the number of transient faults in GPUs. However, our understanding of the potential impact of transient fault propagation in GPU applications remains limited. This study shows that the resilience characteristics of GPU programs change significantly during program execution and these characteristics show repetitive, time-varying behavior. Interestingly, these repetitive, time-varying, resilience characteristics of GPU programs do not align or correlate well with the performance phases of GPU programs. Furthermore, this work discovers and validates that temporal changes in the vulnerability behavior during a kernel execution tends to coincide with changes in basic block execution paths. Finally, we demonstrate how these observations can be exploited to accelerate the fault injection campaigns for reliability assessment of GPU programs by an order of magnitude and open opportunities for designing other effective resilience mitigation strategies.}

Behavior-based methods are recognized as a promising method for online payment fraud detection. However, it is a big challenge to build high-resolution behavioral models by using low-quality behavioral data. In this work, we mainly address this problem from data enhancement for behavioral modeling. We extract fine-grained co-occurrence relationships of transactional attributes by using a knowledge graph. Furthermore, we adopt the heterogeneous network embedding to learn and improve representing comprehensive relationships. Particularly, we explore customized network embedding schemes for different types of behavioral models, such as the population-level models, individual-level models, and generalized-agent-based models. The performance gain of our method is validated by the experiments over the real dataset from a commercial bank. It can help representative behavioral models improve significantly the performance of online banking payment fraud detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to realize data enhancement for diversified behavior models by implementing network embedding algorithms on attribute-level co-occurrence relationships.}

To address this issue, a hidden policy needs to be applied to the CP-ABE scheme, as the identity of a user cannot be accurately confirmed when the decryption key is leaked, so the malicious user is traced and revoked as demanded. In this article, a CP-ABE scheme that realizes revocation, white-box traceability, and the application of hidden policy is proposed, and such ciphertext is composed of two parts. One is related to the access policy encrypted by the attribute value, and only the attribute name is evident in the access policy. Another is related to the revocation information and updated when revoking, where the revocation information is generated by the binary tree related to users. The leaf node value of a binary tree in the decryption key is used to trace the malicious user. From experimental results, it is shown that the proposed scheme is proven to be IND-CPA secure under the chosen plaintext attacks and selective access policy based on the decisional q-BDHE assumption in the standard model, efficient, and promising.}

Current DDoS attack protection services filter out the DDoS attack packets in the middle of the path from the attacker to the servers. Some of the DDoS protection systems filter them out at the victim server. As a result, unnecessary attack traffic congests the network and wastes bandwidth. This can be minimized if we block them as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack protection system by using the filter router. The victim needs to wisely select and send filters to a subset of filter routers to minimize attack traffic and blockage of legitimate users (LUs). Many filters can easily minimize the attack traffic and blockage of LUs, but it is costly to the victim. So, we formulate two problems with different settings for selecting filter routers given a constraint on the number of filters. We propose dynamic programming solutions for both problems. Both problems consider the blockage of all attack traffic before it reaches the victim. We conduct extensive simulation to support our solutions.}

Existing problem in two-phase detection is that after the first phase produces borderline decision, suspicious behaviors are not well contained before the second phase completes. This article improves Chameleon , a framework to realize the uncertain environment. Chameleon offers two environments: standard—for software identified as benign by the first phase, and uncertain—for software received borderline classification from the first phase. The uncertain environment adds obstacles to software execution through random perturbations applied probabilistically. We introduce a dynamic perturbation threshold that can target malware disproportionately more than benign software. We analyzed the effects of the uncertain environment by manually studying 113 software and 100 malware, and found that 92 percent malware and 10 percent benign software disrupted during execution. The results were then corroborated by an extended dataset (5,679 Linux malware samples) on a newer system. Finally, a careful inspection of the benign software crashes revealed some software bugs, highlighting Chameleon 's potential as a practical complementary anti-malware solution.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication as direct communication technology has many application scenarios and plays a very important role in the fifth-generation (5G) era. Using D2D communication in third generation partnership project (3GPP) 5G Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) can effectively relieve the network traffic pressure and reduce the energy consumption of the base station. However, there are numerous security threats in D2D applications since the D2D communication remains in the early stage. The existing standards and solutions rarely consider device discovery, efficient authentication, mutual authentication, and key negotiation with privacy protection for D2D user equipment (UE) in heterogeneous access scenarios. In this article, we present a unified efficient anonymity proximity device discovery and batch authentication mechanism for heterogeneous D2D UEs based on a new proposed efficient pairing-free certificateless batch signature (CLBS), the identity-based prefix encryption and Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Our proposed scheme can be applied to all the 5G heterogeneous access scenarios of D2D communication. The security analysis and performance results show that our scheme can achieve mutual authentication, key agreement, identity privacy protection, batch verification, and resist several protocol attacks with ideal efficiency.}

	abstract = {In the era of cloud computing, to achieve convenient location-based service (LBS), consumers such as users, companies, and organizations prefer subcontracting massive geographical data to public clouds after encryption for privacy and security. However, numerous harmful cyber-attacks happen on those public clouds in an unpredicted and hourly manner. To alleviate those concerns, various secure query schemes on the encrypted data have been proposed in the literature. As a fundamental query of LBSs, forward-secure range query has not been well investigated. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight and forward-secure range query (LS-RQ) on geographically encrypted data, which soundly balances between security and efficiency. Promisingly, we design an index mechanism to manage geographical data on the public clouds, while not compromising the privacy of data. Moreover, our LS-RQ schemes provide a convenient approach to range query on geographically encrypted data on-the-fly. We also rigorously prove that LS-RQ is forward-secure. Finally, extensive experimental studies are performed on both real and synthetic datasets. By observation, our LS-RQ schemes are highly efficient in realistic environments. Particularly, on encrypted datasets with about 1000000 geographical data, our solution to secure range query takes strictly less than a second.}

These malware propagate by scanning the Internet for vulnerable, exploitable IoT devices that could be utilized for further malicious activities. In this article, we devise a multi-level methodology to investigate Internet-scale reconnaissance activities generated by infected IoT devices. We leverage the Shodan IoT search engine and over 6TB of passive network traffic from a large network telescope (darknet) to infer compromised IoT devices and characterize the generated scanning campaigns. The results highlight a distinctive characteristic of IoT malware/botnets, represented by the targeted ports/services over the analysis interval. Furthermore, while these ports/services are mainly associated with well-known IoT malware/botnets (e.g., Mirai and Satori), we uncovered newly targeted ports, which indicate emerging IoT malware/botnet. Finally, by comparing two instances of analyzed IoT-generated scanning campaigns, we highlight the persistence and evolution of IoT malware/botnets (e.g., ADB.Miner and Fbot), which exploit existing, and in some cases, possibly new vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {A physical unclonable function (PUF) generates hardware intrinsic volatile secrets by exploiting uncontrollable manufacturing randomness. Although PUFs provide the potential for lightweight and secure authentication for increasing numbers of low-end Internet of Things devices, practical and secure mechanisms remain elusive. We aim to explore simulatable PUFs (SimPUFs) that are physically unclonable but efficiently modeled mathematically through privileged one-time PUF access to address the above problem. Given a challenge, a securely stored SimPUF in possession of a trusted server computes the corresponding response and its bit-specific reliability. Consequently, naturally noisy PUF responses generated by a resource limited prover can be immediately processed by a one-way function (OWF) and transmitted to the server, because the resourceful server can exploit the SimPUF to perform a trial-and-error search over likely error patterns to recover the noisy response to authenticate the prover. Security of trial-and-error reverse (TREVERSE) authentication under the random oracle model is guaranteed by the hardness of inverting the OWF. We formally evaluate the TREVERSE authentication capability with two SimPUFs experimentally derived from popular silicon PUFs.}

	abstract = {A major cause of security incidents such as cyber attacks is rooted in software vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities should ideally be found and fixed before the code gets deployed. Machine learning-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in capturing vulnerabilities. These methods are predominantly supervised. Their prediction models are trained on a set of ground truth data where the training data and test data are assumed to be drawn from the same probability distribution. However, in practice, the test data often differs from the training data in terms of distribution because they are from different projects or they differ in the types of vulnerability. In this article, we present a new system for Cross Domain Software Vulnerability Discovery (CD-VulD) using deep learning (DL) and domain adaptation (DA). We employ DL because it has the capacity of automatically constructing high-level abstract feature representations of programs, which are likely of more cross-domain useful than the handcrafted features driven by domain knowledge. The divergence between distributions is reduced by learning cross-domain representations. First, given software program representations, CD-VulD converts them into token sequences and learns the token embeddings for generalization across tokens. Next, CD-VulD employs a deep feature model to build abstract high-level presentations based on those sequences. Then, the metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) technique is employed to learn cross-domain representations by minimizing the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain. Finally, the cross-domain representations are used to build a classifier for vulnerability detection. Experimental results show that CD-VulD outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by a wide margin. We make the new datasets publicly available so that our work is replicable and can be further improved.}

	abstract = {In this article, we introduce a new mechanism for constructing multi-client searchable encryption (SE). By tactfully leveraging the RSA-function, we propose the first multi-client SE protocol that successfully avoids per-query interaction between data owner and client. Therefore, our approach significantly reduces the communication cost by eliminating the need for data owner to authorize client queries at all times. To be compatible with the RSA-based approach, we also present a deterministic and memory-efficient ‘keyword to prime’ hash function, which may be of independent interest. Further, to improve efficiency, we put forward a more generic construction from set-constrained PRFs. The construction not only inherits the merits of our first protocol, but also achieves an enhanced security (against untrusted clients), where colluding attack among clients is also taken into account. Both protocols are instantiated via the recent representative SE protocol by Cash et al. with the support of boolean queries. At last, we implement our proposed protocols and comprehensively evaluate their performance to demonstrate their practicability and scalability.}

	abstract = {There have been several public demonstrations of attacks on connected vehicles showing the ability of an attacker to take control of a targeted vehicle by injecting messages into their Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. In this article, using injected speed reading and Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) reading messages in in-motion vehicle, we examine the ability of the Pearson correlation and the unsupervised learning methods k-means clustering and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to differentiate ’no-attack’ and ’under-attack’ states of the given vehicle. We found that the Pearson correlation distinguishes the two states, the k-means clustering method has an acceptable accuracy but high false positive rate and HMM detects attacks with acceptable detection rate but has a high false positive in detecting attacks from speed readings when there is no attack. The accuracy of these unsupervised learning methods are comparable to the ones of the supervised learning methods used by CAN bus Intrusion Detection System (IDS) suppliers. In addition, the article shows that studying CAN anomaly detection techniques using off-vehicle test facilities may not properly evaluate the performance of the detection techniques. The results suggest using other features besides the data content of the CAN messages and integrate knowledge about how the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) collaborate in building effective techniques for the detection of injection of fabricated message attacks.}

Current specifications satisfy one of these requirements or the other, but not both. A Metagraph is a generalized graph-theoretic structure that overcomes this limitation. They are a natural way of expressing high-level end-to-end network policies. The rich formal foundations provided by metagraph algebra help analyze important network-policy properties such as reachability, redundancy and consistency. These features make metagraphs a clear choice for modeling and reasoning about policies in Formally-Verifiable Policy-Defined Networking (FV-PDN): a network-programming paradigm which has verifiability built-in. In this article, we demonstrate the use of metagraphs in policy specification by modeling and analyzing real policies from a large university network. We show their benefit in FV-PDN by developing a prototype solution which automatically refines metagraph-based high-level policies to device configurations and deploys them to an SDN-based emulated network.}

However, most systems are not designed for modern high-speed network links. In the field of network monitoring, an alternative solution has become the choice for such high-speed networks. Flow-monitoring, typically based on the Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) standard, now goes well beyond collecting statistical information about network connections. Current solutions are even able to include selected parts of the payload in these Flows to be used in conjunction with NIDS. Recently, we extended this concept to application layer HTTP Flows. We now present our improved version of the IPFIX-based Signature-based Intrusion Detection System (FIXIDS). Fixids makes use of HTTP intrusion detection signatures from the popular Snort system and applies them to incoming IPFIX-conforming HTTP Flows. Our evaluation shows that Fixids can deal with four times higher network data rates without drops compared to Snort, while maintaining the same event detection rate. Furthermore, a substantial part of the data traffic can be outsourced to Fixids so that Snort can be relieved of a significant portion of rules and traffic. This increases both the detection rate and the data rate the overall security appliance can handle.}

	abstract = {Despite decades of intensive research, it is still challenging to design a practical multi-factor user authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This is because protocol designers are confronted with a long-standing “security versus efficiency” dilemma: sensor nodes are lightweight devices with limited storage and computation capabilities, while the security requirements are demanding as WSNs are generally deployed for sensitive applications. Hundreds of proposals have been proposed, yet most of them have been found to be problematic, and the same mistakes are repeated again and again. Two of the most common security failures are regarding smart card loss attacks and node capture attacks. The former has been extensively investigated in the literature, while little attention has been given to understanding the node capture attacks. To alleviate this undesirable situation, this article takes a substantial step towards systematically exploring node capture attacks against multi-factor user authentication schemes for WSNs. We first investigate the various causes and consequences of node capture attacks, and classify them into ten different types in terms of the attack targets, adversary’s capabilities and vulnerabilities exploited. Then, we elaborate on each type of attack through examining 11 typical vulnerable protocols, and suggest corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we conduct a large-scale comparative measurement of 61 representative user authentication schemes for WSNs under our extended evaluation criteria. We believe that such a systematic understanding of node capture attacks would help design secure user authentication schemes for WSNs.}

Such changes may be due to software/hardware attacks and altered processors. Since control system processes are periodic computations, the thermal side channels exhibit a temporal pattern. This enables the detection of altered code and changed device characteristics. We present a machine learning approach to estimate the activity of the embedded device from the time sequence of thermal images and show that deviations from expected behavior can be detected. The approach is validated on a multi-core processor running a periodic computational code. The infrared imager collects thermal imagery from the processor, which is cooled from the backside. Instead of an external imager, one can deploy a finite number of on-chip temperature sensors. This article shows that integrating on-chip temperature sensors allows robust real-time monitoring of the processor behavior. Finally, we offer a machine learning approach to optimally place the on-chip sensors to aid detection.}

	abstract = {To provide fast traffic recovery upon failures, most modern networks support static Fast Rerouting (FRR) mechanisms for mission critical services. However, configuring FRR mechanisms to tolerate multiplefailures poses challenging algorithmic problems. While state-of-the-art solutions leveraging arc-disjoint arborescence-based network decompositions ensure that failover routes always reach their destinations eventually, even under multiple concurrent failures, these routes may be long and introduce unnecessary loads; moreover, they are tailored to worst-case failure scenarios. This article presents an algorithmic framework for improving a given FRR network decomposition, using postprocessing. In particular, our framework is based on iterative arc swapping strategies and supports a number of use cases, from strengthening the resilience (e.g., in the presence of shared risk link groups) to improving the quality of the resulting routes (e.g., reducing route lengths and induced loads). Our simulations show that postprocessing is indeed beneficial in various scenarios, and can therefore enhance today’s approaches.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused serious security threats and financial losses worldwide. Various real-time detection mechanisms that combine context information and provenance graphs have been proposed to defend against APT attacks. However, existing real-time APT detection mechanisms suffer from accuracy and efficiency issues due to inaccurate detection models and the growing size of provenance graphs. To address the accuracy issue, we propose a novel and accurate APT detection model that removes unnecessary phases and focuses on the remaining ones with improved definitions. To address the efficiency issue, we propose a state-based framework in which events are consumed as streams and each entity is represented in an FSA-like structure without storing historic data. Additionally, we reconstruct attack scenarios by storing just one in a thousand events in a database. Finally, we implement our design, called Conan , on Windows and conduct comprehensive experiments under real-world scenarios to show that Conan can accurately and efficiently detect all attacks within our evaluation. The memory usage and CPU efficiency of Conan remain constant over time (1-10 MB of memory and hundreds of times faster than data generation), making Conan a practical design for detecting both known and unknown APT attacks in real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {An important motivation for research in location privacy has been to protect against user profiling, i.e., inferring a user’s political affiliation, wealth level, sexual preferences, religious beliefs, and other sensitive attributes. Existing approaches focus on distorting or suppressing individual locations, but we argue that, for directly protecting against profiling, it is more appropriate to focus on the frequency with which various locations are visited – in other words, the histogram of a user’s locations. We introduce and explore a new privacy notion, namely, on-the-fly privacy for location histograms, in which a mobile user repeatedly submits obfuscated locations to a Location-Based Service aiming for the resulting histogram to resemble a target profile or differ from it. For example, she may want to avoid looking wealthy or to resemble a health-conscious person. We describe how to design concrete privacy mechanisms that operate under different assumptions on, e.g., the user’s mobility, including provably optimal mechanisms. We use a mobility dataset with 1083 users to illustrate how these mechanisms achieve privacy while minimizing the quality loss caused by the location obfuscation, in the context of two types of Location-Based Services: nearest-PoI, and geofence.}

In this article, we improve the performance of secure computation of these string metrics without sacrificing security, generality, composability, and accuracy. We explore a new design methodology that allows us to reduce the asymptotic cost by a factor of\nO(logn)\n(where\nn\ndenotes the input string length).

	abstract = {Cloud storage as one of the most important services of cloud computing which significantly facilitates cloud users to outsource their data to the cloud for storage and share them with authorized users. In cloud storage, secure deduplication has been widely investigated as it can eliminate the redundancy over the encrypted data to reduce storage space and communication overhead. Regarding the security and privacy, many existing secure deduplication schemes generally focus on achieving the following properties: data confidentiality, tag consistency, access control, and resistance to brute-force attacks. However, as far as we know, none of them can achieve these four requirements at the same time. To overcome this shortcoming, in this article, we propose an efficient secure deduplication scheme that supports user-defined access control. Specifically, by allowing only the cloud service provider to authorize data access on behalf of data owners, our scheme can maximally eliminate duplicates without violating the security and privacy of cloud users. Detailed security analysis shows that our authorized secure deduplication scheme achieves data confidentiality and tag consistency while resisting brute-force attacks. Furthermore, extensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the existing competing schemes, in terms of computational, communication and storage overheads as well as the effectiveness of deduplication.}

	abstract = {System services and resources in Android are accessed through IPC-based mechanisms. Previous research has demonstrated that they are vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack (DoS attack). For instance, the JNI global reference (JGR), which is widely used by system services, can be exhausted to cause the system reboot (hence the name JGRE attack). Even though the Android team tries to fix the problem by enforcing security checks, we find that it is still possible to construct a JGR exhaustion DoS attack in the latest Android system. In this article, we propose a new JGR exhaustion DoS attack, which is effective in different Android versions, including the latest one (i.e., Android 10). Specifically, we developed JGREAnalyzer, a tool that can systematically detect JGR vulnerable services APIs via a call graph analysis and a forwarding reachability analysis. We applied this tool to different Android versions and found multiple vulnerabilities. In particular, among 148 system services in Android 10, 12 of them have 21 vulnerabilities. Among them, 9 can be successfully exploited without any permissions. We further analyze the root cause of the vulnerabilities and propose a new defense to mitigate the JGRE attack by restricting resource consumption via global reference counting.}

However, it makes a user's online accounts vulnerable to a single point of failure when the registered email account is compromised. While previous research focuses on strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based password recovery has not yet been well studied. In this article, we first conduct a measurement study to characterize the password recovery activities in the wild. Specifically, we examine the authentication and password recovery protocols from 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them use emails for password recovery. We further scrutinize the security policy of leading email service providers and show that a significant portion of them takes no or marginal effort to protect user email accounts, leaving compromised email accounts readily available for mounting password recovery attacks. Then, we conduct case studies to assess potential losses caused by such attacks. Finally, we propose and implement a lightweight email security enhancement called Secure Email Account Recovery (SEAR) to defend against password recovery attacks by adding an extra layer of protection to password recovery emails.}

	abstract = {Under the assumption of honest-but-curious cloud service provider, various cryptographic techniques have been used to address the issues of data access control and confidentiality in public cloud storage. Among which, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been shown to be an attractive scheme. Although the technique of ABE brings in various benefits, its onerous overhead should not be ignored. In this article, based on an improved LSSS (linear secret sharing scheme) matrix expression integrated in CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) algorithm, we present an efficient and secure attribute-based access control scheme for the scenarios where multiple data are shared and encrypted with frequently used sub-policies. In the scheme, a user can store the parameters about a specific sub-policy in his/her first decryption, which can be reused in the subsequent data decryptions whose embedded access policies include the same sub-policy so as to significantly reduce the computation cost. Our proposed scheme is proved to be semantically secure under chosen plaintext attacks and can well preserve the confidentiality of the data sharing system. Our analysis and experimentation also show that our scheme does significantly reduce the decryption time and while trades in only very little storage overhead, and thus effectively promotes the efficiency.}

Most recently, a new RingCT protocol (called RingCT 2.0) was proposed by leveraging cryptographic accumulators, which can achieve a constant-size output theoretically but still far from being practical due to the heavy zero-knowledge associated with the accumulator. In this article, we revisit the design of ring confidential transaction protocol and put forward a more efficient privacy-preserving payment protocol, which is built upon an extended version of one-out-of-many proof and a special multi-signature. Compared with previous works, the new protocol is not only more practical, but also does not suffer from a trusted setup. Besides, we show that the protocol satisfies the security requirements provided that the underlying cryptographic primitives are secure in the random oracle model. We implement our new payment protocol in Java, and the experimental results show that it is efficient enough to be used in practice.}

	abstract = {In the energy sector, IoT manifests in the form of next-generation power grids that provide enhanced electrical stability, efficient power distribution, and utilization. The primary feature of a Smart Grid is the presence of an advanced bi-directional communication network between the Smart meters at the consumer end and the servers at the Utility Operators. Smart meters are broadly vulnerable to attacks on communication and physical systems. We propose a secure and operationally asymmetric mutual authentication and key-exchange protocol for secure communication. Our protocol balances security and efficiency, delegates complex cryptographic operations to the resource-equipped servers, and carefully manages the workload on the resource-constrained Smart meter nodes using unconventional lightweight primitives such as Physically Unclonable Functions. We prove the security of the protocol using well-established cryptographic assumptions. We implement the proposed scheme end-to-end in a Smart meter prototype using commercial-off-the-shelf products, a Utility server, and a credential generator as the trusted third party. Additionally, we demonstrate a physics-based attack named load modification attack on the Smart meter to demonstrate that merely securing the communication channel using authentication does not secure the meter, but requires further protections to ensure the correctness of the reported consumption. Hence, we propose a countermeasure to such an attack that goes side-by-side with our protocol implementation.}

However, recent security incidents indicate that CAs may (be compromised to) sign fraudulent certificates. In this article, we propose blockchain-based certificate transparency (CT) and revocation transparency (RT) to balance the absolute authority of CAs. Our scheme is compatible with X.509 PKIs but significantly reinforces the security guarantees of a certificate. The CA-signed certificates and their revocation status information of an SSL/TLS web server are published by the subject (i.e., the web server) as a transaction in the global certificate blockchain. The certificate blockchain acts as append-only public logs to monitor CAs’ certificate signing and revocation operations, and an SSL/TLS web server is granted with the cooperative control on its certificates. A browser compares the certificate received in SSL/TLS negotiations with the ones in the public certificate blockchain, and accepts it only if it is published and not revoked. We implement the prototype system with Firefox and Nginx, and the experimental results show that it introduces reasonable overheads.}

Our constructions are the first to provide forward/backward security in the context of SSE-based schemes supporting geometric range search. Besides, we define a security notion called content privacy. This security notion captures the leakages that are critical in the context of geometric range search but not considered by forward/backward security. Content privacy eliminates the leakage on the updated points of the database during both search and update. Due to the inherent leakages associated with range queries, none of the existing related works can support content privacy, whereas the design of our constructions avoids such leakages. When compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, our constructions provide a higher level of security and practical efficiency supported by our experimental results.}

	abstract = {As cybercrimes grow in scale with devastating economic costs, it is important to protect potential victims against diverse attacks. In spite of the diversity of cybercrimes, it is the uniform resource locators (URLs) that connect vulnerable users with potential attacks. Although numerous solutions (e.g., rule-based solutions and machine learning-based methods) are proposed for malicious URL detection, they cannot provide robust performance due to the diversity of cybercrimes and cannot cope with the explosive growth of malicious URLs with the evolution of obfuscation strategies. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based system, dubbed as CyberLen , to detect malicious URLs robustly and effectively. Specifically, we use factorization machine (FM) to learn the latent interaction among lexical features. For the deep structural features, position embedding is introduced for token vectorization to reduce the ambiguity of URL tokens. Meanwhile, temporal convolution network (TCN) is utilized to learn the long-distance dependency among URL tokens. To fuse heterogeneous features, self-paced wide\n&\ndeep learning strategy is proposed to train a robust model effectively. The proposed solution is evaluated on a large-scale URL dataset. Our experimental results show that position embedding is constructive to reducing the ambiguity of URL tokens, and the self-paced wide\n&\ndeep learning strategy shows superior performance in terms of F1 score and convergence speed.}

	abstract = {Ideal cyber threat intelligence (CTI) includes insights into attacker strategies that are specific to a network under observation. Such CTI currently requires extensive expert input for obtaining, assessing, and correlating system vulnerabilities into a graphical representation, often referred to as an attack graph (AG). Instead of deriving AGs based on system vulnerabilities, this work advocates the direct use of intrusion alerts. We propose SAGE, an explainable sequence learning pipeline that automatically constructs AGs from intrusion alerts without a priori expert knowledge. SAGE exploits the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) — a model that brings infrequent severe alerts into the spotlight and summarizes paths leading to them. Attack graphs are extracted from the model on a per-victim, per-objective basis. SAGE is thoroughly evaluated on three open-source intrusion alert datasets collected through security testing competitions in order to analyze distributed multi-stage attacks. SAGE compresses over 330k alerts into 93 AGs that show how specific attacks transpired. The AGs are succinct, interpretable, and provide directly relevant insights into strategic differences and fingerprintable paths. They even show that attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one in 84.5% of the cases.}

	abstract = {Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information from an unsuspecting victim by malicious means. Recent studies have shown that phishers often use persuasion techniques to get positive responses from the recipients. Still missing from this literature are studies assessing effectiveness of persuasion cues in phishing email detection. Specifically focusing on gain and loss persuasion cues, we address the following research questions: In detecting phishing emails, (1) how effective are the gain persuasion cues, (2) how effective are the loss persuasion cues, and (3) how effective is an integrated model of gain and loss persuasion? In order to address the research questions, we create three machine learning models, with relevant gain persuasion cues, loss persuasion cues, and combined gain and loss persuasion cues respectively, and compare the estimates with a baseline model that does not account for the persuasion cues. The results show that the three phishing detection models with relevant persuasion cues significantly outperform the baseline model by approximately 5% to 20% percent in terms of F-score, thus representing reliable methods for phishing email detection. The objective of this study is to develop anti-phishing methods that utilize persuasion cues for detecting phishing emails. Such research is useful because a deeper understanding of persuasion cues can inform the design of effective countermeasures for detecting and blocking phishing emails.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threats (APT) have novel features such as long-term latency, precision strikes and uncertain strategies. APT poses severe threats to the resource-limited edge devices in advanced networks. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) conducts data analysis on attack strategies by artificial intelligence (AI) and generates threat intelligence to optimize the detection model and guide defense strategies. However, AI lacks explanations for the decisions and thus reduces the transparency and performance of the detection model. Besides, the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the computational resource limitation of edge devices needs an optimal and rapid dynamic resource allocation method, which edge game and AI can help. In this article, we propose an explainable intelligence-driven APT edge defense mechanism. The proposed mechanism provides guidelines and explanations for designing the defense strategy and resource allocation scheme of the edge defender to detect APT. The edge defense strategy model is based on edge Bayesian Stackelberg game and CTI. Meanwhile, we implement a DRL-based resource allocation scheme to meet rapid response requirements at the edges. We demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can improve the protection level of edges and defense capability against APT through extensive experiments.}

	abstract = {Cyber threats are one of the most pressing issues in the digital age. There has been a consensus on deploying a proactive defense to effectively detect and respond to adversary threats. The key to success is understanding the characteristics of malware, including their activities and manipulated resources on the target machines. The MITRE ATT&CK framework (ATT&CK), a popular source of open source intelligence (OSINT), provides rich information and knowledge about adversary lifecycles and attack behaviors. The main challenges of this study involve knowledge collection from ATT&CK, malicious behavior identification using deep learning, and the identification of associated API calls. A MITRE ATT&CK based Malicious Behavior Analysis system (MAMBA) for Windows malware is proposed, which incorporates ATT&CK knowledge and considers attentions on manipulated resources and malicious activities in the neural network model. To synchronize ATT&CK updates in a timely manner, knowledge collection can be an automatic and incremental process. Given these features, MAMBA achieves the best performance of malicious behavior discovery among all the compared learning-based methods and rule-based approaches on all datasets; it also yields a highly interpretable mapping from the discovered malicious behaviors to relevant ATT&CK techniques, as well as to the related API calls.}

	abstract = {Phishing website attack, as one of the most persistent forms of cyber threats, evolves and remains a major cyber threat. Various detection methods (e.g., lookup systems, fraud cue-based methods) have been proposed to identify phishing websites. The limitations of lookup systems (e.g., failing to address newly created attacks) and the fraud cue-based methods (e.g., relying on feature engineering) motivated the development of deep representation-based methods capable of learning deep fraud cues for enhanced anti-phishing capacity. Focusing mostly on URLs, these methods fail to analyze other two important modalities of website content: textual information and visual design. Moreover, the interpretability of these deep learning based methods is limited, reducing model trustworthiness and preventing relevant and actionable intelligence. As such, we propose a multi-modal hierarchical attention model (MMHAM) which jointly learns the deep fraud cues from the three major modalities of website content for phishing website detection. Specifically, MMHAM features an innovative shared dictionary learning approach for aligning representations from different modalities in the attention mechanism. In our evaluation experiments, the proposed MMHAM not only learned improved deep cues for enhanced phishing detection, but provided a hierarchical interpretability system from which we could develop phishing threat intelligence to inform phishing websites detection at different levels.}

	abstract = {Cheating in massive multiple online games (MMOGs) adversely affect the game’s popularity and reputation among its users. Therefore, game developers invest large amount of efforts to detect and prevent cheats that provide an unfair advantage to cheaters over other naive users during game play. Particularly, MMOG clients share data with the server during game play. Game developers leverage this data to detect cheating. However, detecting cheats is challenging mainly due to the limited client-side information, along with unknown and complex cheating techniques. In this article, we aim to leverage machine learning-based models to predict cheats over encrypted game traffic during game play. Concretely, network game traffic during game play from each player can be used to determine whether a cheat is employed. A major challenge in developing such a prediction model is the availability of sufficient training data, which is sparingly available in practice. Game traffic obtained from a few known players can be easily labeled. However, if such players are not a good representation of the population (i.e., other players), then a supervised model trained on labeled game traffic from these set of players may not generalize well for the population. Here, we propose a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based scalable transfer learning approach to overcome the constraints of limited labeled data. Our empirical evaluation on a popular MMOG demonstrates significant improvement in cheat prediction compared to other competing methods.}

	abstract = {The recent rise in complex Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, such as KRACK and Dragonslayer, indicates the critical need for effective Wi-Fi protocol testing tools. In this article, we conceptualize, design and implement a directed fuzzing methodology named Greyhound that automatically tests the Wi-Fi client implementations against vulnerabilities such as crashes or non-compliant behaviors. Leveraging a holistic Wi-Fi protocol model, Greyhound directs the fuzzer in specific states of target Wi-Fi client. By exchanging mutated packets with a Wi-Fi client, Greyhound aims to induce the client to exhibit anomalous behaviors that badly deviate from Wi-Fi protocols. We have implemented Greyhound and evaluated it on a variety of real-world Wi-Fi clients, including smartphone, Raspberry Pi, IoT device microcontrollers and a medical device. Our evaluation indicates that Greyhound not only automatically discovers known vulnerabilities (including KRACK and Dragonslayer) that would require specialized verification otherwise, but, more importantly, it also has uncovered four new vulnerabilities in popular Wi-Fi client devices. All discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by manufacturers and they have been assigned three different common vulnerability exposure (CVE) IDs. We also win a bug bounty of 2,200 USD for discovering the security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, our evaluation with three existing Wi-Fi fuzz testing tools reveals that all such tools fail to discover any of the vulnerabilities (including crashes) uncovered by Greyhound . Last but not the least, we have deployed Greyhound to test the Wi-Fi client implementation on automotive head units. Greyhound automatically discovers KRACK, Dragonslayer and other anomalies in these Wi-Fi implementations. Such a real world try-out justifies the necessity and efficacy of Greyhound .}

	abstract = {The rapid increase of recent privacy attacks has significantly decreased trust on behalf of the users. A root cause to these problems is that modern computer architectures have always been designed for performance, while security protections are traditionally addressed reactively. Practical security protections, such as Intel SGX, rely on processing unencrypted data in the architectural state, which leaves them exposed to software attacks (e.g., SGXpectre). This work revisits the traditional computation stack and introduces a novel computation paradigm, where data is never decrypted in the architectural state. Through our architecture, data are protected with symmetric or asymmetric encryption and the programmer manipulates them directly in the encrypted domain. To increase performance, we exploit data locality by introducing decryption caches in the microarchitectural state. Our proposal addresses all abstraction levels in the computation stack: from microarchitecture to library support for high-level programming. The proposed architecture is instantiated through new assembly instructions, registers and functional units operating on large integers. In our evaluation, we extend the OpenRISC 1000 architecture and develop open-source libraries for C++. As a case study, we employ data-oblivious benchmarks and observe that for benchmarks with high temporal locality, our architecture can achieve comparable performance to processing unencrypted data.}

	abstract = {To mitigate cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), the W3C group recommends web service providers to employ a computer security standard called Content Security Policy (CSP). However, less than 3.7 percent of real-world websites are equipped with CSP according to Google’s survey. The low scalability of CSP is incurred by the difficulty of deployment and non-compatibility for state-of-art browsers. To explore the scalability of CSP, in this article, we propose JavaScript based CSP (JSCSP), which is able to support most of real-world browsers but also to generate security policies automatically. Specifically, JSCSP offers a novel self-defined security policy which enforces essential confinements to related items, including JavaScript functions, DOM elements and data access. Meanwhile, JSCSP has an efficient algorithm to automatically generate the policy directives and enforce them in a cascading way, which is more fine-grained and practical than the functionalities provided by CSP. We further implement JSCSP on a Chrome extension, and our evaluation shows that the extension is compatible with popular JavaScript libraries. Our JSCSP extension can detect and block the tested attacking vectors extracted from the prevalent web applications. We state that JSCSP delivers better performance compared to other XSS defense solutions.}

With the emergence of new attacks, how to defend diverse malicious attacks for online recommendations is a challenging issue. Moreover, characterizing and evaluating sparse rating behaviors are a long-standing problem that still remains open, leading to an upsurge of research, as well as real application. This article investigates probabilistic inference and trustworthiness evaluation of behavioral links according to coupled association networks converted from rating behaviors, and presents a unified detection framework from a novel perspective to spot diverse malicious threats. First, an association graph is constructed from the original rating matrix based on both the inherent rating motivation of users and atomic propagation rules of coupled networks. Then, we evaluate the trustworthiness of link behaviors in the targeted network of coupled association network by exploiting a factor graph model of coupled network, and redetermine concerned links in the targeted network. Finally, suspicious users and items can be empirically inferred by comprehensively evaluating the trustworthiness of both links and nodes in the targeted network. Extensive experiments on synthetic data for profile injection attacks and co-visitation injection attacks, as well as real-world data including Amazon and TripAdvisor, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection approach compared with competing benchmarks.}

Specifically, a resourceful steganographer could embed a set of secret information into multiple images adaptively, and share these images in cloud storage with the receiver, instead of traditional single image steganography. Nevertheless, it is still an open issue how to allocate embedding payload among a sequence of images for security performance enhancement. This article formulates adaptive payload distribution in multiple images steganography based on image texture features and provides the theoretical security analysis from the steganalyst's point of view. Two payload distribution strategies based on image texture complexity and distortion distribution are designed and discussed, respectively. The proposed strategies can be employed together with these state-of-the-art single image steganographic algorithms. The comparisons of the security performance against the modern universal pooled steganalysis are given. Furthermore, this article compares the per image detectability of these multiple images steganographic schemes against the modern single image steganalyzer. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed payload distribution strategies could obtain better security performance.}

	abstract = {Coverage-guided fuzzing is one of the most effective solutions for vulnerability discovery. Among coverage-guided fuzzing, full-speed fuzzing, such as UnTracer, traces test cases only when they discover new coverage. Due to the high expense of tracing test cases, full-speed fuzzers improve the efficiency of fuzzing by tracing only coverage-increasing test cases. However, the existing full-speed fuzzer (i.e., UnTracer) is based on basic block coverage, suffering a severe problem called edge collision. Moreover, such fuzzers neglect the path frequency, which affects fuzzing effectiveness. In this article, we propose CSI-Fuzz, a fuzzer utilizing coverage sensitive instrumentation to address the problems of existing full-speed fuzzing. CSI-Fuzz directly instruments at edges, which solves the problem of edge collision. Meanwhile, CSI-Fuzz sets path identifiers to count the frequency of covered paths. Our CSI-Fuzz can be recognized as an add-on and seamlessly applied to existing coverage-guided fuzzers. We accordingly implement CSI-Fuzz based on two widely-adopted fuzzers, AFL and AFLFast, to evaluate its performance. The experiments demonstrate that CSI-Fuzz discovers more edges than AFL, AFLFast, and UnTracer. Additionally, CSI-Fuzz exposes more bugs than the other fuzzers.}

	abstract = {Malware attacks are a significant part of the new software security threats detected each year. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) are a set of hardware instructions introduced by Intel in their recent lines of processors that are intended to provide a secure execution environment for user-developed applications. To our knowledge, there was no serious attempt yet to overcome the SGX protection by exploiting the weaknesses in the software supply chain infrastructure, namely at the level of the development, build or signing servers. While SGX protection does not specifically take into consideration such threats, we show in the current article that a simple malware attack exploiting a separation between the build and signing processes can have a serious damaging impact, practically nullifying SGX integrity protection measures. We also explore two possible mitigations against the attack, one centralized leveraging SGX itself, and one distributed that relies on a smart contract deployed on a blockchain infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that both methods are feasible in practice and their added costs are acceptable for the offered protection.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage services give users a great facility in data management such as data collection, storage and sharing, but also bring some potential security hazards. An utmost importance is how to ensure the integrity of data files stored in the cloud, particular for user groups without trusted managers. Existing literature focuses on integrity checking for groups with managers who have lots of permissions. To overcome the shortage of public auditing for non-manager user groups in clouds, we develop a novel framework IPANM that integrates\n(t,n)\nthreshold technology, blinding technology, and incentive mechanism to realize an incentive privacy-preserving public auditing scheme. In IPANM, the data integrity is guaranteed by our\n(t,n)\nthreshold signature based public auditing and the data privacy during public auditing is protected by the blinding technology. The generation of signatures can be accelerated by our blockchain-aided incentive mechanism that mobilizes the initiative of signers in the signature generation by rewarding the contributed signers. We formally prove the security of our IPANM and conduct numerical analysis and evaluation study to validate its high efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that IPANM has lower overheads of storage, communication, and computation as compared to the state-of-the-art technique IAID-PDP and NPP.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples which contain human-imperceptible perturbations. A series of defending methods, either proactive defence or reactive defence, have been proposed in the recent years. However, most of the methods can only handle specific attacks. For example, proactive defending methods are invalid against grey-box or white-box attacks, while reactive defending methods are challenged by low-distortion adversarial examples or transferring adversarial examples. This becomes a critical problem since a defender usually does not have the type of attack as a priori knowledge. Moreover, existing two-pronged defences (e.g., MagNet), which take advantage of both proactive and reactive methods, have been reported as broken under transferring attacks. To address this problem, this article proposed a novel defensive framework based on collaborative multi-task training, aiming at providing defence for different types of attacks. The proposed defence first encodes training labels into label pairs and counters black-box attacks leveraging adversarial training supervised by the encoded label pairs. The defence further constructs a detector to identify and reject high-confidence adversarial examples that bypass the black-box defence. In addition, the proposed collaborative architecture can prevent adversaries from finding valid adversarial examples when the defence strategy is exposed. In the experiments, we evaluated our defence against four state-of-the-art attacks on\nMNIST\nand\nCIFAR10\ndatasets. The results showed that our defending method achieved up to 96.3 percent classification accuracy on black-box adversarial examples, and detected up to 98.7 percent of the high confidence adversarial examples. It only decreased the model accuracy on benign example classification by 2.1 percent for the\nCIFAR10\ndataset.}

	abstract = {Estimating the number of distinct elements is required in many computing applications. For example, we may want to estimate the number of unique users accessing a service, or the number of different words in a text. This problem is known as count distinct or cardinality estimate and has been widely studied. An accurate naïve approach is to keep a list of distinct elements and for each upcoming one check such list and add it when it is not found. However, this is not practical for large cardinalities because it would require storing a large number of elements. Over the years, many algorithms have been proposed to provide cardinality estimates without storing elements and using less memory. One of the state-of-the-art algorithms for cardinality estimate is the HyperLogLog (HLL); it provides a good estimate over a large range of cardinality values using a small array of counters. As HLL is implemented in computing systems, it is exposed to soft errors that can corrupt bits stored in memories or registers. To avoid data corruption, memories are commonly protected with Error Correction Codes (ECCs). ECCs however incur in significant overhead because protection needs additional memory cells per word to store the parity check bits as well as additional computation for checking them. For achieving data protection, an alternative approach that can be of low-overhead exploits features of the implemented algorithms to detect and correct errors. In other scenarios, the algorithm must be executed on a system that is not protected with parity or ECCs and thus protection must be implemented at the algorithmic level. In this article, we first study the impact of soft errors on the HLL algorithm by performing simulation by error injection. The results show that the algorithm is quite robust and can filter out most errors. However, for large cardinalities, there are some errors that can cause a large discrepancy in the HLL estimate. This occurs when the uppermost bit with a value of one in a counter is flipped to a zero. Based on the analysis of the experimental results and the HLL algorithm, a protection technique is proposed that effectively mitigates the impact of soft errors at a small overhead. The proposed Remove Minimum (RM) scheme has been validated by error injection experiments to show that it effectively protects against soft errors on the HLL counters.}

	abstract = {The existing models of reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) are based on single data-hider, where the original image cannot be reconstructed when the data-hider is damaged. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel model with multiple data-hiders for RDH-EI based on secret sharing. It divides the original image into multiple different encrypted images with the same size of the original image and distributes them to multiple different data-hiders for data hiding. Each data-hider can independently embed data into the encrypted image to obtain the corresponding marked encrypted image. The original image can be losslessly recovered by collecting sufficient marked encrypted images from undamaged data-hiders when individual data-hiders are subjected to potential damage. This further protects the security of the original image. We provide four cases of the proposed model, namely, two joint cases and two separable cases. From the proposed model, we derive a separable RDH-EI method with high-capacity. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

First, the original image are divided into the blocks of equal size and the prediction error of the original image is calculated. Then, the 8 bit-planes of prediction error are executed rearrangement and bit-stream compression, respectively.

	abstract = {This article first considers the research problem of fairness in collaborative deep learning, while ensuring privacy. A novel reputation system is proposed through digital tokens and local credibility to ensure fairness, in combination with differential privacy to guarantee privacy. In particular, we build a fair and differentially private decentralised deep learning framework called FDPDDL, which enables parties to derive more accurate local models in a fair and private manner by using our developed two-stage scheme: during the initialisation stage, artificial samples generated by Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (DPGAN) are used to mutually benchmark the local credibility of each party and generate initial tokens; during the update stage, Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) is used to facilitate collaborative privacy-preserving deep learning, and local credibility and tokens of each party are updated according to the quality and quantity of individually released gradients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets under three realistic settings demonstrate that FDPDDL achieves high fairness, yields comparable accuracy to the centralised and distributed frameworks, and delivers better accuracy than the standalone framework.}

	abstract = {According to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850-90-4, most smart grid substations are designed with redundancy in order to improve their availability in case of failures. Redundancy usually takes the form of having multiple subsystems with identical functionality based on the assumption that failures in one subsystem are isolated from other subsystems. However, this is not necessarily true in the case of failures caused by malicious attacks, because attackers can easily reuse their skills and tools across different subsystems under similar configurations. Taking this into consideration, this article introduces the factor of security (FoS) metrics to quantify the security effectiveness of redundant subsystems in smart grids. Specifically, we first apply the attack graph model to capture various threats in smart grids and substations; we then formally define the FoS metric and the probabilistic FoS metric, and finally we evaluate those metrics through simulations.}

	abstract = {Cloud-based data storage service has drawn increasing interests from both academic and industry in the recent years due to its efficient and low cost management. Since it provides services in an open network, it is urgent for service providers to make use of secure data storage and sharing mechanism to ensure data confidentiality and service user privacy. To protect sensitive data from being compromised, the most widely used method is encryption. However, simply encrypting data (e.g., via AES) cannot fully address the practical need of data management. Besides, an effective access control over download request also needs to be considered so that Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks cannot be launched to hinder users from enjoying service. In this article, we consider the dual access control , in the context of cloud-based storage, in the sense that we design a control mechanism over both data access and download request without loss of security and efficiency. Two dual access control systems are designed in this article, where each of them is for a distinct designed setting. The security and experimental analysis for the systems are also presented.}

	abstract = {Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) bring a unique challenge to the security community, namely persistent security. As NVM-based memories are expected to restore their data after recovery, the security metadata must be recovered as well. However, persisting all affected security metadata on each memory write would significantly degrade performance and exacerbate the write endurance problem. On the other hand, relying on an encryption counters recovery scheme would take hours to rebuild the integrity tree, and will not be sufficient to rebuild the Tree-of-Counters (ToC). Due to intermediate nodes dependencies it is not possible to recover this type of trees using the encryption counters. To ensure recoverability, all updates to the security metadata must be persisted, which can be tens of additional writes on each write. In this article, we propose Phoenix, a practical novel scheme which relies on elegantly reproducing the cache content before a crash, however with minimal overheads. Our evaluation results show that Phoenix reduces persisting security metadata overhead writes to 3.8 percent less than a write-back encrypted system without recovery, thus improving the NVM lifetime by 8x. Overall Phoenix performance is better than the baseline.}

Many cryptographic tools have been introduced to preserve data confidentiality against the untrustworthy network and cloud servers. However, how to efficiently identify and retrieve useful data from a large number of ciphertexts without a costly decryption mechanism remains a challenging problem. In this article, we introduce a cloud-fog-device data sharing system (CFDS) with data confidentiality and data source identification simultaneously based on a new cryptographic primitive named matchmaking attribute-based encryption (MABE) by extending matchmaking encryption in CRYPTO’19. Our solution offers a secure fine-grained bilateral access control that includes (1) fine-grained sender access control, (2) fine-grained receiver access control, (3) sender privacy, and (4) performance optimization via outsourcing data source identification to fog nodes. We give the formal definition and security models of MABE, and present a concrete construction with formal security proofs. We also offer a detailed security analysis of our proposed CFDS against real-world security threats. The extensive comparison and experimental simulation demonstrate that, by immigrating heavy workload to fog nodes, our scheme has better functionalities and performances than the most related solutions.}

	abstract = {Set similarity search, aiming to search the similar sets to a query set, has wide application in today's recommendation services. Meanwhile, the rapid advance in cloud technique has promoted the boom of data outsourcing. However, since the cloud is not fully trustable and the data may be sensitive, data should be encrypted before outsourced to the cloud. Undoubtedly, data encryption will hinder some basic functionalities, e.g., set similarity search. For achieving set similarity search over encrypted data, many solutions were proposed, yet they either only satisfy weak security requirements, or only achieve approximate similarity, or have low efficiency or under the model of two cloud servers. Therefore, in this article, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving exact set similarity search scheme under a single cloud server. Specifically, we first design a symmetric-key predicate encryption (SPE-Sim) scheme, which can support similarity search over binary vectors. Then, we represent the set records to be binary vectors and employ the B+ tree to build an index for them. After that, based on SPE-Sim and the B+ tree-based index, we propose our scheme and it can achieve efficient set similarity search while preserving the privacy of set records and query contents. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that our scheme is privacy-preserving and efficient.}

	abstract = {This article concerns the problem of detecting the use of information hiding at the physical layer in wireless communications because they are harder to be detected than other layer-based information hiding schemes. Prior schemes for detecting physical layer based information hiding are either heuristic based or machine learning based. The key limitation of prior heuristics based information hiding detection schemes is that they do not answer the fundamental question of why the information hidden at the physical layer can be detected. The key limitation of prior machine learning based information hiding detection schemes is that they lack robustness because wireless signals at the physical layer are very much environmental dependent, and thus an information hiding detection scheme trained in one environment often does not work well in another environment. Our insight is that embedding information on wireless signals at the physical layer will inevitably have a negative impact on the decodability of the cover signals, such as the increase of the error probability at the receiver (as well as the monitor). Based on the above insight, in our approach, after the monitor demodulates and decodes the cover signals, it will re-encode and re-modulate the cover signals, and then compare the resulting recovered signals with the raw signals that it received from the sender. We further propose a new estimation scheme for calculating receiver noise variance and conducted theoretical analysis. Specifically, we propose two hidden information detection schemes, a noise grouped based detection scheme and a constellation distance based detection scheme, both taking estimation errors into consideration. In particular, our constellation distance based detection scheme is the first scheme that can pinpoint the exact location on the received signals that are embedded with hidden information. We implemented our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparison between our schemes and prior schemes. Our experimental results show that when the received SNR is more than 20 dB, our approach with the new estimation scheme has the probability of detection more than 0.95, and our constellation distance based detection scheme can correctly pinpoint all embedded locations.}

	abstract = {To improve data availability and durability, cloud users would like to store multiple copies of their original files at servers. The multi-copy auditing technique is proposed to provide users with the assurance that multiple copies are actually stored in the cloud. However, most multi-replica solutions rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which entails massive overhead of certificate computation and management. In this article, we propose an efficient multi-copy dynamic integrity auditing scheme by employing certificateless signatures (named MDSS), which gets rid of expensive certificate management overhead and avoids the key escrow problem in identity-based signatures. Specifically, we improve the classic Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) to achieve batch updates for multi-copy storage, which allows the communication overhead incurred for dynamics to be independent of the replica number. To meet the flexible storage requirement, we propose a variable replica number storage strategy, allowing users to determine the replica number for each block. Based on the fact that auditors may frame Cloud Storage Servers (CSSs), we use signature verification to prevent malicious auditors from framing honest CSSs. Finally, security analysis proves that our proposal is secure in the random oracle model. Analysis and simulation results show that our proposal is more efficient than current state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Traffic-sensitive navigation systems in vehicular networks help drivers avoid traffic jams by providing several realtime navigation routes. However, drivers still encounter privacy concerns because their sensitive locations, i.e., their start point and endpoint, are submitted to an honest-but-curious navigation service provider (NSP). Previous privacy-preserving studies exhibit serious deficiencies under similar queries : if a driver makes several similar queries, i.e., periodically makes requests for the same start point and endpoint to the NSP, these requests will eventually reveal the areas of the two points as well as the route. In this article, we present a novel privacy-preserving navigation scheme PiSim, which supports similar queries in navigation services. Intuitively, we transform the typical navigation approach into a traffic congestion querying approach. Instead of sending two locations to the NSP and awaiting a navigation route, drivers query the traffic congestion along the navigation route. Specifically, PiSim is characterized by extending anonymous authentication, facilitating privacy-preserving multi-keyword fuzzy search, and constructing weighted proximity graphs. Our scheme protects location privacy and route privacy, and defends against multiple requesting, spurious reporting, and collusion attacks from malicious drivers. Finally, a detailed analysis confirms the privacy and security properties of PiSim. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility, performance, and privacy protection level.}

	abstract = {A novel slow-aging solution named SDAC is proposed to address the model aging problem in Android malware detection, which is due to the lack of adapting to the changes in Android specifications during malware detection. Different from periodic retraining of detection models in existing solutions, SDAC evolves effectively by evaluating new APIs’ contributions to malware detection according to existing API’s contributions. In SDAC, the contributions of APIs are evaluated by their contexts in the API call sequences extracted from Android apps. A neural network is applied on the sequences to assign APIs to vectors, among which the differences of API vectors are regarded as the semantic distances. SDAC then clusters all APIs based on their semantic distances to create a feature set in the training phase, and extends the feature set to include all new APIs in the detecting phase. Without being trained by any new set of real-labelled apps, SDAC can adapt to the changes in Android specifications by simply identifying new APIs appearing in the detection phase. In extensive experiments with datasets dated from 2011 to 2016, SDAC achieves a significantly higher accuracy and a significantly slower aging speed compared with MaMaDroid, a state-of-the-art Android malware detection solution which maintains resilience to API changes.}

	abstract = {Recently, reconstruction attacks on static encrypted database supporting range queries have been proposed. However, attacks on encrypted database within two updates in the similar setting have not been studied extensively. As far as we know, the only work is the update recovery attack presented by Grubbs et al. (CCS 2018). Following their seminal work, we present new update recovery attacks for dense dataset (i.e., at least one record corresponding to each value in the range), which enable a deeper understanding of the impact caused by leakages due to updates on dynamic encrypted database. Our first attack aims at recovering the value of a newly added record in the case of one database update. We further demonstrate that the attack can fully reconstruct the database counts if the updated value is either the minimum or maximum in the range. We then consider a setting where two distinct records are added separately, which leads to our second attack. We next extend our attacks to the setting where the update operation is deletion. To the best of our knowledge, update recovery attack on database supporting deletion has not been considered before. We demonstrate practicality of our attack via extensive simulations using real dataset.}

With a smaller number of known exploited vulnerabilities compared with the total number of vulnerabilities, it is more difficult to model and predict when a vulnerability with a known exploit will be reported. In this article, we introduce an approach for predicting the discovery pattern of publically known exploited vulnerabilities using all publically known vulnerabilities reported for a given software. Eight commonly used vulnerability discovery models (VDMs) and one neural network model (NNM) were utilized to evaluate the prediction capability of our approach. We compared their predictions results with the scenario when only exploited vulnerabilities were used for prediction. Our results show that, in terms of prediction accuracy, out of eight software we analyzed, our approach led to more accurate results in seven cases. Only in one case, the accuracy of our approach was worse by 1.6 percent.}

	abstract = {A number of applications in next-generation multi-hop networks, e.g., vehicular networks, impose low-latency requirements on data transmission thereby necessitating the underlying relays to introduce negligible delay when forwarding the packets. While traditional relaying techniques such as amplify-and-forward protocols may help the packets to satisfy latency-constraints, such strategies do not facilitate the destination in learning the path traveled by the packets, which in turn could be used for either learning the topology of the network or detecting security threats on the network. In addition to low-latency constraints, vehicular networks also result in variable network topology owing to the mobility of the nodes, which in turn imposes additional challenges to the destination in learning the path traveled by the packets. Thus, with potential applications to vehicular networks, we address the problem of designing provenance embedding algorithms that reduce the delays on the packets and yet assist the destination in determining the path traveled by the packets with no knowledge of the network topology. We propose a new class of provenance embedding techniques, referred to as double-edge (DE) embedding techniques, wherein a subset of the relay nodes in the path strategically skip the provenance embedding process to reduce the delays on the packets. Using fixed-size bloom filters as tools to implement the double-edge embedding ideas, first, we derive upper bounds on the error-rates of the DE embedding techniques so that the parameters of the bloom filter can be chosen to facilitate provenance recovery within a given quality of service. Subsequently, we present experimental results on a test bed of XBee devices and Raspberry Pis to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques, and show that the DE embedding techniques offer latency benefits upto 17 percent along with remarkable reduction in error-rates in comparison with the baselines. We also present a security analysis of the proposed provenance embedding methods to asses their vulnerabilities against various attacks including impersonation threats.}

However, during planning, agents face the risk of having their private information leaked. This article proposes a novel strong privacy-preserving planning approach for logistic-like problems. This approach outperforms existing approaches by addressing two challenges: 1) simultaneously achieving strong privacy; completeness and efficiency; and 2) addressing communication constraints. These two challenges are prevalent in many real-world applications including logistics in military environments and packet routing in networks. To tackle these two challenges, our approach adopts the differential privacy technique, which can both guarantee strong privacy and control communication overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to apply differential privacy to the field of multi-agent planning as a means of preserving the privacy of agents for logistic-like problems. We theoretically prove the strong privacy and completeness of our approach and empirically demonstrate its efficiency. We also theoretically analyze the communication overhead of our approach and illustrate how differential privacy can be used to control it.}

	abstract = {Providing security and privacy in today's digital era is very crucial. In order to ensure that the sensitive user data can only be accessed by a valid server, the user and server should agree on a common key in advance. To do so, in the last decade, a number of dynamic ID-based authenticated key agreement (DIDAKA) protocols have been proposed, which can guarantee subsequent secure communications of users and servers. Nevertheless, investigating the related works indicates that the existing DIDAKA schemes suffer from one or more security challenges. Quite recently, Xie et al. have presented an interesting anonymous DIDAKA protocol to cover the security weaknesses of previous schemes; nonetheless, we found that their scheme is susceptible to three attacks. Therefore, to remedy the security limitations, in this article, we propose a security-enhanced anonymous DIDAKA protocol, which not only keeps the merits of Xie et al. 's scheme, but also offers better execution time compared to their proposed one. To demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme, we present both formal security proof and automatic formal verification of security and to show its efficiency, we present an extensive comparative performance analysis. In conclusion, the results are indicative of the priority of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {With increased inter-connectivity among disparate devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, including those deployed in a nation’s critical infrastructure, there is a need to ensure that any failure in the deployed devices can be detected. The capability to automatically detect device failures is particularly crucial in a large-scale, complex IoT system, since it can be very time-consuming and challenging to investigate a large number of geographically-dispersed devices that are also of different makes and types. In this paper, we present a faulty-device identification technique that is designed to achieve lightweight processor-level architectural support. Specifically, a hardware-based monitoring agent is incorporated within a processor and connected to a separate monitoring program when an examination is required. By analyzing information collected by the agent, the monitoring program determines whether the device being monitored is functioning. Findings from our detailed evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect around 90 percent of the failures with minimal hardware overhead of approximately 5k gates. This area overhead is reasonable and amounts to 7.69 percent of the ARM Cortex-M4 – a lightweight IoT-class processor – that has a total area (excluding optional caches and scratch-pad memory) of 65k gates.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, by integrating the smart devices carried by users with existing communication infrastructures to provide large-scale, fine-grained and complex sensing services, crowdsensing as a novel sensing paradigm has significantly enriched the applications of smart city and promoted the development of Internet of Things (IoT). However, privacy has become skyrocketing concern for crowdsensing and gravely affected the deployment of crowdsensing. In this article, we present a framework to make the tradeoff between minimizing data aggregation error and guaranteeing system stability by jointly considering the privacy of participants, the randomness of sensing task arrival and the cost of platform. We propose an online control mechanism by exploiting Lyapunov stochastic optimization technique. Additionally, considering that, in reality, it always takes different time for different tasks to make sensing decisions, we extend standard Lyapunov stochastic optimization technique to make separate decisions for different types of sensing tasks in consecutive time. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that our time-average data aggregation error is approximately optimal while still maintaining system stability. By carrying out extensive simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanisms.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers on-demand availability of computing resources over the Internet. To attract users, cloud providers offer their resources as services at reasonable prices and provide various price models to reflect higher level of quality of service (QoS), which are referred as pricing schemes. $k$ -times anonymous authentication ( $k$ -TAA) is an attractive approach to construct pricing schemes, providing access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. In $k$ -TAA schemes, authenticated users are permitted to anonymously access services from a provider at most $k$ times, while the ones whose the number of access times exceeds $k$ can be publicly traced. That is, $k$ -TAA schemes offer a prepaid plan that charges users based on the amount of access times. Alternatively, pay-as-you-go (PAYG) is a pricing strategy that allows users to be charged based on the amount of usage, reducing the costs on unnecessary resources. Adopting $k$ -TAA schemes to PAYG model, the access bound $k$ is decided by the prepayment amount and the service usage is tracked by the number of access times. However, this approach is impractical, since existing $k$ -TAA schemes only allow an one-time access in an authentication. This article aims to bridge this gap in the literature by designing an efficient and secure authentication system for PAYG cloud computing, supporting flexible access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. To achieve this, we propose a new $k$ -TAA primitive, called $k$ -times anonymous pay-as-you-go authentication ( $k$ -TAA-PAYG), that allows users to access services for multiple times in an authentication as long as the number of their access times does not exceed $k$ . We first formalize the definition and security model for $k$ -TAA-PAYG scheme. Subsequently, we present a concrete construction of $k$ -TAA-PAYG scheme, with the computational complexity as $O(1)$ and the constant communicational cost. Finally, comparing with the most efficient $k$ -TAA scheme proposed by Emura et al. , the experimental results show that our $k$ -TAA-PAYG scheme is 2.5 to 3 times faster and saves up to 66 percent storage in grant processes. The time cost of an authentication of our $k$ -TAA-PAYG scheme is constant (1.4-2.4 ms), while Emura et al. ’s scheme needs more than one second when the number of access time is greater than 1, 000.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that integrates a variety of heterogeneous nodes, such as connected devices (sensors, robots, and smart phones ...), connected cars, smart homes, etc. These smart objects communicate and collaborate in distributed and dynamic environments that are facing several security challenges. Trust management is one of the most important challenges in IoT. Existing trust management solutions do not meet the new requirements of IoT such as heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability. In this article, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based trust management protocol with mobility support in massively distributed IoT systems. In our protocol, mobile smart objects disseminate trust information on service providers to the blockchain. Thus, all the objects will have a global view on each service provider in the architecture, which speeds up the trust evaluation process. In addition, our protocol is resilient against the most known malicious attacks such as bad-mouthing , ballot-stuffing , and cooperative attacks . We confirm the efficiency of our proposal through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Finally, we show that it outperforms existing solutions, especially in terms of scalability, mobility support, communication, and computation costs.}

	abstract = {The prevalence and availability of cloud infrastructures has made them the de facto solution for storing and archiving data, both for organizations and individual users. Nonetheless, the cloud’s wide spread adoption is still hindered by dependability and security concerns, particularly in applications with large data collections where efficient search and retrieval services are also major requirements. This leads to an increased tension between security, efficiency, and search expressiveness. In this article we tackle this tension by proposing BISEN, a new provably-secure boolean searchable symmetric encryption scheme that improves these three complementary dimensions by exploring the design space of isolation guarantees offered by novel commodity hardware such as Intel SGX, abstracted as Isolated Execution Environments (IEEs). BISEN is the first scheme to support multiple users and enable highly expressive and arbitrarily complex boolean queries, with minimal information leakage regarding performed queries and accessed data, and verifiability regarding fully malicious adversaries. Furthermore, BISEN extends the traditional SSE model to support filter functions on search results based on generic metadata created by the users. Experimental validation and comparison with the state of art shows that BISEN provides better performance with enriched search semantics and security properties.}

	abstract = {We consider an outsourced computation model in the selective data sharing setting. Specifically, one of the data owners outsources the encrypted data to an untrusted cloud server, and wants to share the specific function of these data with a group of data users. A data user can perform the specific computation on the data that it is authorized to access. We propose a construction under this model for the inner product computation by using the Inner Product Functional Encryption (IPFE) as a building block. A standard IPFE used on this model has two privacy weaknesses regarding the master secret key and the encrypted vector. We propose a strengthened IPFE that revises these weaknesses. We construct a new IPFE scheme and use it to construct an efficient outsourced inner product computation scheme. In our outsourced computation scheme, the storage overhead and the computation cost for a data user are independent of the vector size. The result privacy and the outsourced data privacy are well preserved against the untrusted cloud server. The experimental results show that our schemes are efficient and practical.}

	abstract = {Due to the limitations of symmetric-key techniques, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols based on public-key techniques have attracted much attention, providing secure access and communication mechanism for various application environments. Among these public-key techniques used for AKA protocols, chaotic-map is more effective than scalar multiplication and modular exponentiation, and it offers a list of desirable cryptographic properties such as un-predictability, un-repeatability, un-certainty, and higher efficiency than scalar multiplication and modular exponentiation. Furthermore, it is usually believed that three-factor AKA protocols can achieve a higher security level than single- and two-factor protocols. However, none of existing three-factor AKA protocols can meet all security requirements. One of the most prevalent problems is how to balance security and usability, and particularly how to achieve truly three-factor security while providing password change friendliness. To deal with this problem, in this article we put forward a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol based on extended chaotic-maps for mobile lightweight devices, by adopting the techniques of “Fuzzy-Verifiers” and “Honeywords”. We prove the security of the proposed protocol in the random oracle model, assuming the intractability of extended chaotic-maps Computational Diffie-Hellman problem. We also simulate the protocol by using the AVISPA tool. The security analysis and simulation results show that our protocol can meet all 13 evaluation criteria regarding security. We also assess the performance of our protocol by comparing with seven other related protocols. The evaluation results demonstrate that our protocol offers better balance between security and usability over state-of-the-art ones.}

	abstract = {Separations of Duties (SoDs) are an important class of security requirements in business process management. Their violation may result in system misuse and fraud, leading to economic losses or legal implications. Hence, it is of paramount importance to ensure that a business process meets all SoDs. Existing works usually adopt model checking to verify SoDs. However, building formal models that simultaneously account for both workflow and SoDs is a time-consuming and error-prone activity. In this article, we propose a new approach to specifying and enforcing SoDs in business processes using Petri nets (PNs). First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the SoD violations from the viewpoint of structure and marking of PNs. We show that the SoD constraints can be enforced by disallowing the process to reach certain markings, with the constraints being written as linear inequalities. Then, we design supervisors to enforce SoDs in an off-line and a real-time manner, respectively, based on the linear inequalities. Meanwhile, inequality analysis is provided for the structural simplicity of supervisors. Finally, the complexity analysis of our approach and the comparison with the work in the literature are given to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ours.}

	abstract = {Federated deep learning has been widely used in various fields. To protect data privacy, many privacy-preservingapproaches have been designed and implemented in various scenarios. However, existing works rarely consider a fundamental issue that the data shared by certain users (called irregular users ) may be of low quality. Obviously, in a federated training process, data shared by many irregular users may impair the training accuracy, or worse, lead to the uselessness of the final model. In this article, we propose PPFDL, a Privacy-Preserving Federated Deep Learning framework with irregular users . In specific, we design a novel solution to reduce the negative impact of irregular users on the training accuracy, which guarantees that the training results are mainly calculated from the contribution of high-quality data. Meanwhile, we exploit Yao's garbled circuits and additively homomorphic cryptosystems to ensure the confidentiality of all user-related information. Moreover, PPFDL is also robust to users dropping out during the whole implementation. This means that each user can be offline at any subprocess of training, as long as the remaining online users can still complete the training task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PPFDL in terms of training accuracy, computation, and communication overheads.}

Up to now, many RDHEI algorithms have been reported, however, these reported RDHEI algorithms cannot achieve a high embedding capacity. Therefore, this article proposes a new RDHEI scheme, which will have improved performance. The main contributions of the proposed scheme include two points: chunk encryption (CE) and redundancy matrix representation (RMR). First, different from the encryption method of pixel-by-pixel encryption used in the previous RDHEI algorithms, CE is the method that uses the traditional exclusive-or (XOR) method to encrypt the original image in chunks. By using the CE method, redundancy will be retained in the encrypted chunks. Second, the RMR method is designed to generate available room for accommodating secret data in redundancy matrices, which are existed in some encrypted chunks. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves a high embedding capacity and the directly decrypted images retain high quality.}

It is designed for the memory system, and most existing work focused on improving performance in the main memory. Recently, ORAM has been extended to the cloud environment, and it is called Oblivious Data Storage. TaoStore, the state-of-the-art oblivious data storage system, integrates the ORAM technology with synchronous I/O technology to reduce the mean response time. As we observed, there is a strong locality existing in user accesses. However, existing Oblivious Storage research did not consider this. In this article, we propose Loco-Store, an oblivious data storage. In Loco-Store, we design a novel stash controller scheme that can dynamically group relevant blocks during the oblivious I/O processes. We also propose a locality-based eviction algorithm to keep the security guarantee. The theoretical proof proves that our scheme keeps the security definition of ORAM. Finally, we implement a prototype and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results show that Loco-Store can save the network bandwidth consumption up to 39.19 percent, and reduce the overall access time by 26.17 percent}

The proposed protocol supports exact pattern matching, approximate pattern matching and pattern matching with wildcards. It is analytically shown that the proposed protocol is considerably more efficient in the approximate matching with at most\nk\npermitted mismatches while it has the same speed in the exact matching case comparing with the recent work in the literature. The achievements are also experimentally evaluated on a case of secure Desoxyribo-Nucleic Acid (DNA) search over the NCBI dataset of the United States national library of medicine.

Because LDH can not only reconstruct the cover image losslessly but also keep the visual quality of the marked image no degradation. This article proposes a new LDH scheme for JPEG images by general variable length code (VLC) mapping. In this scheme, the run size values are first reordered. Then a feasible solution space is generated. A simulated embedding model is established to find the optimal solution from the feasible solution space. The optimal mapping relationship is constructed according to the optimal solution. According to the optimal GVM relationship, the Huffman table in the file header is modified and then the additional data can be embedded by replacing the used VLC with the VLCs in the same mapping set. Experimental results demonstrate that most of the JPEG images using the proposed scheme cause less file size increments than previous RDH schemes while keeping the marked JPEG image with no distortion. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can obtain high embedding capacity.}

	abstract = {The disruptive blockchain technology is expected to have broad applications in many areas due to its advantages of transparency, fault tolerance, and decentralization, but the open nature of blockchain also introduces severe privacy issues. Since anyone can deduce private information about relevant accounts, different privacy-preserving techniques have been proposed for cryptocurrencies under the UTXO model, e.g., Zerocash and Monero. However, it is more challenging to protect privacy for account-model blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) since it is much easier to link accounts in the account-model blockchain. In this article, we propose BlockMaze , an efficient privacy-preserving account-model blockchain based on zk-SNARKs. Along with dual-balance model, BlockMaze achieves strong privacy guarantees by hiding account balances, transaction amounts, and linkage between senders and recipients. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and prove the security of BlockMaze . Finally, we implement a prototype of BlockMaze based on Libsnark and Go-Ethereum, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our 300-node experiment results show that BlockMaze has high efficiency in computation and transaction throughput: one transaction verification takes about 14.2 ms, one transaction generation takes 6.1-18.6 seconds, and its throughput is around 20 TPS.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of low-power integrated circuits, wireless communication, intelligent sensors, and microelectronics has allowed the realization of wireless body area networks (WBANs), which can monitor patients’ vital body parameters remotely in real time to offer timely treatment. These vital body parameters are related to patients’ life and health; and these highly private data are subject to many security threats. To guarantee privacy, many secure communication protocols have been proposed. However, most of these protocols have a one-to-one structure in extra-body communication and cannot support multidisciplinary team (MDT). Hence, we propose a lightweight and certificateless multi-receiver secure data transmission protocol for WBANs to support MDT treatment in this article. In particular, a novel multi-receiver certificateless generalized signcryption (MR-CLGSC) scheme is proposed that can adaptively use only one algorithm to implement one of three cryptographic primitives: signature, encryption or signcryption. Then, a multi-receiver secure data transmission protocol based on the MR-CLGSC scheme with many security properties, such as data integrity and confidentiality, non-repudiation, anonymity, forward and backward secrecy, unlinkability and data freshness, is designed. Both security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed protocol for WBANs is secure, efficient, and highly practical.}

Fault injection is an effective means to bring out these failures in a controlled environment. However, fault injection experiments produce massive amounts of data, and manually analyzing these data is inefficient and error-prone, as the analyst can miss severe failure modes that are yet unknown. This article introduces a new paradigm ( fault injection analytics ) that applies unsupervised machine learning on execution traces of the injected system, to ease the discovery and interpretation of failure modes. We evaluated the proposed approach in the context of fault injection experiments on the OpenStack cloud computing platform, where we show that the approach can accurately identify failure modes with a low computational cost.}

However, the flourish of online disease risk assessment service still faces severe challenges including information privacy and security. In this article, based on the naïve Bayesian classification, we propose an effi c ient and priv a cy-prese r ving dis e ase r isk assessment scheme over multi-outsourced vertical datasets, named CARER. With CARER, the e-healthcare provider can securely train a disease risk predication model over vertically distributed medical data from multiple medical centers (i.e., hospitals), and provide privacy-preserving disease risk predication services for users (i.e., patients and doctors). During the model training and disease risk prediction phases, all sensitive data are operated over ciphertexts without decryption. As a result, the private information of medical centers, e-healthcare provider, and users can be well protected. Detailed security analysis shows that CARER can resist various known security threats. In addition, we evaluate the performance of CARER with real medical datasets, and the results demonstrate that CARER is efficient.}

In this article, we focus on a special item distribution system named RFID-enabled Third-party Distribution (RTD) system and identify two inherent security and privacy requirements. We further design a Secure RTD system called Ants, which uses cryptography to protect item messages carried by tags to satisfy both of the requirements while preserving the flexible data access manner of RFID technology. Ants introduces two new techniques named commitment accumulation and selective message proof for memory-constrained tags to carry long crypto-item messages. We conduct theoretical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the security and efficiency of Ants.}

	abstract = {Mobile cloud storage (MCS) provides clients with convenient cloud storage service. In this article, we propose an efficient, secure and privacy-preserving mobile cloud storage scheme, which protects the data confidentiality and privacy simultaneously, especially the access pattern. Specifically, we propose an oblivious selection and update (OSU) protocol as the underlying primitive of the proposed mobile cloud storage scheme. OSU is based on onion additively homomorphic encryption with constant encryption layers and enables the client to obliviously retrieve an encrypted data item from the cloud and update it with a fresh value by generating a small encrypted vector, which significantly reduces the client’s computation as well as the communication overheads. Compared with previous works, our presented work has valuable properties, such as fine-grained data structure (small item size), lightweight client-side computation (a few of additively homomorphic operations) and constant communication overhead, which make it more suitable for MCS scenario. Moreover, by employing the “verification chunks” method, our scheme can be verifiable to resist malicious cloud. The comparison and evaluation indicate that our scheme is more efficient than existing oblivious storage solutions with the aspects of client and cloud workloads, respectively.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage becomes the priority for storing and sharing data for enterprise users. Encrypting prior to uploading data to the cloud is the best way to protect business secrets, however, it hinders the convenient operations on plaintexts, such as searching over the cloud data. In addition, employees in an enterprise have multiple layer structures and a higher layer employee should have the privilege to monitor the lower layer employees’ data to check if these users violate the regulation without letting the employees be aware of. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is a well-known cryptographic primitive suitable for secure cloud storage, which supports keyword search without decryption in public key encryption settings. Unfortunately, no existing PEKS scheme supports the monitoring function without authorization from the sender. To address this issue, we propose a variant of PEKS named Hierarchical Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search (HPEKS) and provide a semi-generic construction utilizing a public key tree (PKTree) and a PEKS scheme. To better suit for the enterprise secret data sharing, we build an advanced HPEKS scheme, named designated-tester decryptable hierarchical public key encryption with keyword search (dDHPEKS), which enjoys stronger security and integrates the public key and symmetric key encryptions. We prove our dDHPEKS scheme secure under the security definition in the random oracle model. Particularly, it satisfies the security against outside offline keyword guessing attacks and furthermore, enjoys the transparency property so that the sender does not need to know the internal hierarchy structure of an enterprise in order to share encrypted data to the enterprise. Theoretical evaluation and concrete experiments show that our dDHPEKS scheme has comparable running efficiency with existing PEKS schemes.}

	abstract = {Coverage-guided fuzzing is a widely used and effective solution to find software vulnerabilities. Tracking code coverage and utilizing it to guide fuzzing are crucial to coverage-guided fuzzers. However, tracking full and accurate path coverage is infeasible in practice due to the high instrumentation overhead. Popular fuzzers (e.g., AFL) often use coarse coverage information, e.g., edge hit counts stored in a compact bitmap, to achieve highly efficient greybox testing. Such inaccuracy and incompleteness in coverage introduce serious limitations to fuzzers. First, it causes path collisions , which prevent fuzzers from discovering potential paths that lead to new crashes. More importantly, it prevents fuzzers from making wise decisions on fuzzing strategies. In this article, we propose a coverage sensitive fuzzing solution CollAFL. It mitigates path collisions by providing more accurate coverage information, while still preserving low instrumentation overhead. It also utilizes the coverage information to apply three new fuzzing strategies, promoting the speed of discovering new paths and vulnerabilities. We implemented two variants of this solution, namely CollAFL (based on AFL) and CollAFL-bin (based on AFL-dyninst), to test applications with and without source code respectively, and evaluated them on 24 popular applications. The results showed that path collisions are common, i.e., up to 75 percent of edges could collide with others in some applications. But our solutions CollAFL and CollAFL-bin could reduce the edge collision ratio to nearly zero. Moreover, armed with the three fuzzing strategies, they outperform their counterparts (i.e., AFL and AFL-dyninst) in terms of both code coverage and vulnerability discovery. On average, CollAFL covered 20 percent more program paths, and found 320 percent more unique crashes and 260 percent more bugs than AFL in 200 hours. Moreover, CollAFL-bin covered 15 percent more paths, and found 200 percent more unique crashes and 150 percent more vulnerabilities than AFL-dyninst, showing that the proposed solution also works for binary application fuzzing. In total, CollAFL found 157 new security bugs with 95 new CVEs assigned.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning models have been widely deployed in various application scenarios. The training processes of deep neural network (DNN) models are time-consuming, and require massive training data and large hardware overhead. These issues have led to the outsourced training procedure, pre-trained models supplied from third parties, or massive training data from untrusted users. However, a few recent researches indicate that, by injecting some well-designed backdoor instances into the training set, the attackers can create a concealed backdoor in the DNN model. In this way, the attacked model still works normally on the benign inputs, but when a backdoor instance is submitted, some specific abnormal behaviors will be triggered. Existing studies all focus on attacking a single target that triggered by a single backdoor (referred to as One-to-One attack), while the backdoor attacks against multiple target classes, and backdoor attacks triggered by multiple backdoors have not been studied yet. In this article, for the first time, we propose two advanced backdoor attacks, the multi-target backdoor attacks and multi-trigger backdoor attacks: 1) One-to-N attack, where the attacker can trigger multiple backdoor targets by controlling the different intensities of the same backdoor; 2) N-to-One attack, where such attack is triggered only when all the $N$ backdoors are satisfied. Compared with existing One-to-One attacks, the proposed two backdoor attacks are more flexible, more powerful and more difficult to be detected. Besides, the proposed backdoor attacks can be applied under the weak attack model, where the attacker has no knowledge about the parameters and architectures of the DNN models. Experimental results show that these two attacks can achieve better or similar performances when injecting a much smaller proportion or same proportion of backdoor instances than those existing One-to-One backdoor attacks. The two attack methods can achieve high attack success rates (up to 100 percent in MNIST dataset and 92.22 percent in CIFAR-10 dataset), while the test accuracy of the DNN model has hardly dropped (as low as 0 percent in LeNet-5 model and 0.76 percent in VGG-16 model), thus will not raise administrator’s suspicions. Further, the two attacks are also evaluated on a large and realistic dataset (Youtube Aligned Face dataset), where the maximum attack success rate reaches 90 percent (One-to-N) and 94 percent (N-to-One), and the accuracy degradation of target face recognition model (VGGFace model) is only 0.05 percent. The proposed One-to-N and N-to-One attacks are demonstrated to be effective and stealthy against two state-of-the-art defense methods.}

	abstract = {Order-preserving encryption (OPE) is a cryptographic primitive that preserves the order of plaintexts. In the past few years, many OPE schemes were proposed to solve the problem of executing range queries in encrypted databases. However, OPE leaks some certain information (for example, the order of ciphertext), so it is vulnerable to many attacks. Subsequently, order-revealing encryption (ORE) was proposed by Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) as a generalization of order-preserving encryption. It breaks through the limitation of the numeric order of OPE plaintext. It implements ciphertext comparison for any specific form of plaintext through a publicly computable comparison function. In this article, we aim to design a new ORE scheme which reduces the leakages and preserves the practicality in terms of ciphertext length and encryption time. We first propose the hybrid model named HybridORE . Then, we propose an improved scheme named EncodeORE which achieves acceptable security and appropriate ciphertext length. They both explore the encode strategy of encoding plaintext into different parts and apply suitable ORE algorithms to each part according to its security characteristics to reduce leakages. Compared with the typical CLWW scheme (FSE 2016) and Lewi-Wu (CCS 2016) in large domain, they have fewer leakages. The experiment shows that the proposed EncodeORE is very practical.}

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a popular architecture in machine learning for its predictive power, notably in computer vision and medical image analysis. Its great predictive power requires extensive computation, which encourages model owners to host the prediction service in a cloud platform. This article proposes a CNN prediction scheme that preserves privacy in the outsourced setting, i.e., the model-hosting server cannot learn the query, (intermediate) results, and the model. Similar to SecureML (S&P’17), a representative work that provides model privacy, we employ two non-colluding servers with secret sharing and triplet generation to minimize the usage of heavyweight cryptography. We made the following optimizations for both overall latency and accuracy. 1) We adopt asynchronous computation and SIMD for offline triplet generation and parallelizable online computation. 2) As MiniONN (CCS’17) and its improvement by the generic EzPC compiler (EuroS&P’19), we use a garbled circuit for the non-polynomial ReLU activation to keep the same accuracy as the underlying network (instead of approximating it in SecureML prediction). 3) For the pooling in CNN, we employ (linear) average-pooling, which achieves almost the same accuracy as the (non-linear, and hence less efficient) max-pooling exhibited by MiniONN and EzPC. Considering both offline and online costs, our experiments on the MNIST dataset show a latency reduction of\n122×\n,\n14.63×\n, and\n36.69×\ncompared to SecureML, MiniONN, and EzPC; and a reduction of communication costs by\n1.09×\n,\n36.69×\n, and\n31.32×\n, respectively. On the CIFAR dataset, our scheme achieves a lower latency by\n7.14×\nand\n3.48×\nand lower communication costs by\n13.88×\nand\n77.46×\nwhen compared with MiniONN and EzPC, respectively.}

	abstract = {With upcoming blockchain infrastructures, world-spanning Byzantine consensus is getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the pace at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogeneous latencies of connections between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network, consensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that utilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting weights to well-connected replicas. This approach enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism that improves the geographical scalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world. Essentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting-weight tuning and leader positioning scheme, which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system. It employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model seeking to minimize the system’s consensus latency. In experiments using several AWS EC2 regions, AWARE dynamically optimizes consensus latency by self-reliantly finding a fast configuration yielding latency gains observed by clients located across the globe.}

	abstract = {Remote Access Trojan (RAT) attacks have become an extensively prevailing and serious threat to enterprise security. A forensic system targeting RAT attacks is needed to record and reconstruct fine-grained semantic behaviors of RATs. However, existing forensic systems suffer from various issues such as intrusive instrumentation, nontrivial recording overhead, and RAT behavior blindness. In this article, we first conduct a large-scale study of a representative set of real-world RAT families active from 1999 to 2016. This is the first study to understand the landscape of RATs in the literature. Based on the study, we then propose RATScope , an instrumentation-free RAT forensic system targeting Windows platform. Specifically, RATScope offers an audit logging module to efficiently record system logs by leveraging Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), and provides a novel program behavior modeling technique to reconstruct semantic behaviors of RATs accurately. We implement a prototype of RATScope and evaluate the recording overhead and the behavior identification accuracy. The results show that the audit logging module only incurs 3.7 percent runtime overhead on average. Our system can achieve around 90 percent true positive rate in the cross-family experiment, around 80 percent true positive rate in the two-year spanning temporal experiment, and near zero false positive rate.}

	abstract = {Verifiable databases (VDB) enables the data owner to outsource a huge unencrypted database to the powerful but untrusted cloud such that any client could later retrieve the database and check whether the cloud returns valid records or not. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work considering privacy. Besides, they assume that the data owner and the client are fully trusted while they may be semi-honest in the real world. To address these problems, we propose a new primitive called privacy-preserving publicly verifiable database (PPVDB), which not only guarantees the integrity of the queried result but also leaks no information. At the end of this protocol, the client can check whether the cloud returns a valid result and learns the queried result but nothing else about the database. Besides, the cloud learns nothing about the database and the query, and the data owner does not know which item that the client has queried. Motivated by the comparison among some strawman solutions, we incorporate verifiable computation for the polynomial with oblivious pseudorandom function to construct a PPVDB scheme, which is the first VDB scheme providing stronger security against the malicious cloud and the semi-honest client and data owner.}

	abstract = {Systems integrators and vendors of industrial components need to establish a security-by-design approach, which includes the assessment and subsequent treatment of security risks. However, conducting security risk assessments along the engineering process is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor due to the complexity of the system(s) under consideration and the lack of automated methods. This, in turn, hampers the ability of security analysts to assess risks pertaining to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in an efficient manner. In this work, we propose a method that automatically identifies security risks based on the CPS's data representation, which exists within engineering artifacts. To lay the foundation for our method, we present security-focused semantics for the engineering data exchange format AutomationML (AML). These semantics enable the reuse of security-relevant know-how in AML artifacts by means of a formal knowledge representation, modeled with a security-enriched ontology. Our method is capable of automating the identification of security risk sources and potential consequences in order to construct cyber-physical attack graphs that capture the paths adversaries may take. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method through a case study and an open-source prototypical implementation. Finally, we prove that our solution is scalable by conducting a rigorous performance evaluation.}

However, this is a challenging task due to the heterogeneity and variety of components of a CPS, and the complex relationships between sensed values and potential attacks or anomalies. Such complex relationships are results of physical constraints and domain norms which exist in many CPS domains. In this article, we propose ABATe , an A utomatic B ehavioral A bstraction Te chnique based on neural networks for detecting anomalies in smart cyber-physical systems. Unlike traditional techniques which abstract the statistical properties of different sensor values, ABATe learns complex relationships between event vectors from normal operational data available in abundance with smart CPS and uses this abstracted model to detect anomalies. ABATe detected more than 88 percent of attacks in the publicly available SWaT dataset featuring data from a scaled down sewage water treatment plant with a very low false positive rate of 1 percent. We also evaluated our technique's ability to capture domain semantics and multi-domain adaptability using a real-world automotive dataset, as well as a synthetic dataset.}

	abstract = {Medical time series data analytics based on dynamic time warping (DTW) greatly benefits modern medical research. Driven by the distributed nature of medical data, the collaboration of multiple healthcare institutions is usually necessary for a sound medical conclusion. Among others, a typical use case is disease screening for public health, where multiple healthcare institutions wish to collaboratively detect over their joint datasets the patients whose medical records have similar features to the given query samples. However, sharing the medical data faces critical privacy obstacles with the increasingly strict legal regulations on data privacy. In this article, we present the design of a novel system enabling privacy-preserving DTW-based analytics on distributed medical time series datasets. Our system is built from a delicate synergy of techniques from both cryptography and data mining domains, where the key idea is to leverage observations on the advancements in plaintext DTW analytics (e.g., clustering and pruning) to facilitate the scalable computation in the ciphertext domain, through our tailored security design. Extensive experiments over real medical time series datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our system, e.g., our system is able to process a secure DTW query computation over 15K time series sequences in 34 minutes.}

In this article, we proposed MVP, which enables M achine learning prediction in a V erifiable and P rivacy preserving fashion. MVP features the properties of polynomial decomposition and prime-order bilinear groups to simultaneously facilitate oblivious evaluation and batch outcome verification while maintaining function privacy and input privacy. We further instantiated MVP with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and extensively evaluated its performance for the spam detection task on three practical Short Message Service (SMS) datasets. Our analysis and evaluation results reveal that MVP achieves the desired properties while incurring low computation and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {During disasters, existing telecommunication infrastructures are often congested or even destroyed. In these situations, mobile devices can form a backup communication network for civilians and emergency services using disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) principles. Unfortunately, such distributed and resource-constrained networks are particularly susceptible to a wide range of attacks such as terrorists trying to cause more harm. In this article, we present RESCUE , a resilient and secure device-to-device communication framework for emergency scenarios that provides comprehensive protection against common attacks. RESCUE features a minimalistic DTN protocol that, by design, is secure against notable attacks such as routing manipulations, dropping, message manipulations, blackholing, or impersonation. To further protect against message flooding and Sybil attacks, we present a twofold mitigation technique. First, a mobile and distributed certificate infrastructure particularly tailored to the emergency use case hinders the adversarial use of multiple identities. Second, a message buffer management scheme significantly increases resilience against flooding attacks, even if they originate from multiple identities, without introducing additional overhead. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RESCUE via large-scale simulations in a synthetic as well as a realistic natural disaster scenario. Our simulation results show that RESCUE achieves very good message delivery rates, even under flooding and Sybil attacks.}

Although a lot of research has been conducted for these issues, the situation has not been significantly improved. Different from existing victim-centric approaches, in this article we propose a new network-centric approach for the detection of distributed threat-events. The distributed network is treated as a holistic system that consists of spatially interconnected network elements. Network events are detected by the dynamic behavior analysis of the distributed networks. We develop a model consisting of two-layer random fields to describe the time-varying traffic forwarding behavior of the distributed networks. The bottom layer describes the interaction and influence of the network elements under the action of network events. Markovianity is adopted to characterize the spatiotemporal context of each network element’s behavior patterns. The top layer describes each network element’s traffic features driven by the underlying behavior patterns. A Gaussian mixture model is used to capture the statistical features of the network traffic for each behavior pattern. We derive algorithms for parameter estimation and event detection. Numerical experiments using real datasets and different network scenarios are presented to validate the proposed approach. Performance-related issues and comparison with related works are discussed.}

	abstract = {As cloud storage services have become popular nowadays, the integrity of outsourced data stored at untrusted servers received increased attention. Provable data possession (PDP) provides an effective and efficient solution for cloud data integrity by asking the cloud server to prove that the stored data are not tampered with or maliciously discarded without returning the actual data to users. In this article, we propose an efficient identity-based privacy-preserving provable data possession scheme (ID-P\n3\nDP) based on the RSA assumption for secure cloud storage. In ID-P\n3\nDP, a cloud user takes the outsourcing file and a global parameter in a time period as inputs to generate identity-based homomorphic authenticators, and any third-party auditor (TPA) can check the integrity of the outsourced file by verifying the validity of homomorphic authenticators. The distinguished feature of ID-P\n3\nDP is to support the aggregation of identity-based homomorphic authenticators generated by different users under the RSA assumption, which is an open problem in provable data possession. Specifically, we transfer the identity-based homomorphic authenticators generated in distinct time periods into those with the same period parameter, and the cloud can compress the homomorphic authenticators of different users to generate a data possession proof for integrity verification. Besides, by exploiting zero-knowledge proof, the leakage of outsourced data to TPA can be prevented. The soundness of ID-P\n3\nDP is proved based on the RSA assumption, and the privacy against TPA is perfectly preserved. Finally, we demonstrate ID-P\n3\nDP is more efficient on integrity verification than the existing BLS-based schemes, and cross-user aggregate verification can significantly reduce computational and communication overhead for TPA.}

The key technical idea is that the HTM learns a sparse distributed temporal representation of sequential data that turns out to be very useful for anomaly detection and simultaneous data prediction in real-time. Our results show that the proposed HTM can predict anomalies within 83–90 percent accuracy for three different application profiles, namely Standard, Reward Few False Positive, Reward Few False Negative for two different datasets. We show that the HTM is competitive to five state-of-the-art algorithms for anomaly detection. Moreover, for the multi-step prediction in the online setting, the same HTM achieves a low 0.0001 normalized mean square error, a low negative log-likelihood score of 1.5 and is also competitive to six state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. We demonstrate that the same HTM model can be used for both the tasks and can learn online in one-pass, in an unsupervised fashion and adapt to changing statistics. The other state-of-the-art algorithms are either less accurate or are limited to one of the tasks or cannot learn online in one-pass, and adapt to changing statistics.}

	abstract = {Cloud providers attempt to maintain the highest levels of isolation between Virtual Machines (VMs) and inter-user processes to keep co-located VMs and processes separate. This logical isolation creates an internal virtual network to separate VMs co-residing within a shared physical network. However, as co-residing VMs share their underlying VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor), virtual network, and hardware are susceptible to cross VM attacks. It is possible for a malicious VM to potentially access or control other VMs through network connections, shared memory, other shared resources, or by gaining the privilege level of its non-root machine. This research presents a two novel zero-day cross-VM network channel attacks. In the first attack, a malicious VM can redirect the network traffic of target VMs to a specific destination by impersonating the Virtual Network Interface Controller (VNIC). The malicious VM can extract the decrypted information from target VMs by using open source decryption tools such as Aircrack. The second contribution of this research is a privilege escalation attack in a cross VM cloud environment with Xen hypervisor. An adversary having limited privileges rights may execute Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), establish a connection with the root domain by exploiting the network channel, and acquiring the tool stack (root domain) which it is not authorized to access directly. Countermeasures against this attacks are also presented}

	abstract = {Despite the high stakes involved in smart contracts, they are often developed in an undisciplined manner, leaving the security and reliability of blockchain transactions at risk. In this article, we introduce ContraMaster—an oracle-supported dynamic exploit generation framework for smart contracts. Existing approaches mutate only single transactions; ContraMaster exceeds these by mutating the transaction sequences. ContraMaster uses data-flow, control-flow, and the dynamic contract state to guide its mutations. It then monitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results against a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities. Being a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is a violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to exploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster has not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types of vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors). We evaluate ContraMaster on 218 vulnerable smart contracts. The experimental results confirm its practical applicability and advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques, and also reveal three new types of attacks.}

	abstract = {Deploying machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) is an effective way to improve the security of industrial control systems (ICS). However, ML models themselves are vulnerable to adversarial examples, generated by deliberately adding subtle perturbation to the input sample that some people are not aware of, causing the model to give a false output with high confidence. In this article, our goal is to investigate the possibility of stealthy cyber attacks towards IDS, including injection attack, function code attack and reconnaissance attack, and enhance its robustness to adversarial attack. However, adversarial algorithms are subject to communication protocol and legal range of data in ICS, unlike only limited by the distance between original samples and newly generated samples in image domain. We propose two strategies - optimal solution attack and GAN attack - oriented to flexibility and volume of data, formulating an optimization problem to find stealthy attacks, where the former is appropriate for not too large and more flexible samples while the latter provides a more efficient solution for larger and not too flexible samples. Finally, we conduct experiments on a semi-physical ICS testbed with a high detection performance ensemble ML-based detector to show the effectiveness of our attacks. The results indicate that new samples of reconnaissance and function code attack produced by both optimal solution and GAN algorithm possess 80 percent higher probability to evade the detector, still maintaining the same attack effect. In the meantime, we adopt adversarial training as a method to defend against adversarial attack. After training on the mixture of orginal dataset and newly generated samples, the detector becomes more robust to adversarial examples.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become ubiquitous and greatly affected peoples’ daily lives. With the increasing development of IoT devices, the corresponding security issues are becoming more and more challenging. Such a severe security situation raises the following questions that need urgent attention: What are the primary security threats that IoT devices face currently? How do vendors and users deal with these threats? In this article, we aim to answer these critical questions through a large-scale systematic study. Specifically, we perform a ten-month-long empirical study on the vulnerability of 1,362,906 IoT devices varying from six types. The results show sufficient evidence that N-days vulnerability is seriously endangering the IoT devices: 385,060 (28.25 percent) devices suffer from at least one N-days vulnerability. Moreover, 2669 of these vulnerable devices may have been compromised by botnets. We further reveal the massive differences among five popular IoT search engines: Shodan [1], Censys [2], [3], Zoomeye [4], Fofa [5], and NTI [6]. To study whether vendors and users adopt defenses against the threats, we measure the security of MQTT [7] servers, and identify that 12740 (88 percent) MQTT servers have no password protection. Our analysis can serve as an important guideline for investigating the security of IoT devices, as well as advancing the development of a more secure environment for IoT systems.}

	abstract = {Outsourcing machine learning inference services to the cloud is getting increasingly popular. However, this also entails privacy risks to the provider's proprietary model and the client's sensitive data. Focusing on inference with decision trees, this article proposes a framework for securely and efficiently outsourcing decision tree inference. Targeting both privacy and efficiency, we propose a customized protocol using only lightweight cryptography in the online execution of secure inference. We resort to additive secret sharing and tackle the problems in various components including secure input feature selection, decision node evaluation, and inference result generation. Our protocol requires no interaction from the provider and client during online secure inference, a distinct advantage over prior works for practical deployment as they all operate under the client-provider setting where synchronous and continuous interaction is required. Performance evaluation demonstrates our security design's efficiency, as well as substantial performance benefits for the client (up to four orders of magnitude in computation and 163 times in communication), as opposed to prior art in the non-outsourcing setting. To facilitate the practical usage for meeting more service demands, we also investigate the extensions for secure outsourced inference of random forests and categorical feature-based decision trees.}

	abstract = {The field of cryptography has endeavored to solve numerous security problems. However, a common premise of many of those problems is that the encryptor always generates the ciphertext correctly. Around 10 years ago, this premise was not a problem. However, due to the rapid development and the use of the cloud, which has introduced various access policies and functionalities to provide higher security, it is not correct to assume that this premise is always applied. A “Fake Policy Attack”, which we introduce in this article, is an attack that incorrectly sets the access policy of the ciphertext against the system rules so that users who do not meet the rules can decrypt the ciphertext. In other words, it is an attack that ignores the rules of the system and eventually breaks the security and leaks information. This attack can be more critical for the application environments that require strong security not to leak any related information about ciphertext. In this article, we demonstrate the possible threat of the Fake Policy Attack by providing two relevant examples. Then, we propose a scheme called Policy Authenticable ABE (PA-ABE) to resolve this issue. We provide a formal security analysis of the proposed scheme and performance evaluation results based on our implementation.}

	abstract = {With more and more data moving to the cloud, privacy of user data have raised great concerns. Client-side encryption/decryption seems to be an attractive solution to protect data security, however, the existing solutions encountered three major challenges: low security due to encryption with low-entropy PIN, inconvenient data sharing with traditional encryption algorithms, and poor usability with dedicated software/plugins that require certain types of terminals. This work designs and implements WebCloud, a practical browser-side encryption solution, leveraging modern Web technologies. It solves all the above three problems while achieves several additional remarkable features: robust and immediate user revocation, fast data processing with offline encryption and outsourced decryption. Notably, our solution works on any device equipped with a Web user agent, including Web browsers, mobile and PC applications. We implement WebCloud based on ownCloud for basic file management utility, and utilize WebAssembly and Web Cryptography API for complex cryptographic operations integration. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted with many well-known browsers, Android and PC applications, which indicates that WebCloud is cross-platform and efficient. As an interesting by-product, the design of WebCloud naturally embodies a dedicated and practical ciphertext-policy attribute-based key encapsulation mechanism (CP-AB-KEM) scheme, which can be useful in other applications.}

	abstract = {Password authentication is the dominant form of access control for the Web and mobile devices, and its practicality and ubiquity is unlikely to be replaced by other authentication approaches in the foreseeable future. To guarantee the security of data communication and mitigate the problem of password-cracking, a Password Authenticated Key Exchange ( PAKE ) system can be deployed between two peer participants. The main drawback of traditional PAKE is that passwords are exposed in plaintext when the remote server is compromised. To overcome this limitation, it is recommended by industry standards (such as SRP family RFC 5054, RFC6628, RFC7914, OPAQUE, etc ) to use asymmetric - PAKE protocols, which enable the server to store a hash of the user's password with a random salt, providing guarantees that the user's password is never transmitted in plain-text to the server when login. However, most of the existing asymmetric - PAKE protocols either are based on traditional hash functions under random oracles, or depend on non-quantum-secure hardness assumptions and become insecure in the quantum era. To bridge the gap between asymmetric - PAKE and quantum-security, in this article, we resort to smooth projective hash functions ( SPHF ) and commitment -based password-hashing schemes ( PHS ) over lattice-based cryptography, and construct an asymmetric PAKE protocol secure against quantum attacks. Our construction eliminates the costly non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) method, bypasses assumptions of the random oracle model, and achieves quantum resistance. We also show that our asymmetric- PAKE protocol can achieve security and efficiency under the Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (BPR) model. Finally, we develop a prototype implementation of our instantiation and use it to evaluate its performance in realistic settings.}

	abstract = {Obfuscation is a prevalent security technique which transforms syntactic representation of a program to a complicated form, but still keeps program semantics unchanged. So far, developers heavily rely on obfuscation to harden their products and reduce the risk of adversarial reverse engineering. However, despite its spectacular progress, one crucial hurdle is that each of existing obfuscation method is designed specifically for obfuscating one program feature (e.g., identifier name, control flow), so an effective obfuscation scheme usually composes a considerable amount of different obfuscation methods. Therefore, one primary challenge lies in identifying effective combinations of obfuscation methods. In this research, we propose a principled technique for generating an optimal program obfuscation scheme by adopting a reinforcement learning approach. Given a program and a set of obfuscation transformations, a reinforcement learning model is progressively trained to select a sequence of obfuscation transformations, such that applying each transformation in order toward the program yields the optimal obfuscation result, making programs dissimilar while retaining reasonable instrumentation overhead. Our implementation can directly work on raw binary executables without source code, and our evaluation demonstrates that the trained models can effectively obfuscate executable files with low cost.}

The concept of context-awareness is incorporated in LIP, which can be viewed as exploiting of data prior (both in privatizing and post-processing) to enhance data utility. We present an optimization framework to minimize the mean square error of data aggregation while protecting the privacy of each user’s input data or a correlated latent variable by satisfying LIP constraints. Then, we study optimal mechanisms under different scenarios considering the prior uncertainty and correlation with a latent variable. Three types of mechanisms are studied in this article, including randomized response (RR), unary encoding (UE), and local hashing (LH), and we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal perturbation parameters that are prior-dependent. We compare LIP-based mechanisms with those based on LDP, and theoretically show that the former achieve enhanced utility. We then study two applications: (weighted) summation and histogram estimation, and show how proposed mechanisms can be applied to each application. Finally, we validate our analysis by simulations using both synthetic and real-world data. Results show the impact on data utility by different prior distributions, correlations, and input domain sizes. Results also show that our LIP-based mechanisms provide better utility-privacy tradeoffs than LDP-based ones.}

	abstract = {An attack graph is a method used to enumerate the possible paths that an attacker can take in the organizational network. MulVAL is a known open-source framework used to automatically generate attack graphs. MulVAL's default modeling has two main shortcomings. First, it lacks the ability to represent network protocol vulnerabilities, and thus it cannot be used to model common network attacks, such as ARP poisoning. Second, it does not support advanced types of communication, such as wireless and bus communication, and thus it cannot be used to model cyber-attacks on networks that include IoT devices or industrial components. In this article, we present an extended network security model for MulVAL that: (1) considers the physical network topology, (2) supports short-range communication protocols, (3) models vulnerabilities in the design of network protocols, and (4) models specific industrial communication architectures. Using the proposed extensions, we were able to model multiple attack techniques including: spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial of service attacks, as well as attacks on advanced types of communication. We demonstrate the proposed model in a testbed which implements a simplified network architecture comprised of both IT and industrial components.}

	abstract = {Hybrid fuzzing that combines fuzzing and concolic execution has become an advanced technique for software vulnerability detection. Based on the observation that fuzzing and concolic execution are complementary in nature, state-of-the-art hybrid fuzzing systems deploy “optimal concolic testing” and “demand launch” strategies. Although these ideas sound intriguing, we point out several fundamental limitations in them, due to unrealistic or oversimplified assumptions. Further, we propose a novel “discriminative dispatch” strategy and design a probabilistic hybrid fuzzing system to better utilize the capability of concolic execution. Specifically, we design a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic path prioritization model to quantify each path’s difficulty, and then prioritize them for concolic execution. Our model assigns the most difficult paths to concolic execution. We implement a prototype named\nDigFuzz\nand evaluate our system with two representative datasets and real-world programs. Results show that the concolic execution in\nDigFuzz\noutperforms than those in state-of-the-art hybrid fuzzing systems in every major aspect. In particular, the concolic execution in\nDigFuzz\ncontributes to discovering more vulnerabilities (12 versus 5) and producing more code coverage (18.9 versus 3.8 percent) on the CQE dataset than the concolic execution in Driller.}

However, existing schemes are generally not scalable due to limitations associated with the anonymity set and self-credibility. In this article, we propose an efficient coin mixing scheme (hereafter referred to as CoinLayering). To achieve strong anonymity, CoinLayering randomly selects two sets of middlepersons to respectively execute Bitcoin holding and Bitcoin trading. The seller can also select lower-loaded sets of middlepersons in the shortest time possible. We also design two coin mixing protocols, CoinLayering-PA and CoinLayering-PB, to mitigate the risk due to misbehaving middlepersons and\nSupervisor\n. We then mathematically prove that CoinLayering achieves both strong anonymity and self-credibility, and evaluate its performance to demonstrate its scalability.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that technology and voltage scaling are expected to increase the likelihood that particle-induced soft errors manifest as multiple-bit errors. This raises concerns about the validity of using single bit-flips in fault injection experiments aiming to assess the program-level impact of soft errors. The goal of this article is to investigate whether multiple-bit errors could cause a higher percentage of silent data corruptions (SDCs) compared to single-bit errors. Based on 2700 fault injection campaigns with 15 benchmark programs, featuring a total of 27 million experiments, our results show that single-bit errors in most cases either yield a higher percentage of SDCs compared to multiple-bit errors or yield SDC results that are very close to the ones obtained for the multiple-bit errors. Further, we find that only around 2 percent of the multiple-bit campaigns resulted in an SDC percentage that was more than 5 percentage points higher than that obtained for the corresponding single-bit campaigns. For most of these campaigns, the highest percentage of SDCs was obtained by flipping at most 3 bits. Based on our results, we also propose four techniques for error space pruning to avoid injection of multiple-bit errors that are either unlikely or infeasible to cause SDCs.}

	abstract = {Machine learning service API allows model owners to monetize proprietary models by offering prediction services to third-party users. However, existing literature shows that model parameters are vulnerable to extraction attacks which accumulate prediction queries and their responses to train a replica model. As countermeasures, researchers have proposed to reduce the rich API output, such as hiding the precise confidence. Nonetheless, even with response being only one bit, an adversary can still exploit fine-tuned queries with differential property to infer the decision boundary of the underlying model. In this article, we propose boundary differential privacy (BDP) against such attacks by obfuscating the prediction responses with noises. BDP guarantees an adversary cannot learn the decision boundary of any two classes by a predefined precision no matter how many queries are issued to the prediction API. We first design a perturbation algorithm called boundary randomized response for a binary model. Then we prove it satisfies\nϵ\n-BDP, followed by a generalization of this algorithm to a multiclass model. Finally, we generalize a hard boundary to soft boundary and design an adaptive perturbation algorithm that can still work in the latter case. The effectiveness and high utility of our solution are verified by extensive experiments on both linear and non-linear models.}

	abstract = {To achieve efficiently search and update on outsourced encrypted data, dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) was proposed by just leaking some well-defined leakages. Though small, many recent works show that an attacker can exploit these leakages to undermine the security of existing DSSE schemes. In particular, an attacker can exploit even seemingly harmless size pattern to perform severe attacks. Many exiting schemes resort to oblivious RAM (ORAM) to hide search/access pattern; however, even such powerful cryptographic primitive cannot protect size pattern leakage. In this article, we first show that size pattern can lead to more information leakages, which is not well studied or protected by existing schemes. We then extend the existing privacy notion for DSSE to capture the size pattern leakage, achieving a strong forward and backward privacy definition. Following the definition, we propose a new DSSE scheme Eurus. Eurus can eliminate search/access pattern by relying on a multi-server ORAM scheme, meanwhile reducing size pattern with reasonable efficiency. We show that Eurus can reduce leakage significantly with better efficiency, compared with state-of-the-art leakage reduction schemes.}

	abstract = {With the prosperity of wireless and mobile communications, the allocation of wireless resources, e.g., spectrum channels, femtocell access permissions, and resource blocks of D2D connections, has become a matter of great concern, which leads to the emergence and popularity of electronic auction. However, the lack of privacy protection and fairness guarantee in the existing market has posed great obstacles to user participation in electronic auctions. Without privacy protection, users will be worried about the unauthorized exposure of their commercial secrets, which may hurt their payoffs in the long run. Without fairness guarantee, selfish/malicious users may prematurely abort the auction to avoid unsatisfactory payment, thus causing loss to honest users and wasting system resources. Furthermore, the lack of fairness guarantee will incur an exchange dilemma, where mutually distrusting parties may refuse to initiate the goods/money exchange, hindering the market-clearing of auctions. Although extensive efforts have been made to develop privacy-preserving auction mechanisms for wireless markets, the fairness issue, to the best of our knowledge, has never been taken into account in the context of auctions. Moreover, a truly practical framework that can be applied to most mainstream auction formats is also missing in the literature. In this article, we present the first general framework, named SAFE, for representative auctions in (but not limited to) wireless markets. SAFE achieves a wide range of security goals with much higher efficiency than existing solutions. Furthermore, SAFE ensures auction fairness in a trust-free manner by developing a full set of carefully-designed modular protocols that can be easily adapted to any auction format. We implement the SAFE framework over a simulated Ethereum network. Extensive experimental results confirm that SAFE can indeed achieve high economic efficiency in terms of social welfare and participation satisfaction at very low computation and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control System (ICS) security has become increasingly important as attacks targeting ICSs are more prominent. Although many off-the-shelf industrial network intrusion detection mechanisms have been presented in the past, attackers have always found unique disguisable ways to bypass detections and disrupt actual industrial control processes. To mitigate this deficiency, we present a novel scheme for the detection of industrial process control attacks, called ShadowPLCs . Specifically, the scheme first automatically analyzes the PLC control code, then extracts key parameters of the PLCs including valid register addresses, valid range of values, and control logic rules as a basis for evaluating attacks. The attack behavior is detected in real-time from different perspectives through active communication with PLCs and passive monitoring of the network traffic. We implemented a prototype system with Siemens S7-300 series PLCs as a case study. Our scheme was evaluated using two Siemens S7-300 PLCs deployed on a gas pipeline network platform. Experiments demonstrate that the presented scheme can accurately detect process control attacks in real-time without affecting the normal operations of PLCs. Compared with the other four representative detection models, our scheme has better detection performance with detection accuracy of 97.3 percent.}

	abstract = {Sharding blockchains are proposed to solve the scalability problem while maintaining security and decentralization. However, there are still many issues to be solved. First, the member selection and assignment process are not strictly analyzed, which might lead to an increase in the adversary proportion. Second, current intra-shard consensus algorithms are inefficient. Besides, cross-shard transaction processing costs expensive system overhead. Moreover, there is a lack of a formal security framework. In this article, we propose a secure and scalable hybrid consensus (SSHC). First, we propose a fair sharding selection scheme to select committee members, including mining processes and member lists confirmation by a reference committee. Second, a pipelined Byzantine fault tolerance for intra-shard consensus is designed, combining the pipelined technology with threshold signatures. Third, we propose a responsive sharding transaction batch processing mechanism to handle cross-shard transactions, which reduces the number of calls to Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms. Fourth, a secure committee reconfiguration method is designed to update shard members efficiently. Furthermore, we employ a formal security framework to design and analyze a sharding blockchain. For an adversary whose computational power fraction is less than\n1/3\n, by reasonably setting a corruption parameter and other related parameters, SSHC is proved to achieve consistency and liveness.}

This article elegantly addresses these challenges by proposing a novel conditional privacy-preserving authentication with dynamic membership for VANETs depending on chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Specifically, the CRT is utilized by a trusted authority to securely disseminate a domain key for the authorized vehicles in the same domain, where each vehicle in this domain is able to obtain the domain key by only performing one modulo division operation in case of domain key updating. Distinct from the previous works in this field, our proposed protocol not only achieves message authentication, anonymity and conditional privacy-preserving, but also provides forward security and backward security of vehicles. Theoretical analysis and experiment simulation demonstrate that the proposed protocol is provably secure and highly feasible.}

This article presents the Trust but Verify (TBV) middleware that promotes the idea that software components should not blindly trust each other. The TBV intercepts messages between a sender and a receiver to verify the consistency of the messages against rules associated with message types; this verification considers the system state. Based on the verification, a message is either delivered to the recipient or blocked. Even when components are mutually authenticated, it is possible that their counterparts are faulty or acting maliciously, persuading the receiver to take harmful actions. The contributions of this article are: (1) The design of the TBV middleware. (2) A proof-of-concept implementation of the TBV on a cyberphysical system—a water treatment facility. (3) An experimental validation of the TBV through several attack scenarios that allow compromised or faulty components to randomly send erroneous messages. These experiments measure the TBV’s detection rate as well as its overhead. (4) An evaluation of the TBV overhead and performance degradation.}

Different with previous works, DE-Sword works in a dishonest-data owner model in which participants are the owners of tag records and may be dishonest. DE-Sword introduces a novel double-edged reputation incentive mechanism to encourage participants to behave honestly; and couples it with cryptographic primitives to ensure query verifiability. We evaluate DE-Sword through game theory, security analysis, and performance evaluation. The game theory and security analysis shows that DE-Sword guarantees query verifiability. The evaluation results show that DE-Sword incurs low overhead in supply chain systems.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing is considered as one of the most prominent paradigms in the information technology industry, since it can significantly reduce the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. This convenience has enabled corporations to efficiently use the cloud storage as a mechanism to share data among their employees. At the first sight, by merely storing the shared data as plaintext in the cloud storage and protect them using an appropriate access control would be a nice solution. This is assuming that the cloud is fully trusted for not leaking any information, which is impractical as the cloud is owned by a third party. Therefore, encryption is mandatory, and the shared data will need to be stored as a ciphertext using an appropriate access control. However, in practice, some of these employees may be malicious and may want to deviate from the required sharing policy. The existing protection in the literature has been explored to allow only legitimate recipients to decrypt the contents stored in the cloud storage, but unfortunately, no existing work deals with issues raised due to the presence of malicious data publishers. Malicious data publishers construct data following the given policy, but the ciphertexts can actually be decrypted by unauthorized users without valid keys, or simply, anyone else who is unauthorized. The impact of the involvement of malicious data publishers is detrimental, as it may damage intellectual properties from the corporations. Therefore, it remains an elusive research problem on how to enable a sound approach to resolve the issue when malicious data publishers are involved in the system, which is a very practical question. In this work, we present a new direction of research that can cope with the presence of malicious data publishers. We resolve the aforementioned problem by proposing the notion of Sanitizable Access Control System (SACS), which is designed for a secure cloud storage that can also resist against malicious data publishers. We define the threat model and its formal security model, as well as its design and scheme which is based on q -Parallel Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent Assumption. We provide the security proof of our construction as well as its performance analysis. We believe that this work has opened a new area of research which has never been explored before, even though it is very practical. Therefore, this work will enhance the adoption of secure cloud storage in practice.}

	abstract = {The benchmarking of security tools is endeavored to determine which tools are more suitable to detect system vulnerabilities or intrusions. The analysis process is usually oversimplified by employing just a single metric out of the large set of those available. Accordingly, the decision may be biased by not considering relevant information provided by neglected metrics. This article proposes a novel approach to take into account several metrics, different scenarios, and the advice of multiple experts. The proposal relies on experts quantifying the relative importance of each pair of metrics towards the requirements of a given scenario. Their judgments are aggregated using group decision making techniques, and pondered according to the familiarity of experts with the metrics and scenario, to compute a set of weights accounting for the relative importance of each metric. Then, weight-based multi-criteria-decision-making techniques can be used to rank the benchmarked tools. The usefulness of this approach is showed by analyzing two different sets of vulnerability and intrusion detection tools from the perspective of multiple/single metrics and different scenarios.}

The implementation of the protection scheme becomes an important factor in protecting PAP against attacks. We focus on two basic protection in Android, i.e., SSL/TLS-based PAP and timestamp-based PAP. Previously, we proposed an automated tool, GLACIATE , to detect authentication flaws. We were curious whether orchestration (i.e., involving manual-effort) works better than automation. To answer this question, we propose an orchestrated approach, AuthExploit and compare its effectiveness GLACIATE . We study requirements for correct implementation of PAP and then apply GLACIATE to identify protection enhancements automatically. Through dependency analysis, GLACIATE matches the implementations against the abstracted flaws to recognise defective apps. To evaluate AuthExploit , we collected 1,200 Android apps from Google Play. We compared AuthExploit with the automation tool, GLACIATE , and two other orchestration tools,\nMalloDroid\nand\nSMV−Hunter\n. The results demonstrated that orchestration tools detect flaws more precisely although the F1 score of GLACIATE is higher than AuthExploit . Further analysis of the results reveals that highly popular apps and e-commerce apps are not more secure than other apps.}

	abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used and vital to industry and society. Their failure can have severe impact on both the economy and human life. Hence, these systems have become an attractive target for physical and cyber attacks alike. In this article, we examine an attack detection method based on simple and lightweight neural networks, namely, 1D convolutional neural networks and autoencoders. We apply these networks to both the time and frequency domains of the data and discuss the pros and cons of each representation approach. The suggested method is evaluated on three popular public datasets, and detection rates matching or exceeding previously published detection results are achieved, while demonstrating a small footprint, short training and detection times, and generality. We also show the effectiveness of PCA, which, given proper data preprocessing and feature selection, can provide high attack detection rates in many settings. Finally, we study the proposed method’s robustness against adversarial attacks that exploit inherent blind spots of neural networks to evade detection while achieving their intended physical effect. Our results show that the proposed method is robust to such evasion attacks: in order to evade detection, the attacker is forced to sacrifice the desired physical impact on the system.}

	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing, the great amount of storage data requires safe and efficient data sharing. In multiparty storage data sharing, first, the confidentiality of shared data is ensured to achieve data privacy preservation. Second, the security of stored data is ensured. That is, when stored shared data are subject to frequent access operations, the address sequence or access pattern of data is hidden. Therefore, determining how to ensure the untraceability of stored data or efficient hide the data access pattern in sharing stored data is a challenge. By employing the proxy re-encryption algorithm and oblivious random access memory (ORAM), a privacy-preserving and untraceable scheme is proposed to support multiple users in sharing data in cloud computing. On the one hand, group members and a proxy use the key exchange phase to obtain keys and resist multiparty collusion if necessary. The ciphertext obtained according to the proxy re-encryption phase enables group members to implement access control and store data, thereby completing secure data sharing. On the other hand, this article realizes data untraceability and a hidden data access pattern through a one-way circular linked table in a binary tree (OCLT) and obfuscation operation. Additionally, based on the designed structure and pointer tuple, malicious users are identified and data tampering is prevented. The security analysis shows that the protocol designed in this article can meet the security requirements of proxy re-encryption and ORAM. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for group data sharing in cloud computing.}

	abstract = {The authentication and content protection of multimedia data is a challenging task in the present scenario. One solution is to generate the perceptual hash which essentially authenticates the multimedia data and can also be dealt with image database search problems. In this article, a novel system for generating an image hash is presented. The proposed system utilizes the global and local features in the hash generation process. The local features are obtained from non-linear scale-space based KAZE features. These KAZE features have the ability to capture the most stable point under several content preserving distortions. In contrast, first the input image is converted to a normalized image, it is transformed to the log-polar coordinate system, and then a reference image using the local contrast in the wavelet domain is obtained to extrcat the global features. An intermediate hash sequence is achieved by extracting the significant information from the reference image using the singular value decomposition. The final hash sequence combines both the vectors followed by the randomization process. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and the robustness of the proposed hashing system against a wide range of intentional/unintentional distortions. Further, the comparative analysis with some state-of-the-art techniques validates the better discrimination of the proposed work.}

	abstract = {Charging coordination is necessary for the successful integration of the Energy Storage Units (ESUs), including electric vehicles and home batteries, into the smart grid. To coordinate charging, the ESUs should send charging requests including time-to-complete-charging (TCC) and battery state-of-charge (SoC) to the charging controller (CC) for scheduling charging, but these data can reveal sensitive information on the ESUs’ owners such as their locations, when they return home and whether they are on travel. In this article, we propose centralized and decentralized privacy-preserving and collusion-resistant charging coordination schemes for ESUs. In the centralized scheme, ESUs authenticate their requests using anonymous tokens. To thwart linkability attacks where the CC uses TCC and SoC to link requests sent from the same ESU at consecutive time slots, an ESU needs to send multiple charging requests with different TCC and SoC values instead of only one request. In the decentralized scheme, charging is coordinated in a distributed way using a privacy-preserving data aggregation technique. The idea is that each ESU selects some ESUs to act as proxies, and shares a secret mask with each proxy. Then, each ESU adds a mask to its charging request and encrypts it so that by aggregating all requests, all masks are nullified and the total charging demand is known, and then it is used to compute the charging schedules. Due to using masking technique, the scheme is secure against collusion attacks. The results of extensive experiments and simulations confirm that our schemes are efficient and secure, and can preserve ESU owners’ privacy and thwart linkability attacks.}

	abstract = {The detection of software vulnerabilities (or vulnerabilities for short) is an important problem that has yet to be tackled, as manifested by the many vulnerabilities reported on a daily basis. This calls for machine learning methods for vulnerability detection. Deep learning is attractive for this purpose because it alleviates the requirement to manually define features. Despite the tremendous success of deep learning in other application domains, its applicability to vulnerability detection is not systematically understood. In order to fill this void, we propose the first systematic framework for using deep learning to detect vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs with source code. The framework, dubbed Syntax-based, Semantics-based, and Vector Representations (SySeVR), focuses on obtaining program representations that can accommodate syntax and semantic information pertinent to vulnerabilities. Our experiments with four software products demonstrate the usefulness of the framework: we detect 15 vulnerabilities that are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database. Among these 15 vulnerabilities, seven are unknown and have been reported to the vendors, and the other eight have been “silently” patched by the vendors when releasing newer versions of the pertinent software products.}

SAFE works directly on disassembled binary functions, does not require manual feature extraction, is computationally more efficient than existing solutions, and is more general as it works on stripped binaries and on multiple architectures. Results from our experimental evaluation show how SAFE provides a performance improvement with respect to previous solutions. Furthermore, we show how SAFE can be used in widely different use cases, thus providing a general solution for several application scenarios.}

	abstract = {The Social Internet of Things (SIoT), integration of the Internet of Things, and Social Networks paradigms, has been introduced to build a network of smart nodes that are capable of establishing social links. In order to deal with misbehaving service provider nodes, service requestor nodes must evaluate their trustworthiness levels. In this article, we propose a novel trust management mechanism in the SIoT to predict the most reliable service providers for each service requestor, which leads to reduce the risk of being exposed to malicious nodes. We model the SIoT with a flexible bipartite graph (containing two sets of nodes: service providers and service requestors), then build a social network among the service requestor nodes, using the Hellinger distance. Afterward, we develop a social trust model using nodes’ centrality and similarity measures to extract trust behaviors among the social network nodes. Finally, a matrix factorization technique is designed to extract latent features of SIoT nodes, find trustworthy nodes, and mitigate the data sparsity and cold start problems. We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed trust prediction mechanism on prediction accuracy. The results indicate that feedbacks from the neighboring nodes of a specific service requestor with high Hellinger similarity in our mechanism outperforms the best existing methods. We also show that utilizing the social trust model, which only considers a similarity measure, significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management system through a real-world SIoT use case. Our results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is resilient to different types of network attacks, and it can accurately find the most proper and trustworthy service provider.}

	abstract = {Traditional anonymous networks (e.g., Tor) are vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks that monitor the whole network traffic to determine which users are communicating. To preserve user anonymity against traffic analysis attacks, the emerging mix networks mess up the order of packets through a set of centralized and explicit shuffling nodes. However, this centralized design of mix networks is insecure against targeted DoS attacks that can completely block these shuffling nodes. In this article, we present DAENet , an efficient mix network that resists both targeted DoS attacks and traffic analysis attacks with a new abstraction called Stealthy Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network . The stealthy P2P network effectively hides the shuffling nodes used in a routing path into the whole network, such that adversaries cannot distinguish specific shuffling nodes and conduct targeted DoS attacks to block these nodes. In addition, to handle traffic analysis attacks, we leverage the confidentiality and integrity protection of Intel SGX to ensure trustworthy packet shuffles at each distributed host and use multiple routing paths to prevent adversaries from tracking and revealing user identities. We show that our system is scalable with moderate latency (2.2s) when running in a cluster of 10,000 participants and is robust in the case of machine failures, making it an attractive new design for decentralized anonymous communication. DAENet ’s code is released on https://github.com/hku-systems/DAENet .}

	abstract = {With the rapid advances in computing and information technologies, traditional access control models have become inadequate in terms of capturing fine-grained, and expressive security requirements of newly emerging applications. An attribute-based access control (ABAC) model provides a more flexible approach to addressing the authorization needs of complex and dynamic systems. While organizations are interested in employing newer authorization models, migrating to such models pose as a significant challenge. Many large-scale businesses need to grant authorizations to their user populations that are potentially distributed across disparate and heterogeneous computing environments. Each of these computing environments may have its own access control model. The manual development of a single policy framework for an entire organization is tedious, costly, and error-prone. In this article, we present a methodology for automatically learning ABAC policy rules from access logs of a system to simplify the policy development process. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning-based algorithm for detecting patterns in access logs and extracting ABAC authorization rules from these patterns. In addition, we present two policy improvement algorithms, including rule pruning and policy refinement algorithms to generate a higher quality mined policy. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed approach to demonstrate its feasibility.}

	abstract = {With the widespread use of cloud emails and frequent reports on large-scale email leakage events, a security property so-called forward secrecy becomes desirable and indispensable for both individuals and cloud email service providers to strengthen the security of cloud email systems. Specifically, forward secrecy can guarantee the confidentiality of those previously encrypted emails even if the user’s secret key gets exposed. However, due to the failure to meet the security and practicality requirements of email systems simultaneously, typical methods of achieving forward secrecy, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange and forward-secure public-key encryption, have not been widely approved and adopted. In this article, to capture forward secrecy of encrypted cloud email systems without sacrificing the practicability, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named forward-secure puncturable identity-based encryption (fs-PIBE), which enables an email user to perform fine-grained revocation of decryption capacity. In more detail, the user is allowed to preserve the decryption capacity of unreceived encrypted emails, while abolishing that of those received ones. Thus, it provides more practical forward secrecy than typical manners, in which the decryption capacity of received and unreceived encrypted emails is revoked simultaneously. Based on such a primitive, we build a framework of encrypted cloud email systems, and instantiate it with a concrete fs-PIBE construction that has constant size of ciphertext and provable security in the standard model. Furthermore, to improve the security and efficiency of the presented framework, we extend the proposed fs-PIBE scheme to support end-to-end encryption and outsourced decryption, respectively. In addition, as a proof-of-concept of the proposed fs-PIBE scheme, we implement it and produce various experiments to demonstrate its practicability and correctness.}

	abstract = {Edge computing (EC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing by pushing computing resources onto edge servers that are attached to base stations or access points at the edge of the cloud in close proximity with end-users. Due to edge servers’ geographic distribution, the EC paradigm is challenged by many new security threats, including the notorious distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In the EC environment, edge servers usually have constrained processing capacities due to their limited sizes. Thus, they are particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks in the EC environment render existing DDoS mitigation approaches obsolete with its new characteristics. In this article, we make the first attempt to tackle the edge DDoS mitigation (EDM) problem. We model it as a constraint optimization problem and prove its\nNP\n-hardness. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal approach named EDMOpti and a novel game-theoretical approach named EDMGame for mitigating edge DDoS attacks. EDMGame formulates the EDM problem as a potential EDM Game that admits a Nash equilibrium and employs a decentralized algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium as the solution to the EDM problem. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our approaches can solve the EDM problem effectively and efficiently.}

	abstract = {Trojan attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) exploit a backdoor embedded in a DNN model that can hijack any input with an attacker’s chosen signature trigger. Emerging defence mechanisms are mainly designed and validated on vision domain tasks (e.g., image classification) on 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architectures; a defence mechanism that is general across vision, text, and audio domain tasks is demanded. This work designs and evaluates a run-time Trojan detection method exploiting STR ong I ntentional P erturbation of inputs that is a multi-domain input-agnostic Trojan detection defence across Vi sion, T ext and A udio domains—thus termed as STRIP-ViTA. Specifically, STRIP-ViTA is demonstratively independent of not only task domain but also model architectures. Most importantly, unlike other detection mechanisms, it requires neither machine learning expertise nor expensive computational resource, which are the reason behind DNN model outsourcing scenario—one main attack surface of Trojan attack. We have extensively evaluated the performance of STRIP-ViTA over: i) CIFAR10 and GTSRB datasets using 2D CNNs for vision tasks; ii) IMDB and consumer complaint datasets using both LSTM and 1D CNNs for text tasks; and iii) speech command dataset using both 1D CNNs and 2D CNNs for audio tasks. Experimental results based on more than 30 tested Trojaned models (including publicly Trojaned model) corroborate that STRIP-ViTA performs well across all nine architectures and five datasets. Overall, STRIP-ViTA can effectively detect trigger inputs with small false acceptance rate (FAR) with an acceptable preset false rejection rate (FRR). In particular, for vision tasks, we can always achieve a 0 percent FRR and FAR given strong attack success rate always preferred by the attacker. By setting FRR to be 3 percent, average FAR of 1.1 and 3.55 percent are achieved for text and audio tasks, respectively.

	abstract = {A mathematical framework to reason about time resilience in cybersecurity is here introduced. We first consider an attacker who is able to mount several multi-stage attacks on the organization: the defender’s objective is to select an optimal portfolio of security controls, within a given budget, to withstand the highest number of attacks. The mathematical model is a Markov chain with an initial state called the safe state, intermediate states for all possible attacks (each attack state denoting a probabilistic attack graph), and a sink state denoting a successful attack. The overall defence problem is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective optimization, i.e., the defender selects an optimal portfolio of security controls to mitigate an optimal attacker. In order to determine the probability of success of an attack two cases will be considered: (a) the expected probability of success and (b) the highest probability of success. We refer to these two cases as expected-time analysis and worst-case time analysis, respectively. To solve precisely these bi-level optimizations strong duality and Mixed Integer Linear Programming are used. We then extend the framework to investigate resilience in terms of the total duration of the attacks; variations of the previous optimizations are presented to this purpose. Finally numerical evaluations are provided to compare the results obtained from the expected-time analysis and the worst-case time analysis.}

	abstract = {RFID technology is increasingly used in various areas of society, where privacy plays a critical role. Due to this aspect, a sustained effort has been devoted in recent years to develop privacy models for RFID systems. Two widely accepted such models are Vaudenay’s model and the HPVP model. An incursion into the broad diversity of the RFID schemes developed so far shows that many of them do not assure privacy in any of the two models. That is either due to design errors or because their authors did not run any privacy analysis or have used weaker ad hoc privacy models. This article presents five design scenarios underlying constructions of RFID schemes that cannot provide certain levels of privacy in any of the two models. Each scenario is richly exemplified by RFID schemes proposed in the literature, and it is concluded by a lesson to guide us to a better design of such schemes.}

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateways connected to the Internet are often based on conventional operating systems such as Linux and on conventional communication protocols such as HTTPS and therefore are valuable targets for malicious attackers. When compromised, a malicious IIoT gateway can interfere with data exchanged between IIoT devices and systems running on servers or the Cloud. The Gateway Integrity Checking Protocol (GIP), proposed in previous work, defines a gossip mechanism to collect data from sets of IIoT devices to respond to security challenges issued by an External Security Agent (ESA) to assess a gateway's trustworthiness. GIP relies on a secure channel between IIoT devices and the ESA, which is achieved using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for message authentication and encryption. In this article, we perform an analysis of the security measures employed by GIP, using formal descriptions to demonstrate that GIP is no less secure than the hash algorithm and the public key infrastructure used. Additionally, we simulate different configurations of GIP to measure detection rate and time to detect integrity faults.}

	abstract = {Cost assignment plays a key role in coding performance and security of video steganography. Existing cost assignment methods (for adaptive video steganography) are designed for specific transform coefficients rather than all transform coefficients. In addition, existing video steganographic frameworks do not allow Syndrome-Trellis Codes (STCs) to modify all transform coefficients in both intra-coded and inter-coded frames at the same time. To address these limitations, in this article, we first propose a novel video steganographic framework. Then, we give a theoretical analysis of distortion drift in both intra- and inter-coding procedures. Based on the analysis, we design a Distortion Drift-Based Cost Assignment method, hereafter referred to as DDCA. DDCA considers the inner-block, inter-block and inter-frame distortion costs in order to improve the coding performance and the security of stego videos when the embedding payload is fixed. We conducted extensive experiments using two video datasets to evaluate the proposed video steganographic framework and DDCA, in terms of the coding performance and the security. Our experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms three recent state-of-the-art methods, for example the coding performance and the security of stego videos can benefit from DDCA by making full use of all nonzero transform coefficients.}

	abstract = {Introduced less than twenty years ago, cuckoo hashing has a number of attractive features like a constant worst case number of memory accesses for queries and close to full memory utilization. Cuckoo hashing has been widely adopted to perform exact matching of an incoming key with a set of stored (key, value) pairs in both software and hardware implementations. This widespread adoption makes it important to consider the security of cuckoo hashing. Most hash based data structures can be attacked by generating collisions that reduce their performance. In fact, for cuckoo hashing collisions could lead to insertion failures which in some systems would lead to a system failure. For example, if cuckoo hashing is used to perform Ethernet lookup and a given MAC address cannot be added to the cuckoo hash, the switch would not be able to correctly forward frames to that address. Previous works have shown that this can be done when the attacker knows the hash functions used in the implementation. However, in many cases the attacker would not have that information and would only have access to the cuckoo hash operations to perform insertions, removals or queries. This article considers the security of a cuckoo hash to an attacker that has only a black box access to it. The analysis shows that by carefully performing user operations on the cuckoo hash, the attacker can force insertion failures with a small set of elements. The proposed attack has been implemented and tested for different configurations to demonstrate its feasibility. The fact that cuckoo hash can be broken with only access to its user functions should be taken into account when implementing it in critical systems. The article also discusses potential approaches to mitigate this vulnerability.}

	abstract = {Past research has shown that over 8 months may elapse between the time when a network is compromised and the time the attack is discovered. During this long gap, attackers can steal valuable intellectual property from the victim. The recent FORGE system [8] has suggested that automatically generating fake—but believable—versions of documents can delay the attacker, cost him money, and increase his uncertainty. However, in order to generate fakes, FORGE only modifies the textual component of the document in question. But in the real world, documents consist of many non-textual components such as charts, equations, formulas, diagrams, and tables. We propose the concept of a Probabilistic Logic Graph (PLG) and show that PLGs provide a single, unified framework within which the different parts of a document can be expressed. We then define the problem of generating, for a given PLG representation of a document, a set of fake yet highly believable PLGs (i.e., documents), so that an attacker looking at them (both the original and the fake ones) cannot easily identify the original document. We show that the problem of generating fake PLGs is intractable—but we propose an approximation algorithm that solves it efficiently. We evaluate the use of PLGs over a corpus of patents and show that our fakes can effectively deceive an adversary.}

The large number of EVs facilitate development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes two-way electricity flows between EVs and the power grid. How to achieve fairness and privacy for EVs during electricity/service exchanges remains a challenging problem for V2G. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving fair exchange scheme V2GEx for V2G based on the blockchain. V2GEx is composed of an extended blockchain that supports zero-knowledge funds, a fair exchange smart contract based on the hashchain micropayment mechanism, and a privacy-preserving protocol for V2G. We further propose a simpler and more efficient scheme called Uni-V2GEx, which preserves privacy for only one party. We also provide a rigorous security proof under the universal composability (UC) model to prove V2GEx's security. To evaluate its efficiency, we implement V2GEx and conduct comprehensive experiments to test its performance in terms of computation cost and processing delay. The experiment results show that V2GEx is highly efficient in that verification of V2GEx transactions costs only 20 ms and the average transaction processing latency is around 6 seconds in a 200-node blockchain network.}

	abstract = {Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) bind a device's identity to its physical hardware and thus, can be employed for device identification, authentication and cryptographic key generation. However, PUFs are susceptible to modeling attacks if a number of PUFs’ challenge-response pairs (CRPs) are exposed to the adversary. Furthermore, many of the embedded devices requiring authentication and inter-device communication in a real-time environment/system have stringent resource and low latency requirements, and thus require a lightweight authentication and key establishment mechanism to quickly realize an authenticated and secure connection. We propose PUF-RAKE, a PUF-based lightweight, highly reliable authentication and key establishment scheme. The proposed scheme enhances the reliability of PUF as well as alleviates the resource constraints by employing error correction in the server instead of the device as well as removing cryptographic hashing required by earlier PUF-based protocols. The proposed PUF-RAKE is robust against masquerade, brute force, replay, and modeling attacks. In PUF-RAKE, we introduce an inexpensive yet secure stream authentication scheme inside the device which authenticates the server before the underlying PUF can be invoked. This prevents an adversary from brute forcing the device's PUF to acquire CRPs essentially locking out the device from unauthorized model generation. Additionally, we also introduce a lightweight CRP obfuscation mechanism involving XOR and shuffle operations. The security of PUF-RAKE has been formally verified. A prototype of the protocol has been implemented on two Xilinx Zynq 7000 system-on-chips with one present on Xilinx zc706 evaluation board and the other present on the Avnet Zedboard. Observations, security analysis and results verify that the PUF-RAKE is secure against a probabilistic polynomial time adversary under both the unauthenticated link and authenticated link adversarial models while providing ∼99% reliable authentication. In addition, PUF-RAKE provides a reduction of 60 and 72 percent for look-up tables (LUTs) and register count, respectively, in the programmable logic (PL) part of the Zynq 7000 as compared to a recently proposed approach while providing additional advantages.}

To ensure a fine-grained data access control for such data-sharings on untrusted storage (e.g., Cloud), Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a promising tool. To address privacy concerns in such ABE-based access control systems, we propose a new Privacy-preserving Distributed data Access control (PDAC) in CloudIoT. Our PDAC improves the previous privacy-preserving distributed ABE systems in three aspects. The first introduces a new user's anonymity approach against the colluding untrusted (honest-but-curious) authorities. The second presents a novel policy-hiding mechanism that efficiently preserves the privacy of policy-forming attributes (metadata) against colluding parties. The third introduces an independent-authorities system for our privacy-preserving improvements, where an authority can join and leave the system without reinitializing other authorities. Moreover, our PDAC offloads the user's computations over the Cloud servers for efficiency enhancement. We prove the security of our PDAC through formal analysis. Then, we present empirical results on different classes of mobile devices, including a laptop and a smartphone.}

This article proposes a novel EEG fusion method to examine the reliability and durability of EEG biometric markers across recording sessions. Our hypothesis is that models trained using EEG signals collected during various elicitation protocols can capture generalised brain patterns that pertain personalised information which can improve the durability of biometric systems. Different protocols are likely to produce different responses across brain regions, which can result in more identifiable responses from EEG. In our approach, an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model is adopted for feature extraction and classification of raw EEG data. The proposed method is evaluated on two EEG datasets which were collected over two separate sessions on different days using multiple different EEG elicitation protocols. Within-session and across-session experiments were conducted. Results for within session experiments showed that CNN models with protocol fusion can achieve similar if not better results than models trained with single protocol. In across-session scenarios, models trained with the proposed protocol fusion approach significantly outperformed single protocol based models. The obtained results illustrate the durability and reliability capabilities of the proposed fusion approach.}

	abstract = {Similarity query over time series data plays a significant role in various applications, such as signal processing, speech recognition, and disease diagnosis. Meanwhile, driven by the reliable and flexible cloud services, encrypted time series data are often outsourced to the cloud, and as a result, the similarity query over encrypted time series data has recently attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, existing solutions still have issues in supporting similarity queries over time series data with different lengths, query accuracy and query efficiency. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving similarity range query scheme, where the time warp edit distance (TWED) is used as the similarity metric. Specifically, we first organize time series data into a\nk\nd-tree by leveraging TWED’s triangle inequality, and design an efficient similarity range query algorithm for the\nk\nd-tree. Second, based on a symmetric homomorphic encryption technique, we carefully devise a suite of privacy-preserving protocols to provide a security guarantee for\nk\nd-tree based similarity range queries. After that, by using the similarity range query algorithm and these protocols, we propose our privacy-preserving similarity range query scheme, in which we elaborate on two strategies to make our scheme resist against the cloud inference attack. Finally, we analyze the security of our scheme and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance, and the results indicate that our proposed scheme is indeed privacy-preserving and efficient.}

	abstract = {The multi-tenancy in a cloud along with its dynamic and self-service nature could cause severe security concerns, such as isolation breaches among cloud tenants. To mitigate such concerns and ensure the accountability and transparency of the cloud providers towards their tenants, verifying cloud states against a list of security policies, a.k.a. security auditing , is a promising solution. However, the existing security auditing solutions for clouds suffer from several limitations. First, the traditional auditing approach, which is retroactive in nature, can only detect violations after the fact and hence, often becomes ineffective while dealing with the dynamic nature of a cloud. Second, the existing runtime approaches can cause significant delay in the response time while dealing with the sheer size of a cloud. Finally, the current proactive approaches typically rely on prior knowledge about future changes in a cloud and also require significant manual efforts, and thus become less practical for a dynamic environment like cloud. To address those limitations, we present a novel proactive security auditing system, namely, ProSAS , which can prevent violations to security policies at runtime with a practical response time, and yet does not require prior knowledge about future changes. More specifically, ProSAS first establishes its models (e.g., dependency relationships between cloud events, and critical events) through learning from historical data (e.g., logs); it then predicts future critical events which would likely follow a received event by leveraging the dependency relationships; afterwards, it proactively verifies the impacts of those future events, and prevents those events which can cause violations of security policies. ProSAS is integrated into OpenStack, a popular cloud management platform, and we provide a concrete guideline to port ProSAS to other popular cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon EC2. Our experiment results using both real and synthetic data demonstrate the improvement of efficiency (i.e., reducing response time to 1,450 nanoseconds at best and 8.5 milliseconds on average for a large-scale cloud with 10,000 tenants) and level of automation (i.e., learning more than 20 new critical events spanning 100 days) in proactive security auditing by ProSAS.}

	abstract = {Database management systems (DBMS) are one of cloud services with major applications in industry and business. In the use of such services, since the cloud service provider cannot be entrusted with the plain data, the databases are typically encrypted prior to outsourcing. One of the most challenging issues in designing these services is supporting SQL join queries on the encrypted database. The multi-adjustable join scheme (M-Adjoin) [Khazaei-Rafiee 2020], an extension of Adjoin [Popa-Zeldovich 2012 and Mironov-Segev-Shahaf 2017], is a symmetric-key primitive that supports the join queries for a list of column labels on an encrypted database. In previous works, the following security notions were introduced for\nAdjoin\nand\nM-Adjoin\nschemes:\n3Partition\n,\nM3Partition\nand\nM3P\nk\n, for every integer\nk\n. In this article, we first extend the simulation-based and indistinguishability-based security notions for\nAdjoin\n, defined by Mironov et al. , to\nM-Adjoin\n. Then, we study the relations between all these security notions for\nM-Adjoin\n. In particular, some non-trivial relations are proved which resolve some open problems raised by Mironov et al.}

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are being increasingly used in safety-critical and high-performance computing systems. As such systems require high levels of resilience to errors, CNNs must execute correctly in the presence of hardware faults. Full duplication provides the needed assurance but incurs a prohibitive 100 percent overhead. In this article, we focus on algorithmically verifying convolutions, the most resource-demanding operations in CNNs. We use checksums to verify convolutions. We identify the feasibility and performance related challenges that arise in algorithmically detecting errors in convolutions in optimized CNN inference deployment platforms (e.g., TensorFlow or TensorRT on GPUs) that fuse multiple network layers and use reduced-precision operations, and demonstrate how to overcome them. We propose and evaluate variations of the algorithm-based error detection (ABED) techniques that offer implementation complexity, runtime overhead, and coverage trade-offs. Results show that ABED can detect all transient hardware errors that might otherwise corrupt output with low runtime overheads (6-23 percent). Only about 1.4 percent of the total computations in a CNN are not protected by ABED, which can be duplicated for full CNN protection. ABED for the compute-intensive convolutions and duplicating the rest can offer at least 1.6× throughput compared to full duplication.}

	abstract = {Stack-based memory corruption vulnerabilities have been exploited, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code and read/write arbitrary memory. Although several solutions have been proposed to prevent memory errors on the stack, they are either limited to a specific type of attack (either spatial or temporal attacks) or cause significant performance degradation. In this article, we introduce SaVioR, an efficient and comprehensive stack protection mechanism. The key technique involves randomization of the stack layout to reduce its predictability and exploitability. SaVioR isolates an individual object from spatially and temporally adjacent vulnerable objects and randomizes each object's location, which prevents attackers from predicting the stack layout and thus reduces the likelihood of memory errors being exploited. We implemented SaVioR based on the LLVM compiler framework and applied it to the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and real-world applications. Our security evaluation showed that SaVioR provides a high degree of randomness in the stack layout and thus reduces the likelihood of successful exploitation of spatial and temporal memory errors on the stack. Our performance evaluation also demonstrated that it incurs a modest performance overhead (14 percent) with the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite, which improves performance compared to the state-of-the-art stack protection while achieving a comparable security level.}

	abstract = {Information hiding (IH) is an important building block for many defenses against code reuse attacks, such as code-pointer integrity (CPI), control-flow integrity (CFI) and fine-grained code (re-)randomization, because of its effectiveness and performance. It employs randomization to probabilistically “hide” sensitive memory areas, called safe areas, from attackers and ensures their addresses are not leaked by any pointers directly. These defenses used safe areas to protect their critical data, such as jump targets and randomization secrets. However, recent works have shown that IH is vulnerable to various attacks. In this article, we propose a new IH technique called SafeHidden. It continuously re-randomizes the locations of safe areas and thus prevents the attackers from probing and inferring the memory layout to find its location. A new thread-private memory mechanism is proposed to isolate the thread-local safe areas and prevent adversaries from reducing the randomization entropy. It also randomizes the safe areas after the TLB misses to prevent attackers from inferring the address of safe areas using cache side-channels. Existing IH-based defenses can utilize SafeHidden directly without any change. Our experiments show that SafeHidden not only prevents existing attacks effectively but also incurs low performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Intel SGX has started to be widely adopted. Cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud) are offering new solutions, implementing data-in-use protection via SGX. A major challenge faced by both academia and industry is providing transparent SGX support to legacy applications. The approach with the highest consensus is linking the target software with SGX-extended libc libraries. Unfortunately, the increased security entails a dramatic performance penalty, which is mainly due to the intrinsic overhead of context switches, and the limited size of protected memory. Performance optimization is non-trivial since it depends on key parameters whose manual tuning is a very long process. We present the architecture of an automated tool, called SGXTuner , which is able to find the best setting of SGX-extended libc library parameters, by iteratively adjusting such parameters based on continuous monitoring of performance data. The tool is — to a large extent — algorithm agnostic. We decided to base the current implementation on a particular type of stochastic optimization algorithm, specifically Simulated Annealing . A massive experimental campaign was conducted on a relevant case study. Three client-server applications — Memcached , Redis , and Apache — were compiled with SCONE's sgx-musl and tuned for best performance. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SGXTuner .}

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) advances the adoption of composable software middleboxes. Accordingly, cloud data centres become major NFV vendors for enterprise traffic processing. Due to the privacy concern of traffic redirection to the cloud, secure middlebox systems (e.g., BlindBox) draw much attention; they can process encrypted packets against encrypted rules directly. However, most of the existing systems supporting pattern matching based network functions require the enterprise gateway to tokenise packet payloads via sliding windows. Such tokenisation induces a considerable communication overhead, which can be over 100× to the packet size. To overcome this bottleneck, in this article, we propose the first bandwidth-efficient encrypted pattern matching protocol for secure middleboxes. We resort to a primitive called symmetric hidden vector encryption (SHVE), and propose a variant of it, aka SHVE+, to achieve constant and moderate communication cost. To speed up, we devise encrypted filters to reduce the number of accesses to SHVE+ during matching highly. We formalise the security of our proposed protocol and conduct comprehensive evaluations over real-world rulesets and traffic dumps. The results show that our design can inspect a packet over 20 k rules within 100\nμ\ns. Compared to prior work, it brings a saving of 94 percent in bandwidth consumption.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of user data, recommenders have become increasingly complicated. State-of-the-art algorithms often have high computational complexity and heavily use non-linear transformations. This fact makes the privacy-preserving problem more challenging, despite the significant advances in cryptography. To alleviate this problem, we propose a privacy-friendly recommender, CryptoRec. It only relies on additions and multiplications, which are efficiently supported by most cryptographic primitives. Different from others, in CryptoRec, the parameter space only contains item features (user features can be directly computed from the item features). This property allows CryptoRec to, (1) naturally achieve transferability if two datasets share the same item entries, which can benefit differential privacy protection; (2) directly estimate the preference of new users whose data is not included in the training set, drastically improving recommendation efficiency. We first evaluate CryptoRec on three real-world datasets. The evaluation results show that the accuracy is competitive with state-of-the-art. Then, we build differential privacy into CryptoRec and leverage its transferability property to reduce the overall privacy loss. Lastly, we demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of using CryptoRec to construct secure recommendation protocols based on homomorphic encryption schemes. Our results show that CryptoRec outperforms existing solutions in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.}

Due to the ease of use, it has great potential to be widely deployed for web-service authentication in the near future whereby people can easily log on to online accounts from different devices without memorizing lengthy passwords. However, the growing number of attacks on machine learning especially the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) which is commonly used for facial recognition, imposes big challenges on the successful roll-out of such web-service face authentication. Although there have been studies on defending some machine learning attacks, we are not aware of any specific effort devoted to the web-service facial authentication setting. In this article, we first demonstrate a new data poisoning attack that does not require to have any knowledge of the server-side and just needs a handful of malicious photo injections to enable an attacker to easily impersonate the victim in the existing facial authentication systems. We then propose a novel defensive approach called DEFEAT that leverages deep learning techniques to automatically detect such attacks. We have conducted extensive experiments on real datasets and our experimental results show that our defensive approach achieves more than 90 percent detection accuracy.}

This has unfortunately given birth to a new form of Internet fraud, which we refer to as “app distribution fraud”. This new fraud involves collusion between ISPs and fraudulent app distributors where app download is hijacked/redirected. In this article, we have the unique opportunity to cooperate with a major e-commerce company (with about 0.2 billion active users per month) to take a first peek at this problem. Through the nationwide measurement results, we find that app distribution fraud is ubiquitous yet stealthy — about 1.55 percent app downloads are hijacked/redirected, affecting more than 75 percent of the cities we tested and causing an estimated 7.46 billion U.S. dollars financial loss per year. We follow up with additional measurements on the technical mechanism of the fraud and the scope of the fraud (i.e., what other apps are also affected). Surprisingly, we find that sometimes the original app a user intends to download can be replaced with a completely different app, rendering the user's device at risks.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the security of automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is facing urgent threats due to the widespread use of legacy in-vehicle communication systems. As a representative legacy bus system, the Controller Area Network (CAN) hosts Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that are crucial for the vehicles functioning. In this scenario, malicious actors can exploit the CAN vulnerabilities, such as the lack of built-in authentication and encryption schemes, to launch CAN bus attacks (e.g., suspension, injection, and masquerade attacks) with life-threatening consequences (e.g., disabling brakes). In this article, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs on the legacy CAN bus by exploiting the covert channels , without introducing CAN protocol modifications or traffic overheads (no extra bits or CAN messages are used). TACAN turns upside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter authentication via a centralized, trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based, leveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) the Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing authentication messages into the LSBs of normal CAN data; and 3) a hybrid covert channel, exploiting the combination of the first two. In order to validate TACAN, we implement the covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR (Chevrolet Camaro 2016) testbed. We further evaluate the bit error, throughput, and detection performance of TACAN through extensive experiments using the EcoCAR testbed and a publicly available dataset collected from Toyota Camry 2010. We demonstrate the feasibility of TACAN and the effectiveness of detecting CAN bus attacks, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the regular functionality of ECUs.}

Though there are some protection options such as differential privacy (DP) and monitoring, which are considered promising techniques to mitigate this attack, we still find that the vulnerability persists. In this article, we propose an adaptive query-flooding parameter duplication (QPD) attack. The adversary can infer the model information with black-box access and no prior knowledge of any model parameters or training data via QPD. We also develop a defense strategy using DP called monitoring-based DP (MDP) against this new attack. In MDP, we first propose a novel real-time model extraction status assessment scheme called Monitor to evaluate the situation of the model. Then, we design a method to guide the differential privacy budget allocation called APBA adaptively. Finally, all DP-based defenses with MDP could dynamically adjust the amount of noise added in the model response according to the result from Monitor and effectively defends the QPD attack. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and compare the QPD attack and MDP defense performance on real-world models with DP and monitoring protection.}

	abstract = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) is the de-facto communication standard used by vessels to broadcast identification and position information. However, being AIS communications neither encrypted nor authenticated, they can be eavesdropped and spoofed by adversaries, leading to potentially threatening scenarios. Existing solutions, including the ones conceived in the avionics domain, do not consider integration with the AIS standard, and they do not provide protection against rogue messages flooding. In this article, we propose Auth-AIS, a secure, flexible, standard-compliant, and backward-compatible authentication framework to secure AIS broadcast messages. Auth-AIS leverages existing sound cryptographic tools, including TESLA and Bloom Filters, inheriting their security properties while contextualizing them in the AIS technology. Auth-AIS is a software-only solution, that can be seamlessly integrated into existing AIS deployments, without requiring any hardware replacement. Its innovative design also provides backward-compatibility—i.e., Auth-AIS messages can be received also by AIS users not adopting Auth-AIS, while renouncing at its security guarantees. Auth-AIS can work in either two configuration modes: Deterministic Security Configuration, able to achieve low-delay authentication with a message overhead of 75 percent, or Probabilistic Security Configuration, reducing the message overhead down to 35.71 percent, while experiencing a marginal increase in the authentication delay. All these security configurations guarantee an 80 bits equivalent security level and false-positive rate less than 2 --40 . Note that these latter security parameters can easily be tuned to fit different security requirements. Finally, the source code of Auth-AIS in the GNURadio ecosystem has been released as open-source, to foster research activities from both Industry and Academia on secure AIS communications.}

	abstract = {It is observed that modern vehicles are becoming more and more powerful in computing, communications, and storage capacity. By interacting with other vehicles or with local infrastructures (i.e., fog) such as road-side units, vehicles and fog devices can collaboratively provide services like crowdsensing in an efficient and secure way. Unfortunately, it is hard to develop a secure and privacy-preserving crowdsensing report deduplication mechanism in such a system. In this article, we propose a scheme FVC-Dedup to address this challenge. Specifically, we develop cryptographic primitives to realize secure task allocation and guarantee the confidentiality of crowdsensing reports. During the report submission, we improve the message-lock encryption (MLE) scheme to realize privacy-preserving report deduplication and resist the fake duplicate attacks. Besides, we construct a novel signature scheme to achieve efficient signature aggregation and record the contributions of each participant fairly without knowing the crowdsensing data. The security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that FVC-Dedup can achieve secure and privacy-preserving report deduplication with moderate computing and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Facing big network traffic data, effective data compression becomes crucially important and urgently needed for estimating host cardinalities and identifying super hosts. However, the current literature confronts several challenges: incapability of simultaneously measuring various types of host cardinalities and inability to efficiently reconstruct super host addresses. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel sketch data structure, named SuperSketch, to simultaneously measure multiple types of host cardinalities with the purpose of efficiently identifying super hosts. SuperSketch has two significant characteristics: multi-dimensionality and reversibility. The multi-dimensionality makes SuperSketch capable of simultaneously measuring Source Cardinality, Destination Cardinality, and Destination Port Cardinality. The reversibility allows SuperSketch to accurately and quickly reconstruct the original addresses of super hosts once they are identified. We conduct both theoretical analysis and performance evaluation based on real-world network traffic. Experimental results show that SuperSketch achieves outstanding performance for multi-cardinality measurement, super host identification, and host address reconstruction.}

	abstract = {While distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are easy to launch and are becoming more damaging, the defense against DDoS attacks often suffers from the lack of relevant knowledge of the DDoS traffic, including the paths the DDoS traffic has used, the source addresses (spoofed or not) that appear along each path, and the amount of traffic per path or per source. Though IP traceback and path inference approaches could be considered, they are either expensive and hard to deploy or inaccurate. We propose PathFinder, a service that a DDoS defense system can use to obtain the footprints of the DDoS traffic to the victim. PathFinder employs an architecture that is easy to implement and deploy on today's Internet, a PFTrie data structure that introduces multiple design features to log traffic at line rate, and streaming and zooming mechanisms that facilitates the storage and transmission of DDoS footprints more efficiently. Our evaluation shows that PathFinder can significantly improve the efficacy of a DDoS defense system, its PFTrie data structure is fast and has a manageable overhead, and its streaming and zooming mechanisms significantly reduce the delay and overhead in transmitting DDoS footprints.}

	abstract = {Increasing affordability of genome sequencing and, as a consequence, widespread availability of genomic data opens up new opportunities for the field of medicine, as also evident from the emergence of popular cloud-based offerings in this area, such as Google Genomics [1]. To utilize this data more efficiently, it is crucial that different entities share their data with each other. However, such data sharing is risky mainly due to privacy concerns. In this article, we attempt to provide a privacy-preserving and efficient solution for the “similar patient search” problem among several parties (e.g., hospitals) by addressing the shortcomings of previous attempts. We consider a scenario in which each hospital has its own genomic dataset and the goal of a physician (or researcher) is to search for a patient similar to a given one (based on a genomic makeup) among all the hospitals in the system. To enable this search, we propose a hierarchical index structure to index each hospital’s dataset with low memory requirement. Furthermore, we develop a novel privacy-preserving index merging mechanism that generates a common search index from individual indices of each hospital to significantly improve the search efficiency. We also consider the storage of medical information associated with genomic data of a patient (e.g., diagnosis and treatment). We allow access to this information via a fine-grained access control policy that we develop through the combination of standard symmetric encryption and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption. Using this mechanism, a physician can search for similar patients and obtain medical information about the matching records if the access policy holds. We conduct experiments on large-scale genomic data and show the high efficiency of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Training complex neural network models using third-party cloud-based infrastructure among multiple data sources is a promising approach among existing machine learning solutions. However, privacy concerns of large-scale data collections and recent regulations have restricted the availability and use of privacy sensitive data in the third-party infrastructure. To address such privacy issues, a promising emerging approach is to train a neural network model over an encrypted dataset. Specifically, the model training process can be outsourced to a third party such as a cloud service that is backed by significant computing power, while the encrypted training data keeps the data confidential from the third party. Compared to training a traditional machine learning model over encrypted data, however, it is extremely challenging to train a deep neural network (DNN) model over encrypted data for two reasons: first, it requires large-scale computation over huge datasets; second, the existing solutions for computation over encrypted data, such as using homomorphic encryption, is inefficient. Further, for enhanced performance of a DNN model, we also need to use huge training datasets composed of data from multiple data sources that may not have pre-established trust relationships among each other. We propose a novel framework, NN-EMD , to train DNN over encrypted multiple datasets collected from multiple sources. Toward this, we propose a set of secure computation protocols using hybrid functional encryption schemes. We evaluate our framework for performance with regards to the training time and model accuracy on the MNIST datasets. We show that compared to other existing frameworks, our proposed NN-EMD framework can significantly reduce the training time, while providing comparable model accuracy and privacy guarantees as well as supporting multiple data sources. Furthermore, the depth and complexity of neural networks do not affect the training time despite introducing a privacy-preserving NN-EMD setting.}

However, existing vulnerability detectors still cannot achieve the vulnerability detection capability and the locating precision that would warrant their adoption for real-world use. In this article, we present a vulnerability detector that can simultaneously achieve a high detection capability and a high locating precision, dubbed Vul nerability Dee p learning-based Locator (VulDeeLocator). In the course of designing VulDeeLocator, we encounter difficulties including how to accommodate semantic relations between the definitions of types as well as macros and their uses across files, how to accommodate accurate control flows and variable define-use relations, and how to achieve high locating precision. We solve these difficulties by using two innovative ideas: (i) leveraging intermediate code to accommodate extra semantic information, and (ii) using the notion of granularity refinement to pin down locations of vulnerabilities. When applied to 200 files randomly selected from three real-world software products, VulDeeLocator detects 18 confirmed vulnerabilities (i.e., true-positives). Among them, 16 vulnerabilities correspond to known vulnerabilities; the other two are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) but have been “silently” patched by the vendor of Libav when releasing newer versions.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of cloud storage, increasing users begin to outsource data to the cloud. In order to resist possible data analysis for centralized outsourced data and improve the fault tolerance, users prefer to distribute data to cloud servers of different cloud service providers. However, once the data have been outsourced, it will be out of user’s control and many security issues may occur, such as outsourced data being illegally tamper with, or rarely accessed data being secretly deleted. In this article, we propose a decentralized self-auditing scheme for multi-cloud storage, called DSAS. First, based on the symmetric balanced incomplete block design, DSAS achieves integrity verification for outsourced data via the interactions of cloud servers and the auditing costs are shared by the participating CSs. Second, DSAS can locate misbehavior cloud server with low computation costs, and resist denial of service attack initiated by malicious cloud servers which attempts to destroy the audit. Third, DSAS can recover the corrupted data without fetching data, and support the revocation of cloud servers and batch auditing. Finally, security proof and function evaluation show that DSAS has comprehensive security and functionality, and performance simulations and experiment results show that DSAS is efficient.}

	abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol supporting name resolution from Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to the IP address of the machines corresponding to them. This resolution process is critical to the operation of the Internet, but is susceptible to a range of attacks. One of the most dangerous attack vectors is DNS poisoning where an attacker injects malicious entries into the DNS resolution forcing clients to be redirected from legitimate to malicious servers. Typically, poisoning attacks target a DNS resolver allowing attackers to poison a DNS entry for all machines that use the compromised resolver. However, recent defenses protect resolvers substantially limiting these attacks. In this paper, we present a new class of DNS poisoning attacks targeting the client-side DNS cache, which is used in mainstream operating systems, circumventing defenses protecting resolvers. We implemented the attack on Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu Linux machines. We also generalize the attack to work even when the client is behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router. Our results show that we can reliably inject malicious DNS mappings, with on average, an order of tens of seconds. We also propose client-side mitigations and demonstrate that they can effectively mitigate the vulnerability.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables enterprises and individuals to outsource and share their data. This way, cloud computing eliminates the heavy workload of local information infrastructure. Attribute-based encryption has become a promising solution for encrypted data access control in clouds due to the ability to achieve one-to-many encrypted data sharing. Revocation is a critical requirement for encrypted data access control systems. After outsourcing the encrypted attribute-based ciphertext to the cloud, the data owner may want to revoke some recipients that were authorized previously, which means that the outsourced attribute-based ciphertext needs to be updated to a new one that is under the revoked policy. The integrity issue arises when the revocation is executed. When a new ciphertext with the revoked access policy is generated by the cloud server, the data recipient cannot be sure that the newly generated ciphertext guarantees to be decrypted to the same plaintext as the originally encrypted data, since the cloud server is provided by a third party, which is not fully trusted. In this article, we consider a new security requirement for the revocable attribute-based encryption schemes: integrity. We introduce a formal definition and security model for the revocable attribute-based encryption with data integrity protection (RABE-DI). Then, we propose a concrete RABE-DI scheme and prove its confidentiality and integrity under the defined security model. Finally, we present an implementation result and provide performance evaluation which shows that our scheme is efficient and practical.}

However, current permission model on Android cannot constrain the behaviors of in-app third-party libraries for allowing them to operate with the same permissions as their host app. This brings serious security and privacy concerns to users. In this article, we propose LibCapsule , a user-level solution to confine third-party libraries from potential permission abuses. Compared to previous systems, LibCapsule is able to provide complete confinement of third-party libraries in Android apps, including the static Java code, dynamically loaded code and native code of third-party libraries. We have developed a prototype of LibCapsule , and collected 204 popular third-party libraries as well as 2,021 apps to evaluate it. The evaluation results indicate that LibCapsule is capable of enforcing complete and fine-grained regulation on third-party libraries according to customized security policies with a low performance overhead. To engage the whole community, we will release the dataset of third-party libraries and apps in our evaluation.}

The end-to-end packet processing induced by virtual network functions (VNFs) like stateless firewall, load balancer, intrusion detection, and prevention system (IDPS) in a network involves the processing of network traffic through security policies matching the traffic pattern defined in security rules of individual VNF. The conflicting rules in terms of traffic match and conflicting actions can lead to a) violation of security requirements (authentication and authorization bypass) b) mission requirements - the presence of redundant rules (increased latency, reduced throughput). We present a new object-oriented policy conflict detection and resolution framework (OOPC), which analyzes the rule dependency relationships between the rules of heterogeneous virtual network functions (VNFs) and creates a VNF-Graph. The rules are analyzed using object-oriented dependencies between the address space and actions of VNF rules. OOPC utilizes a compact VNF-Graph, which leads to a reduction in search complexity when analyzing new security policies. Our security policy composition in our framework OOPC achieves 37 percent lower latency in policy graph composition than previous work.

	abstract = {To manage outsourced encrypted data sharing in clouds, attribute-based proxy re-encryption (ABPRE) has become an elegant primitive. In ABPRE, a cloud server can transform an original recipient’s ciphertext to a new one of a shared user’s. As the transformation is computation consuming, a malicious cloud server may return an incorrect re-encrypted ciphertext to save its computation resources. Moreover, a shared user may accuse the cloud server of returning an incorrect re-encrypted ciphertext to refuse to pay the cost of using the cloud service. However, existing ABPRE schemes do not support a mechanism to achieve verifiability and fairness. In this article, a novel verifiable and fair attribute-based proxy re-encryption (VF-ABPRE) scheme is introduced to support verifiability and fairness. The verifiability enables a shared user to verify whether the re-encrypted ciphertext returned by the server is correct and the fairness ensures a cloud server escape from malicious accusation if it has indeed conducted the re-encryption operation honestly. Additionally, we conduct a performance experiment to show the efficiency and practicality of the new VF-ABPRE scheme.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications build upon resource-constrained, distributed devices that generate data and enable communication. For such applications to be truly trustworthy, it must be ensured that the devices are not compromised by malicious software. Remote attestation (RA), a prominent technique, exploits challenge-response protocols to detect malware on remote devices. Given the increasing scale and number of IoT deployments, recent work on RA has explored collective attestation of swarms of devices. However state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques require trusted hardware which makes them inapplicable to both legacy and next generation IoT deployments without trusted hardware. We present SWARNA, a software-based swarm attestation for IoT devices. After highlighting the challenges in designing such a solution, we present two protocol variants for IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH networks. We assess their performance analytically and empirically through testbed experiments. SWARNA maintains a constant payload size whereas, it increases linearly with the network size for existing solutions requiring trusted hardware. The two protocol variants attest 30 nodes networks, in 6s and 1.5s to 8.2s, respectively, depending on the number of malicious nodes. Further, we demonstrate that attestation traffic has a negligible impact on the packet delivery ratio (0.4 percent drop) of a typical data collection application.}

	abstract = {Deterministic Wallet (DW) and Stealth Address (SA) mechanisms have been widely adopted in the cryptocurrency community, due to their virtues on functionality and privacy protection, which come from a key derivation mechanism that allows an arbitrary number of derived keys to be generated from a master key. However, these algorithms suffer a vulnerability that, when one derived key is compromised somehow, the damage is not limited to the leaked derived key only, but to the master key and in consequence all derived keys are compromised. In this article, we introduce and formalize a new signature variant, called Key-Insulated and Privacy-Preserving Signature Scheme with Publicly Derived Public Key (PDPKS), which fully captures and improves the functionality, security, and privacy requirements of DW and SA. We propose a PDPKS construction and prove its security and privacy in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we implement the construction with parameters for 128-bit security, and the results show that it is practically efficient for the setting of cryptocurrencies. With its solid guarantee on functionality, security and privacy, as well as its practical efficiency, our PDPKS construction provides a practical cryptographic tool that refines DW and SA, without security vulnerability.}

	abstract = {The edge computing paradigm extends cloud computing with storage and processing capacity close to the edge of the network, which can be materialized by using many fog nodes placed in multiple geographic locations. Fog nodes are likely to be vulnerable to tampering, so it is important to protect the functions they provide from attacks. A key building block of many distributed applications is an ordering service that keeps track of cause-effect dependencies among events and that allows events to be processed in an order that respects causality. This article presents the design and implementation of a secure event ordering service for fog nodes. Our service, named Omega, leverages the availability of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), based on SGX technology, to offer fog clients guarantees regarding the order in which events are applied and served, even when fog nodes are compromised. We have also built OmegaKV, a key-value store that uses Omega to offer causal consistency. Experimental results show that the ordering service can be secured without violating the latency constraints of time-sensitive edge applications, despite the overhead associated with using a TEE. Omega introduces an additional latency of approximately 4ms, that contrary to cloud based solutions, allows latency values in the 5ms-30ms range, as required by time-sensitive edge applications.}

	abstract = {Web3.0\n, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate\nWeb3.0\nfrom the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for\nWeb3.0\n. Our definition is not the only way of understanding\nWeb3.0\n, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of\nWeb3.0\n, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for\nWeb3.0\n: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for\nWeb3.0\napplications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable\nWeb3.0\n, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely\nHyperService\n, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers.\nHyperService\nis powered by two innovative designs:\n(i)\na developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and\n(ii)\na secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of\nHyperService\nin approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.}

	abstract = {Text has become one of the most extensively used digital media in Internet, which provides steganography an effective carrier to realize confidential message hiding. Nowadays, generation-based linguistic steganography has made a significant breakthrough due to the progress of deep learning. However, previous methods based on recurrent neural network have two deviations including exposure bias and embedding deviation, which seriously destroys the security of steganography. In this article, we propose a novel linguistic steganographic model based on adaptive probability distribution and generative adversarial network, which achieves the goal of hiding secret messages in the generated text while guaranteeing high security performance. First, the steganographic generator is trained by using generative adversarial network to effectively tackle the exposure bias, and then the candidate pool is obtained by a probability similarity function at each time step, which alleviates the embedding deviation through dynamically maintaining the diversity of probability distribution. Third, to further improve the security, a novel strategy that conducts information embedding during model training is put forward. We design various experiments from different aspects to verify the performance of the proposed model, including imperceptibility, statistical distribution, anti-steganalysis ability. demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art steganographic schemes.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing has become an essential means of finding software bugs. Bug finding through fuzzing requires two parts—exploring code paths to reach bugs and exposing bugs when they are reached. Existing fuzzing research has primarily focused on improving code coverage but not on exposing bugs. Sanitizers such as AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and MemorySanitizer (MSAN) have been the dominating tools for exposing bugs. However, sanitizer-based bug exposing has the following limitations. (1) sanitizers are not compatible with each other. (2) sanitizers incur significant runtime overhead. (3) sanitizers may generate false positives, and (4) exposed bugs may not be exploitable. To address these limitations, we propose Expozzer , a fuzzing system that can expose bugs comprehensively, efficiently, and faithfully. The intuition of Expozzer is to detect bugs through divergences in a properly diversified dual-execution environment, which does not require maintaining or checking execution metadata. We design a practical and deterministic dual-execution engine, a co-design for dual-execution and fuzzers, bug-sensitive diversification, comprehensive, and efficient divergence detection to ensure the effectiveness of Expozzer . The results of evaluations show that Expozzer can detect not only CVE-assigned vulnerabilities reliably, but also new vulnerabilities in well-tested real-world programs. Expozzer is 10 times faster than MemorySanitizer and is similar to AddressSanitizer.}

We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of GM2 and HararyPT with regards to overlay quality under representative pub/sub workloads. GM2 outputs\n2TCO\nwith an empirically insignificant increase in the average node degree, e.g., an increase by 4 in a 1000-node network, as compared to the baseline\n1TCO\nproduced by the best-known algorithm.

	abstract = {Cloud storage services allow data owners to outsource their potentially sensitive data (e.g., private genome data) to remote cloud servers in a ciphertext form. To enable data owners to further share the data encrypted in ciphertexts, many proxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes are proposed. However, most schemes only support single-recipient or coarse-grained re-encryption, which may limit the flexibility for data sharing. To address this issue, we propose a Policy-based Broadcast Access Authorization (PBAA) scheme by introducing the well-established identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) and key-policy attribute-based encryption into PRE. In our PBAA scheme, a data owner can apply IBBE to encrypt his data to a group of recipients. More importantly, the data owner can generate a delegation key with an access policy, and send this key to the cloud such that it can convert any initial ciphertext satisfying the access policy into a new ciphertext for a new group of recipients. With these features, cloud users can share their remote data in a secure and flexible way. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the PBAA scheme is secure and efficient, respectively.}

	abstract = {As a promising alternative solution to cloud storage, decentralized storage networks (DSN) are widely anticipated to develop continuously and reshape the storage market share in the foreseeable future. In particular, one of the most important research problems is how to enforce the quality of service (QoS) in the context of storage solutions. Despite plenty of auditing-related works in the context of cloud storage, none of them can be directly applied to the decentralized storage paradigm. The challenges of designing a feasible storage auditing framework emanate from two aspects: 1) security problems unique to the decentralized settings and 2) performance overhead due to on-chain operations. In this article, we first put forward a basic storage auditing framework that satisfies the security and efficiency requirements, and outperforms the existing approaches. We also identify a critical and overlooked security problem that would compromise the integrity of storage auditing solutions in the blockchain paradigm. With our refined storage auditing design based on customized zero knowledge protocols, we propose a convenient mitigation solution in our revised security model. The evaluation results confirm that our solution would only incur a 10–15 percent increase in the overall auditing costs for common usage scenarios, compared to the basic design.}

Existing security mechanisms, such as Same Origin Policy and Content Security Policy, do not apply to browser extensions that can read and write on web applications at any time. In spite of the state-of-the-art industrial efforts that rely on centralized management to inspect and detect malicious behaviors massively, the detection-based method cannot analyze fast-evolving behaviors of malicious browser extensions. To this end, we adopt a novel approach to protect users from malicious browser extensions, where we consider the problem of malicious extensions on the side of web applications. From a high level point of view, web developers are allowed to specify sensitive parts in a web application by using our provided software enclave. With our proposed WebEnclave extension installed, when users visit a web application, sensitive information required for the web application to work normally is sealed into an isolated world locally that malicious extensions cannot access. Extensive evaluation of our built prototype shows it can effectively protect user secrets from malicious extensions with negligible performance overhead and usability inconvenience.

Typically, it is coupled with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm, and consists in defining a pre-determined path traversed by a set of softwarized network nodes to provide specific services. A well known chain-like framework is the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a key infrastructure of 5G networks, that we characterize both by a performance and an availability perspective. Precisely, supported by a designed from scratch testbed realized through Clearwater platform, we perform a stochastic assessment of a softwarized IMS (softIMS) architecture where two main stages stand out: i) a performance analysis, where, exploiting the queueing network decomposition method, we formalize an optimization problem of resource allocation by modeling each softIMS node as an\nM/G/c\nsystem; ii) an availability assessment, where, adopting the Stochastic Reward Net methodology, we are able to characterize the behavior of softIMS in terms of failure/repair events, and to derive a set of optimal configurations satisfying a given availability requirement (e.g., five nines) while minimizing deployment costs. Two routines dubbed OptCNT and OptSearchChain have been devised to govern the performance and availability analyses, respectively.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, increasing business applications running in the cloud are embracing the microservice architecture. This article presents the challenges and implications of diagnosing root causes of anomalies in large-scale microservice architecture using real incidents in IBM Bluemix. We propose ServiceRank, a novel framework for anomaly detection and root cause identification in the microservice architecture to tackle these challenges. ServiceRank introduces an anomaly detector followed by a root cause analysis module, which detects the suspected abnormal service without pre-defined thresholds. To generalize our approach, we design a causal relationship extraction approach to construct impact graphs for root cause investigation according to specific anomalies. To eliminate cloud design-patterns' impact on anomaly diagnosis, we propose a correlation calibration mechanism in ServiceRank and present a calibration algorithm for the circuit breaker - A typical protection pattern in the microservice architecture. Finally, we design a heuristic investigation algorithm based on the second-order random walk to identify the anomaly's root cause. Experimental results in a simulated environment and the IBM Bluemix platform show that ServiceRank outperforms selected approaches in accuracy and offers fast identification of root cause service when an anomaly occurs. Moreover, we can deploy ServiceRank rapidly and easily in various systems without any pre-defined knowledge.}

	abstract = {Privacy concerns of using sensitive biometric data as credentials arise with the wide adoption of user-friendly face authentication. To protect the facial features of users, two important functions, i.e., revocability and reusability , are anticipated to be realized in a privacy-preserving face authentication design. Revocability requires an effective approach to deregister or replace user credentials when the authentication server is compromised; For reusability, the same credentials should appear independently to non-cooperating applications. Accomplishing these two properties is challenging as the uniqueness of facial features. In this article, we present PrivFace , a fast privacy-preserving face authentication, supporting revocable, and reusable biometric credentials. The core innovation is a novel secure inner product protocol that employs a lightweight random masking technique instead of time-consuming public-key cryptographic operations to efficiently measure facial data similarity. We rigorously analyze the security to show that the server cannot acquire the user's sensitive biological features during the authentication. Our experiment with real-world datasets shows that PrivFace is friendly to edge smart devices, which takes less than\n100ms\nper successful authentication on a common smartphone and outperforms the prior art J.

	abstract = {Security is increasingly critical in data communication of distributed environments. DDS is a middleware standard for data-centric publish/subscribe communication in a large scale real-time environment. DDS provides a security model for secure data communication. A major service of the security model is authorization. The authorization is based on the contents of messages rather than the information about the participant which should be the subject for access control. In this article, we present a novel approach for improved authorization of the DDS security model using ABAC. We first analyze the DDS security model and identify integration points for ABAC. Based on the analysis, we incorporate ABAC entities into the security model with ABAC behaviors defined across RTPS and DCPS. We implemented the model in XACML and evaluated by applying it to a patient monitoring system in the healthcare domain for its effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency in a controlled environment. The evaluation on effectiveness demonstrates that the model successfully enforces access control during the discovery process in a dynamic changing setting. The evaluation on scalability and efficiency demonstrates that the model is capable of handling 1,050 access requests simultaneously under the average of 40.60 milliseconds which satisfies the TT3 requirements in IEC 61850-5 with the average ABAC overheads of 10.62 milliseconds accounting for 26.67 percent of the communication time.}

	abstract = {Vision systems applied to drones, automatic vehicles, and robots have become an increasingly popular sensing method. However, vision sensors that make up these systems are vulnerable to malicious input attacks, which can lead to serious consequences. Privious work on attacking cameras of automatic vehicles shows that lasers can cause failure of camera-based functionalities, but it lacks analysis of the results and does not conduct experiments in the actual scenarios. In this article, a laser-based attack on cameras and binocular vision sensors of drones is presented. First, we propose a threat model that describes how an adversary attacks the drone then perform feasibility analysis of the attack from theory and practice. Next, we design multi-variable experiments in the lab to systematically study the effectiveness of the attack, and further analyze how each variable affects the results. To get intuitive and fine-grained results, multidimensional image similarity is used to measure the effects. In particular, experiments in the actual scenarios are carried out, and results show that the attack can make obstacle avoidance, target recognition and tracking completely failed. Finally, lightweight countermeasures based on hardware and software are proposed to improve sensor resilience against the attack.}

It also provides an application aware secure deduplication scheme to improve the data traffic and space efficiency of cloud storage for encrypted PHRs using variants of convergent encryption.

	abstract = {ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) becomes increasingly popular and revolutionizes the lives of people. A natural requirement for MLaaS is, however, to provide highly accurate prediction services. To achieve this, current MLaaS systems integrate and combine multiple well-trained models in their services. Yet, in reality, there is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect sufficiently well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of incentives. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by building up a model marketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which enforces the fair model-money swapping process between individual developers and MLaaS providers. Specifically, we deploy the swapping process on the blockchain, and further introduce a blockchain-empowered model benchmarking process for transparently determining the model prices according to their authentic performances, so as to motivate the faithful contributions of well-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for model benchmarking, our marketplace carefully offloads the heavy computation and designs a secure off-chain on-chain interaction protocol based on a trusted execution environment (TEE), for ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of benchmarking. We implement a prototype of our Golden Grain on the Ethereum blockchain, and conduct extensive experiments using standard benchmark datasets to demonstrate the practically affordable performance of our design.}

However, how to ensure user data privacy while remaining high recommendation accuracy is widely considered a challenge. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving method for the context-aware recommendation system in the two-cloud model. In particular, we first adjust the standard additive secret sharing scheme to support secure negative integers computation, based on which we manage to design secure comparison protocol and division protocols that enjoy desirable security and efficiency. By using these new protocols, we propose a secure and efficient context-aware recommendation system that also supports offline users. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our scheme achieves stronger data privacy preservation by further protecting the intermediate data calculated during the system training. Experimental results on real-world datasets indicate that our scheme is efficient. Notable, our system could achieve more significant performance improvement by running the underlying schemes in parallel.}

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) techniques allow ones to train models from a dataset to solve tasks. DL has attracted much interest given its fancy performance and potential market value, while security issues are amongst the most colossal concerns. However, the DL models may be prone to the membership inference attack, where an attacker determines whether a given sample is from the training dataset. Efforts have been made to hinder the attack but unfortunately, they may lead to a major overhead or impaired usability. In this article, we propose and implement DAMIA, leveraging Domain Adaptation (DA) as a defense aginist membership inference attacks. Our observation is that during the training process, DA obfuscates the dataset to be protected using another relate and similar dataset, and derives a model that underlyingly extracts the features from both datasets. Seeing that the model is obfuscated, membership inference fails, while the extracted features provide supports for usability. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validates our intuition. The model trained by DAMIA has a negligible footprint to the usability and introduces slight overhead compared with other defenses. Our experiment also excludes factors that may hinder the performance of DAMIA, and comparisons with other defenses, providing a potential guideline to vendors and researchers to benefit from our solution in a timely manner.}

	abstract = {Neural network based (NN-based) classifiers are known vulnerable against adversarial examples, namely, adding slight perturbations to a benign image cause a classifier to make a false prediction. To evaluate the robustness of NN-based classifiers against adversarial examples, numerous adversarial attacks with high success rates have been proposed recently. NN-based image classifiers usually normalize valid images (e.g., RGB image where the value at each coordinate is an integer between 0 and 255) into a real continuous domain (e.g., 3-dimensional matrix where the value at each coordinate is a real number between 0 and 1) and make classification decisions on the normalized images. However, adversarial examples crafted in a real continuous domain may become benign once they are denormalized back into the corresponding discrete integer domain, known as the discretization problem. This problem has been mentioned in some prior works but received relatively limited attention. In this work, we report the first comprehensive study of existing works to understand the impacts of the discretization problem. By analyzing 35 representative methods and empirically studying 20 representative open source tools, we found 29/35 (theoretically) and 14/20 (empirically) are affected by the discretization problem, e.g., the success rate could dramatically drop from 100 to 10 percent after the domain transformation. As the first step towards addressing this problem in a black-box scenario, we propose a novel derivative-free optimization method, which can directly craft adversarial examples in the discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that the method achieves nearly 100 percent attack success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks, comparable to the most popular white-box methods (FGSM, BIM and C&W), and significantly outperforms representative black-box methods (ZOO, AutoZOOM, NES-PGD, Bandits, FD, FD-PSO and GenAttack). Our results suggest that the discretization problem should be treated more seriously, and the discrete optimization algorithms show a promising future in crafting effective black-box attacks.}

Although such a technique may be effective in defending against naive attackers, an advanced attacker may monitor the operation of the CPS before launching a device physics aware mimicry attack. In this paper, we show how the spoofed response packets can be crafted by an attacker to deceive the CPS device authentication method based on the device operation times. Specifically, we use the timing and physical measurements embedded in the packets to reconstruct the devices in the physical system, which can be used to spoof response packets corresponding to the actual model and configuration of the devices in the CPS. We demonstrate the performance of our technique in realistic testbeds with real devices. Finally, we propose an upgraded defense mechanism that may be used against such mimicry attacks.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing is convenient to provide adequate resources for tenants. However, since multiple tenants share the underlying hardware resources, malicious tenants can use the shared processor to launch cache-based attacks. Such attacks can help malicious tenants steal private data of other tenants bypassing isolation mechanisms provided by the system, resulting in information leakage. Moreover, Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities can even extract memory contents arbitrarily with the help of cache attacks. Therefore, cache-based attacks pose a serious threat to the security of cloud platforms. To defeat such attacks, many detection methods have been proposed. However, most methods induce high false positives because they completely rely on the hardware performance counters (HPCs) and detect attacks with static criteria. To solve this problem, this article proposes a self-feedback detector named CBA-Detector to detect cache-based attacks in real time. Specifically, CBA-Detector first uses machine learning technologies to create models for identifying suspicious programs with abnormal hardware behaviors, then analyzes suspicious programs from the instruction level to identify real attacks and provide feedback. Based on the feedback, the models can be updated to further improve their detection accuracy. As our experiments show, CBA-Detector can accurately identify cache-based attacks in real time and introduces a little overhead. Besides, the misjudgment rate decreases with the running time.}

With the advent of the Internet of Vehicles(IoV), which is a system that allows communication between vehicles and other static components of the environment and is a convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicles are considered as an essential part of the network having secure data sensing and processing platforms. Many vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) research focused on the limited set of applications for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and typically implied safe driving, infotainment, and traffic management. However, it still exhibits an enormous scope of enhancement in various areas of ITS. In this article, we present a new architecture for IoV, keeping in view the different aspects of ITS and discussing how it can mitigate the challenges of secure communication in IoV along with the new visionary solution for authentication. An IoV is highly dynamic, having different topological structures, uneven distribution of nodes, and, therefore, vulnerable to various security and privacy attacks. This article also presents an efficient batch verification scheme having lightweight authentication that uses bilinear map and one-way hash functions to ensure a high level of security within the limited time constraint as compared to single message verification. The proposed scheme has better performance than the existing techniques in terms of computational delay, time complexity, transmission overhead, and energy consumption.}

We demonstrate the practicality and generality of such side-channel exploitation with a variety of assumed attack scenarios. Simulations on both Nvidia and Intel graphics adapters showed that our attack could achieve high accuracy, while in-depth studies were also presented to explore the low-level rationale behind such effectiveness. On top of that, we further propose a practical mitigation scheme which protects GPU workloads against the graphics-interrupt-based side-channel attack by piggybacking mask payloads on them to generate interfering graphics interrupt “noises”. Experiments show that our mitigation technique effectively prohibited spy processes from inferring user behaviors via analyzing runtime patterns of graphics interrupt with only trivial overhead.}

	abstract = {App repackaging has been raising serious concerns about the health of the Android ecosystem, and repackage-proofing is an important mitigation against threat of such attacks. However, existing app repackage-proofing schemes were only evaluated against trivial adversaries simulated using analyzers for other purposes (e.g., disclosing privacy leakage vulnerabilities), hence were shown “effective” mainly because their key programming features were not even supported by those toolkits. Furthermore, existing works have also neglected dynamic adversaries capable of manipulating victim apps at runtime, making them vulnerable against such stronger opponents. In this article, we propose a novel repackage-proofing framework, which deploys distributed detection and response sites into the subject app's native partition to cross-verify all its code files. The detection sites transmit obtained integrity metrics to response sites via secure communication channels built on the subject app's own control flows using a specialized obfuscation technique based on Collatz conjecture, turning the repackage-proofing process into complicated implicit flows that are intrinsically difficult to be resolved due to the conjecture's nonlinear dynamical behaviors. We evaluated our framework using sophisticated Android data-flow analyzers. Results showed that our prototype effectively impeded analyses aiming to trace the information flows of its cross-verification.}

	abstract = {Audit log contains the trace of different activities in computing systems, which makes it critical for security management, censorship, and forensics. However, experienced attackers may delete or modify the audit log after their attacks, which makes the audit log unavailable in attack investigation. In this article, we focus on the log integrity audit in the same domain, in which a number of servers update audit logs for a single or several organizations as an alliance. We propose a distributed efficient log integrity audit framework, called DELIA, which employs the distributed ledger technique to protect audit information, and utilizes the idea of state channel to improve the throughput of distributed ledger. To generate stable state from the rapidly-updated logs in the domain, we propose a log state generation scheme, which not only generates state suitable for audit logs, but also enables mutual supervision within the domain. To overcome the high latency in existing state channel schemes, we propose a hierarchal multi-party state channel scheme, which makes the latency in our framework independent of the number of servers in the domain. We implement DELIA on Ethereum and evaluate its performance. The results show that our framework is efficient and secure in practice.}

	abstract = {It is well known that each Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system forms a closed security domain and only recognizes certificates in its own domain (such as medical systems, financial systems, and 5G networks). When users need to access services in other domains, their identities often cannot be recognized or PKI systems require extremely complex operations to authenticate the users’ identities. This is the cross-domain authentication problem. The distributed consensus feature of blockchain provides a technical approach to solve this problem. However, there are some unresolved problems in existing blockchain-based schemes. On one hand, due to the low throughput of blockchain systems, the response speed may be insufferable when the number of cross-domain authentication requirements becomes enormous. On the other hand, these schemes insufficiently consider the privacy risk in the cross-domain scenario. In this article, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving cross-domain authentication scheme called XAuth that is integrated naturally with the existing PKI and Certificate Transparency (CT) systems. Specifically, we design a lightweight correctness verification protocol based on Multiple Merkle Hash Tree for rapid response. To protect users’ privacy, we present an anonymous authentication protocol for cross-domain authentication. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that XAuth is secure and efficient.}

	abstract = {Recent cyber-physical attacks, such as Stuxnet, Triton etc., have invoked an ominous realization about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, including water, power and gas distribution systems. Traditional IT security-biased protection methods that focus on improving cyber hygiene are largely impotent in the face of targeted attacks by advanced cyber-adversaries. Thus, there is an urgent need to analyze the safety and security of critical infrastructure in a holistic fashion, leveraging the physics of the cyber-physical system. System-Theoretic Accident Model & Processes (STAMP) offers a powerful framework to analyze complex systems; hitherto, STAMP has been used extensively to perform safety analyses but an integrated safety and cybersecurity analysis of industrial control systems (ICS) has not been published. This paper uses the electrical generation and distribution system of an archetypal industrial facility to demonstrate the application of a STAMP-based method – called Cybersafety – to identify and mitigate cyber-vulnerabilities in ICS. The key contribution of this work is to differentiate the additional steps required to perform a holistic cybersecurity analysis for an ICS of significant size and complexity and to present the analysis in a structured format that can be emulated for larger systems with many interdependent subsystems.}

	abstract = {Federated learning facilitates the collaborative training of a global model among distributed clients without sharing their training data. Secure aggregation, a new security primitive for federated learning, aims to preserve the confidentiality of both local models and training data. Unfortunately, existing secure aggregation solutions fail to defend against Byzantine failures that are common in distributed computing systems. In this work, we propose a new secure and efficient aggregation framework, SEAR, for Byzantine-robust federated learning. Relying on the trusted execution environment, i.e., Intel SGX, SEAR protects clients’ private models while enabling Byzantine resilience. Considering the limitation of the current Intel SGX's architecture (i.e., the limited trusted memory), we propose two data storage modes to efficiently implement aggregation algorithms efficiently in SGX. Moreover, to balance the efficiency and performance of aggregation, we propose a sampling-based method to efficiently detect Byzantine failures without degrading the global model's performance. We implement and evaluate SEAR in a LAN environment, and the experiment results show that SEAR is computationally efficient and robust to Byzantine adversaries. Compared to the previous practical secure aggregation framework, SEAR improves aggregation efficiency by 4-6 times while supporting Byzantine resilience at the same time.}

	abstract = {Steganography is the art and science of hiding secret messages in public communication so that the presence of secret messages cannot be detected. There are two distribution-preserving steganographic frameworks, one is sampler-based and the other is compression-based. The former requires a perfect sampler which yields data following the same distribution, and the latter needs the explicit distribution of generative objects. However, these two conditions are too strict even unrealistic in the traditional data environment, e.g., the distribution of natural images is hard to seize. Fortunately, generative models bring new vitality to distribution-preserving steganography, which can serve as the perfect sampler or provide the explicit distribution of generative media. Taking text-to-speech generation task as an example, we propose distribution-preserving steganography based on WaveGlow and WaveRNN, which corresponds to the former two categories. Steganalysis experiments and theoretical analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed methods can preserve the distribution.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been widely used for malware detection on different operating systems, including Android. To keep up with malware's evolution, the detection models usually need to be retrained periodically (e.g., every month) based on the data collected in the wild. However, this leads to poisoning attacks, specifically backdoor attacks, which subvert the learning process and create evasion ‘tunnels’ for manipulated malware samples. To date, we have not found any prior research that explored this critical problem in Android malware detectors. Although there are already some similar works in the image classification field, most of those similar ideas cannot be borrowed to solve this problem, because the assumption that the attacker has full control of the training data collection or labelling process is not realistic in real-world malware detection scenarios. In this article, we are motivated to study the backdoor attack against Android malware detectors. The backdoor is created and injected into the model stealthily without access to the training data and activated when an app with the trigger is presented. We demonstrate the proposed attack on four typical malware detectors that have been widely discussed in academia. Our evaluation shows that the proposed backdoor attack achieves up to 99 percent evasion rate over 750 malware samples. Moreover, the above successful attack is realised by a small size of triggers (only four features) and a very low data poisoning rate (0.3 percent).}

In practice, using a brute-force attack to discover vulnerabilities is infeasible due to the wide variety of attack patterns. Thus, various black-box testing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques suffer from low efficiency. This article presents Reinforcement-Learning-Driven and Adaptive Testing ( RAT ), an automated black-box testing strategy to discover injection vulnerabilities in WAFs. In particular, we focus on SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting, which have been among the top ten vulnerabilities over the past decade. More specifically, RAT clusters similar attack samples together. It then utilizes a reinforcement learning technique combined with a novel adaptive search algorithm to discover almost all bypassing attack patterns efficiently. We compare RAT with three state-of-the-art me&thods considering their objectives. The experiments show that RAT performs 33.53 and 63.16 percent on average better than its counterparts in discovering the most possible bypassing payloads and reducing the number of attempts before finding the first bypassing payload when testing well-configured WAFs, respectively.}

Most existing BFT protocols perform well in fault-free cases, but usually suffer from serious performance degradation when faults occur. In this paper, we present DBFT, a BFT protocol that realizes graceful performance degradation in faulty cases. The major novelty of DBFT lies in the double-response mechanism, which lets replica nodes deterministically respond to clients twice: one is after the speculative execution phase and the other is after the commitment phase. The double-response mechanism ensures good performance in spite of inconsistency in speculative execution. Also, to further alleviates undetectable performance attacks by a smartly malicious primary, we change primary upon every outstanding request. Moreover, DBFT does not involve clients in critical consensus operations so as to reduce the load of clients. We prove the correctness properties, i.e., safety and liveness, of DBFT. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that, DBFT outperforms similar BFT protocols obviously in normal cases.}

	abstract = {The explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is pushing forward the paradigm of fog computing services today. An important service for most fog-enhanced applications is geographic range-match, which means the fog-nodes can accurately collect sensed data from IoT devices based on their location distances. However, due to the increasing attacking surfaces, outsourcing range query operations to untrusted fog-nodes inevitably raises new privacy concerns about query content and device location exposure. In this article, we devise a new geographic range-match scheme for fog-enhanced services, which allows fog-nodes to securely collect range-based sensed data while protecting the location privacy of IoT devices. Our main idea is to formulate the problem of encrypted geographic queries as range-based pattern matching and carefully craft security schemes to enable efficient range queries in the ciphertext domain. The proposed range-match scheme is provably secure and can reduce accessible information during distance comparisons. We formally analyze the security strengths and complete the prototype implementation. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the practicality of our designs.}

In this article, two threat scenarios based on a novel false data injection attack (FDIA) model in a local P2P energy trading system are explored. In these scenarios, an attacker gains free energy by manipulating prosumers’ consumption and demand. Precise and fast attack detection is needed to guarantee suitable countermeasures to prevent potential risks. We propose a novel instance-based machine learning (ML) classifier for detecting FDIAs. In contrast to black-box ML models, our algorithm provides a transparent decision-making procedure with significant predictive performance. We apply our detection model to a real-world dataset from Austin, Texas. Our experimental results show superior performance as compared to several popular interpretable and non-interpretable ML methods. On average, we achieve a 96.10 percent detection rate, a 96.18 percent accuracy rate, and a false negative rate of 1.97 percent with our approach.}

	abstract = {The acceptance of the Internet of Things (IoT) for both household and industrial applications is accompanied by the rapid growth of IoT malware. With the increase of their attack surface, analyzing, understanding, and detecting IoT malicious behavior are crucial. Traditionally, machine and deep learning-based approaches are used for malware detection and behavioral understanding. However, recent research has shown the susceptibility of those approaches to adversarial attacks by introducing noise to the feature space. In this work, we introduce DL-FHMC, a fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for robust IoT malware detection. DL-FHMC utilizes Control Flow Graph (CFG)-based behavioral patterns for adversarial IoT malicious software detection. In particular, we extract a comprehensive list of behavioral patterns from a large dataset of malicious IoT binaries, represented by the shared execution flows, and use them as a modality for malicious behavior detection. Leveraging machine learning and subgraph isomorphism matching algorithms, DL-FHMC provides state-of-the-art performance in detecting malware samples and adversarial examples (AEs). We first highlight the caveats of CFG-based IoT malware detection systems, showing the adversarial capabilities in generating practical functionality-preserving AEs with reduced overhead using Graph Embedding and Augmentation (GEA) techniques. We then introduce Suspicious Behavior Detector, a component that extracts comprehensive behavioral patterns from three popular IoT malicious families, Gafgyt, Mirai, and Tsunami, for AEs detection with high accuracy. The proposed detector operates as a model-independent standalone module, with no prior assumptions of the adversarial attacks nor their configurations.}

	abstract = {With the increasing cloud storage service, users can enjoy non-interactive data sharing. Nonetheless, the data owner cannot timely update the shared data all the while. To ensure the timeliness and the authoritative source of the data, some users should be allowed to update the data on behalf of an authoritative data owner without changing data source. However, this allows harmful information to be injected into the data unnoticeably. How to efficiently realize editable cloud-based data sharing supporting malicious user tracing has not been fully explored. To address the problem, we propose a fine-grained and controllably editable cloud-based data sharing scheme with malicious user accountability. The data owner only needs to sign the shared data before uploading it and can specify a fine-grained access control policy about who can update the data and which portions of the data can be updated. The authorized users non-interactively convert signatures of original data into new ones for the updated data, which are indistinguishable from the original signatures. The proposed scheme also supports malicious user accountability in the sense that malicious users who post harmful information can be traced. We demonstrate the security and practicality of our scheme via formal security analysis and extensive experiments.}

	abstract = {Efficient online liveness fault detection is crucial to cloud systems. Most current online liveness fault detection techniques, such as system layer heartbeating, use a single unreliable detector to detect cloud system liveness. A single unreliable detector requires a certain amount of time to detect faults to avoid misjudgment, regardless of the type of fault detected. However, many faults can be detected by other detectors more quickly. Therefore, this article proposes an efficient online liveness fault detection mechanism for cloud systems that integrates existing detectors to quickly detect faults. We compared the fault detection efficiency of the proposed mechanism with those of counterpart mechanisms. According to the results, relative to system layer heartbeating without any auxiliary detection mechanism, our proposed mechanism had a 70.3 percent shorter fault detection time.}

	abstract = {It is undeniable that Internet of Things (IoT) in big data era can provide us with huge volumes of multi-dimensional data, transforming our society into a much more intelligent one. In order to fit for the multi-dimensional data processing in big data era, multi-dimensional range queries, especially over cloud platform, have received considerable attention in recent years. However, as the cloud server is not fully trustable, designing multi-dimensional range queries over encrypted data becomes a research trend, and many solutions have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, most existing solutions suffer from the leakage of the single-dimensional privacy, and such leakage would severely put the data at risk. Although a few existing works have addressed the problem of single-dimensional privacy, they are impractical in some real scenarios due to the issues of inefficiency, inaccuracy, and two-cloud-server requirement. Aiming at solving these issues, in this article, we propose a practical and privacy-preserving multi-dimensional range query (PRQ) scheme. Specifically, in our proposed PRQ scheme, we first index the multi-dimensional dataset with an R-tree and reduce R-tree based range queries to the problem of point intersection and range intersection. Then, by employing the lightweight matrix encryption technique, we design two novel algorithms for PRQ, i.e., multi-dimensional point intersection predicate encryption (PIPE) and multi-dimensional range intersection predicate encryption (RIPE), which can preserve the privacy of the proposed point intersection algorithm and range intersection algorithm, and further preserve the single-dimensional privacy of the proposed PRQ scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed PRQ scheme is indeed privacy-preserving. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted, and the results also demonstrate its efficiency.}

	abstract = {Conventional encryption solutions cannot defend against a coercive attacker who can capture the device owner, and force the owner to disclose keys used for decrypting sensitive data. To defend against such a coercive adversary, Plausibly Deniable Encryption (PDE) was introduced to allow the device owner to deny the very existence of sensitive data. The existing PDE systems built for computing devices equipped with flash storage media, are problematic, since they cannot defend against multi-snapshot adversaries, who may have access to the storage medium of a user's device at different points of time. In this article, we propose MDEFTL, a secure multi-snapshot PDE system for mobile devices which incorporates plausible deniability into Flash Translation Layer (FTL). MDEFTL is the first practical design which integrates multi-snapshot PDE into FTL, a pervasively deployed layer in literally all the current mobile devices. A salient advantage of MDEFTL lies in its capability of achieving multi-snapshot plausible deniability while being able to accommodate the special nature of NAND flash as well as eliminate deniability compromises from it. We implemented MDEFTL using an open-source NAND flash controller. The experimental results show that, compared to conventional encryption which does not provide deniability, our MDEFTL only incurs a small overhead.}

	abstract = {App repackaging has raised serious concerns to the Android ecosystem with the repackage-proofing technology attracting attention in the Android research community. In this article, we first show that existing repackage-proofing schemes rely on a flawed security assumption, and then propose a new class of active warden attack that intercepts and falsifies the metrics used by repackage-proofing for detecting the integrity violations during repackaging. We develop a proof-of-concept toolkit to demonstrate that all the existing repackage-proofing schemes can be bypassed by our attack toolkit. On the positive side, our analysis further identifies a new integrity metric in the Android ART runtime that can robustly and efficiently indicate bytecode tampering caused by either repackaging or active warden attacks. By associating this new metric with two supplemental verification mechanisms, we construct a multi-party verification framework that significantly raises the bar of repackage-proofing and identify conditions under which the proposed framework could detect app repackaging without getting compromised by active warden attacks.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification is important to intrusion detection and network management. Most of existing methods are based on machine learning techniques and rely on the features extracted manually from flows or packets. However, with the rapid growth of network applications, it is difficult for these approaches to handle new complex applications. In this article, we design a novel neural network, the Extended Byte Segment Neural Network (EBSNN), to classify netwrk traffic. EBSNN first divides a packet into header segments and payload segments, which are then fed into encoders composed of the recurrent neural networks with the attention mechanism. Based on the outputs, another encoder learns the high-level representation of the whole packet. In particular, side-channel features are learned from header segments to improve the performance. Finally, the label of the packet is obtained by the softmax function. Furthermore, EBSNN can classify network flows by examining the first few packets. Thorough experiments on the real-world datasets show that EBSNN achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both the application identification task and the website identification task.}

	abstract = {Data sketches are widely used to accelerate operations in big data analytics. For example, algorithms use sketches to compute the cardinality of a set, or the similarity between two sets. Sketches achieve significant reductions in computing time and storage requirements by providing probabilistic estimates rather than exact values. In many applications, an estimate is sufficient and thus, it is possible to trade accuracy for computational complexity; this enables the use of probabilistic sketches. However, the use of probabilistic data structures may create security issues because an attacker may manipulate the data in such a way that the sketches produce an incorrect estimate. For example, an attacker could potentially inflate the estimate of the number of distinct users to increase its revenues or popularity. Recent works have shown that an attacker can manipulate Hyperloglog, a sketch widely used for cardinality estimate, with no knowledge of its implementation details. This paper considers the security of K Minimum Values (KMV), a sketch that is also widely used to implement both cardinality and similarity estimates. Next sections characterize vulnerabilities at an implementation-independent level, with attacks formulated as part of a novel adversary model that manipulates the similarity estimate. Therefore, the paper pursues an analysis and simulation; the results suggest that as vulnerable to attacks, an increase or reduction of the estimate may occur. The execution of the attacks against the KMV implementation in the Apache DataSketches library validates these scenarios. Experiments show an excellent agreement between theory and experimental results.}

	abstract = {The volatile, covert and slow multistage attack patterns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) present a tricky challenge of APT detection, which are vital for organisations to protect their critical assets. In this article, we aim to develop system that aggregates and uses existing systems’ alerts to detect APTs. In order to achieve this, we propose a causal correlation aided semantic analysis system, called Poirot , for detecting the multi-stage threats over a long-time span from existing systems’ alerts. Poirot is capable of autonomously mining causality between anomalous events, which instructs us in reorganizing the original alerts and in constructing alert-chains. The system further exploits the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the semantic context of the alert-chains. This LDA model facilitates us to carry out the semantic analysis for capturing the latent attack intent as well as for reconstructing the APT scenario. We use an alert dataset provided by a cyber security company to verify the proposed Poirot in terms of the detection accuracy and the capability of attack scenario reconstruction. The experiment results are presented to show the achievable performance of the proposed semantic analysis based APT detection.}

	abstract = {Mobile payment system has been expected to provide more efficient and convenient payment methods. However, compared to traditional payments, mobile payment issues related to the security of electronic accounts and payment apps present serious challenges. In this paper, we find the potential security risks by analyzing the commonly used tokenized mobile payment method and put forward the corresponding off-site attack strategy. In this scenario, the attackers are not only limited to malicious third parties but also can be illegal merchants. To address the off-site attack, especially the potential attackers who may be malicious merchants, we also propose SALP, a secure and authenticated payment protocol, using time and position as necessary conditions for the payment confirmation. Furthermore, we leverage identity-based signature (IBS) to prevent altering the information and reduce the overhead of the third-party authentication. We conduct case studies to demonstrate that the SALP can effectively prevent the off-site payment attack without a trusted hardware environment. In particular, we finally argue that SALP does not bring additional system overhead without degrading the convenience of mobile payment.}

However, eliciting natural language scenarios from stakeholders can be an ad-hoc process and subject to ambiguity and incompleteness. In this article, we examine systematic scenario elicitation by introducing a method based on user stories that uses a simplified process model of iterative scenario refinement. The process consists of three steps: 1) eliciting an interaction statement that describes a critical action performed by a user or system process; 2) eliciting one or more descriptive statements about a technology that enables the interaction; and 3) refinement of the technology into technical variants that correspond to design alternatives. We empirically evaluated our method by implementing our prototype in a user study that collects 30 security scenarios from participants. Based on our analysis, our proposed method is shown effective. Participants had a 100 percent task completion rate with 57 percent of participants achieving complete task-success, and the remaining 43 percent of participants achieving partial task-success. We also show the effect of security domain knowledge, and the benefit of using structure when collecting security requirements in natural language text. Finally, we present lessons learned and future research directions.}

In SeUpdate , users do not need to share secret keys and a single query enables one to efficiently search all his authorized data. We formally define a security model, and prove our scheme have both forward and backward security. We note that the write permission of an SSE is realized for the first time.

	abstract = {Electronic voting (e-voting), compared with article voting, has advantages in several aspects. Among those benefits, the ability to audit the electoral process at every stage is one of the most desired features of an e-voting system. In Eurocrypt 2015, Kiayias, Zacharias, and Zhang proposed a new E2E verifiable e-voting system that for the first time provides E2E verifiability without relying on external sources of randomness or the random oracle model; the main advantage of such system is in the fact that election auditors need only the election transcript and the feedback from the voters to pronounce the election process unequivocally valid. Unfortunately, their system comes with a huge performance and storage penalty for the election authority (EA) compared to other e-voting systems such as Helios. The main reason is that due to the way the EA forms the proof of the tally result, it is required to precompute a number of ciphertexts for each voter and each possible choice of the voter. The performance penalty on the EA appears to be intrinsic to the approach: voters cannot compute an enciphered ballot themselves because there seems to be no way for them to prove that it is a valid ciphertext. In this work, we construct a new e-voting system that retains similar strong E2E characteristics (but against computational adversaries) while completely eliminating the performance and storage penalty of the EA. Our construction has similar performance to Helios and is practical. The privacy of our construction relies on the SXDH assumption over bilinear groups via complexity leveraging.}

	abstract = {Blockchain allows for secure management of a shared ledger by agreement protocols, where transactions are validated over network without central authorities. Although the agreement protocol has been thoroughly conducted of propagation and consensus researches, mobility of nodes in unstructured overlay networks has not received much attention. Besides, current dynamic propagation schemes waste travel hops and are low of delivery ratio. In this article, we propose a social characteristic-based propagation-efficient protocol NefSBFT to agree on system state plus consensus mechanisms in public blockchains. We devise a propagation technique (travel hops of at least\n1\n3\nsavings, delivery ratio above 0.93, etc.) for message multicasting when exploiting real nodes’ social characteristics of intermittent connectivity and frequent partitions. This propagation technique is executed in the improved FastBFT to achieve transaction ordering and block verification, thus, no controllable mobility is required during the whole system’s execution. NefSBFT achieves fast propagation, small message complexity and few resource consumption of travel hops and running nodes for complete protocol execution. We analyze NefSBFT’s security against DDOS attack of non-primary failure. The experiments show the performance tradeoff under different parameters, compare the propagation efficiency with Erlay and Flooding, and clarify NefSBFT’s impact on the whole system performance through comparison.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of storage overhead on public blockchains has urged the use of light clients that only store a small fraction of blockchain data and rely on other bootstrapped full nodes for data retrievals. Unfortunately, current blockchain light client designs are far from satisfactory. First, outsourcing retrieval requests could raise severe concerns about result correctness and privacy threats. Second, current light clients do not support rich query and enforce fee payments to full nodes. Given that blockchain storage increases day by day, enabling effective rich blockchain queries and fairly compensating full nodes’ ever growing costs has become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a general and secure paid query framework to simultaneously meet those demands above. Specifically, we leverage the integration of trusted hardware (e.g., Intel SGX) and smart contract as a starting point for building efficient yet secure query processing with fair payments. Then, we further craft several crucial performance and security refinement designs to boost query efficiency and enforce result correctness, and also explore an enclave-facilitated fair settlement mechanism for on-chain cost optimizations. We implement a prototype of our paid query framework and the experimental result has demonstrated its practically affordable cost.}

	abstract = {In Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a local passive eavesdropper utilizes network flow information to identify which web pages a user is browsing. Previous researchers have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of WF attacks under a strong Single Page Assumption: the network flow extracted by the adversary belongs to a single web page. In reality, the assumption may not hold because users tend to open multiple tabs simultaneously (or within a short period of time) so that their network traffic is mixed. In this article, we propose an automated multi-tab Website Fingerprinting attack that is able to accurately classify websites regardless of the number of simultaneously opened pages. Our design is powered by two innovative designs. First, we develop a split point classification method to dynamically identify the split point between the first page and its subsequent pages. As a result, the network traffic before the split point is solely generated for the first page. Then, we propose a new chunk-based WF classifier to infer the websites based on the initial chunk of clean traffic. For both classifiers, we apply automated feature selection to select a concise yet representative feature set. We implement a prototype of our design and perform extensive evaluations using SSH and Tor-based datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of both our system components individually and the integrated system as a whole.}

	abstract = {Random forest is one of the most heated machine learning tools in a wide range of industrial scenarios. Recently, federated learning enables efficient distributed machine learning without direct revealing of private participant data. In this article, we present a novel framework of federated random forest (RevFRF), and further emphatically discuss the participant revocation problem of federated learning based on RevFRF. Specifically, RevFRF first introduces a suite of homomorphic encryption based secure protocols to implement federated random forest (RF). The protocols cover the whole lifecycle of an RF model, including construction, prediction and participant revocation. Then, referring to the practical application scenarios of RevFRF, the existing federated learning frameworks ignore a fact that even every participant in federated learning cannot maintain the cooperation with others forever. In company-level cooperation, allowing the remaining companies to use a trained model that contains the memories from an off-lying company potentially leads to a significant conflict of interest. Therefore, we propose the revocable federated learning concept and illustrate how RevFRF implements participant revocation in applications. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that the protocols can efficiently implement federated RF and ensure the memories of a revoked participant in the trained RF to be securely removed.}

However, the hypervisor, as one of the foundations in virtualization, is challenging to survive under various malicious attacks due to its large attack surface. This article presents a novel group detection framework for the hypervisor code integrity, called Outlier . In an Outlier group, each host contains two parts. One is a distributed detection protocol, called Co-protocol , and the other is a detection interface, called Checker . The Co-protocol constructs trust for the integrity detection within an Outlier group. With the Co-protocol, each Checker conducts reliable integrity detection on the hypervisor code, and then the potential “outlier” host is perceived. We implement our Outlier prototype on the Xen hypervisor and evaluate its overhead. Experiments show that the introduction of the Outlier has few impacts on the performance of the virtualized systems.}

	abstract = {Resource availability of cloud computing systems is vital for today's information infrastructures. However, the constituent computing nodes are not fault free. The availability requirements on the delivered computing resources should be defined clearly by using a formal, contractual agreement, known as the Service Level Agreement (SLA), between providers and customers. To reduce the risk of various SLA violations, an efficient analysis of resource availability is important. This paper proposes a new analytical approach based on multi-valued decision diagrams (MDD) for the efficient resource availability analysis of cloud computing systems with heterogeneous, multi-state computing nodes. Particularly, a novel and efficient MDD construction method is presented to generate compact MDD models encoding different amounts of cumulative computing resources. Two detailed case studies are performed to illustrate basics and application of the proposed approach to reduce SLA violations and guarantee the availability requirements on the delivered computing resources. Benchmark studies are further conducted to show efficiency of the proposed MDD-based approach as compared with the continuous-time Markov chains-based method and the universal generation function-based method.}

	abstract = {The comparison operation for two numbers is one of the most frequently used operations in several applications, including deep learning. As such, lots of research has been conducted with the goal of efficiently evaluating the comparison operation in homomorphic encryption schemes. Recently, Cheon et al. (Asiacrypt 2020) proposed new comparison methods that approximated the sign function on homomorphically encrypted data using composite polynomials and proved that these methods had optimal asymptotic complexity. In this article, we propose a practically optimal method that approximates the sign function using compositions of minimax approximation polynomials. We prove that this approximation method is optimal with respect to depth consumption and the number of non-scalar multiplications. In addition, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm that determines the optimal composition of minimax approximation polynomials for the proposed homomorphic comparison operation using dynamic programming. The numerical analysis demonstrates that when minimizing runtime, the proposed comparison operation reduces the runtime by approximately 45 percent on average when compared to the previous algorithm. Likewise, when minimizing depth consumption, the proposed algorithm reduces the runtime by approximately 41 percent on average. In addition, when high precision in the comparison operation is required, the previous algorithm does not achieve 128-bit security, while the proposed algorithm does due to its small depth consumption.}

Particularly, data generators provide encrypted data to data brokers who use a functional secret key to learn nothing but the output of a specific, agreed upon, function over the raw data. Data consumers can purchase decrypted outputs from the brokers, accompanied by corresponding proofs of correctness . We implement a working prototype of Agora on Ethereum and experimentally evaluate its performance and deployment costs.

However, many SGX-based solutions are vulnerable to some side-channel attacks, including the access pattern leakage from both network and memory. Several data-oblivious algorithms with full obliviousness have been proposed in the literature, but they are impractical to be used in the cloud due to the expensive computational overhead. In this article, we propose a DPSpark system with the security defined in a notion of\n(ϵ,δ)\n-differentially private obliviousness (\n(ϵ,δ)\n-DPO), which relaxes full obliviousness to enable an efficiency improvement. Based on this definition, we present a perturbation-shuffle-analysis (PSA) computing architecture and design several typical differentially oblivious operators. In further, we optimize the system efficiency by reducing the number of oblivious shuffles and choosing an appropriate privacy budget. Finally, we benchmark the system in different parameters. The experimental results show that DPSpark significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art solutions, only with 10.1-85.4 percent additional overhead performing an SGX-based data analysis application.}

However, it faces many security threats as the outsourced data is no longer physically controlled by data owners, and the cloud that hosts the outsourced data is not fully trusted. Many privacy protection technologies have been adopted to solve this problem, among which cryptographic mechanisms have become one of the most promising tools. Unfortunately, current cryptographic mechanisms in healthcare IoT mainly suffer from the following challenges: 1) dynamic user groups for managing users’ accessibility; 2) efficient revocation mechanism to mitigate the burden during user revocation; 3) forward and backward secrecy to ensure session independence in the presence of session key leakage; 4) revocable storage to prevent data users from learning any unauthorized data even the data is authorized before; and 5) information manipulation during data transmission. In this article, we introduce a practical and secure system to address the above problems. Our system provides fine-grained access control with dynamic user groups for optimizing scalability and functionality. We prove that our system is secure against numerous real-world threats. Extensive comparison and experimental analysis demonstrate that our system enjoys superior performance than the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {The public cloud data integrity auditing technique is used to check the integrity of cloud data through the Third Party Auditor (TPA). In order to make it more practical, we propose a new paradigm called integrity auditing based on the keyword with sensitive information privacy for encrypted cloud data. This paradigm is designed for one of the most common scenario, that is, the user concerns the integrity of a portion of encrypted cloud files that contain his/her interested keywords. In our proposed scheme, the TPA who is only provided with the encrypted keyword, can audit the integrity of all encrypted cloud files that contain the user’s interested keyword. Meanwhile, the TPA cannot deduce the sensitive information about which files contain the keyword and how many files contain this keyword. These salient features are realized by leveraging a newly proposed Relation Authentication Label (RAL). The RAL can not only authenticate the relation that files contain the queried keyword, but also be used to generate the auditing proof without sensitive information exposure. We give concrete security analysis showing that the proposed scheme satisfies correctness, auditing soundness and sensitive information privacy. We also conduct the detailed experiments to show the efficiency of our scheme.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic protocols are often expected to be provably secure. However, this security guarantee often falls short in practice due to various implementation flaws. We propose a new paradigm called cryptographic program analysis (CPA) which prescribes the use of program analysis to detect these implementation flaws at compile time. The principal insight of the CPA is that many of these flaws in cryptographic implementations can be mapped to the violation of meta-level properties of implementations. A program property that is necessary to realize a cryptographic property is referred to as meta-level property. We show that violations of these meta-level properties can be identified at compile-time that can serve as sufficient evidence of the encompassing flaws. We investigated existing literature on cryptographic implementation flaws and derived 25 corresponding meta-level properties. To instantiate the abstract paradigm of CPA, we develop a specification language based on deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and show that most of the meta-level properties can be expressed in terms of our language. We then develop a tool called TaintCrypt which uses static taint analysis to identify meta-level property violations of C/C++ cryptographic implementations at compile-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of TaintCrypt by analyzing open-source C/C++ cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) and observe that TaintCrypt could have helped to avoid several high-profile flaws. We also evaluated TaintCrypt on 5 popular applications and libraries, which generated new security insights. The experimental evaluation on large-scale projects indicates the scalability of our approach.}

However, existing studies mainly focused on investigating the effectiveness of software diversity at the building-block level (e.g., whether two independent implementations indeed exhibit independent vulnerabilities); the effectiveness of enforcing network-wide software diversity is little understood, despite its importance in possibly helping justify investment in software diversification. As a first step towards ultimately tackling this problem, we propose a systematic framework for modeling and quantifying the cybersecurity effectiveness of network diversity, including a suite of cybersecurity metrics. We also present an agent-based simulation to empirically demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. We draw a number of insights, including the surprising result that proactive diversity is effective under very special circumstances, but reactive-adaptive diversity is much more effective in most cases.}

Therefore, it might not be realistic to rely on such an approach to automatically detect all logic bombs in large datasets. However, it could be used to speed up the location of malicious code, for instance, while reverse engineering applications. We also present TrigDB a database of 68 Android applications containing trigger-based behavior as a ground-truth to the research community.}

	abstract = {The Snowden revelations in 2013 showed that user machines running cryptographic protocols might be stealthily corrupted by attackers (e.g., manufacturers and supply-chain intermediaries) who could tamper cryptographic implementations to insert backdoors to undermine cryptographic tools. To formalize such attacks, in CRYPTO 2014, Bellare et al. proposed the notion of Algorithm-Substitution Attack (ASA) which has been extensively studied since then. In this work, we turn to investigate the security of anonymous communication (AC) protocol—a well-known tool to protect user privacy on the Internet—in the case when user machines are corrupted. Specifically, we give a formal treatment of ASAs on the universal mixnet-based AC (\nU-Mix-AC\n) protocols. We show that ASAs on\nU-Mix-AC\nprotocols could be more dangerous than previously thought by presenting attacks that are extremely powerful. As countermeasure, we adopt cryptographic reverse firewall (CRF), originally proposed by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz in EUROCRYPT 2015, to restore the security of\nU-Mix-AC\nprotocols in the presence of ASAs. We also implement proposed AC protocol, ASAs and CRFs for experimental evaluations, and the results show that the execution time of subverted algorithms is almost the same as that of faithful ones and our designed CRFs are effective to guard the security of\nU-Mix-AC\nprotocol.}

	abstract = {With the development of data plane programmable Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on the data plane increasingly become fatal. Currently, traditional attack detection methods are mainly used to detect whether a DDoS attack occurs and it is difficult to find the path that the attack flow traverses the network, which makes it difficult to accurately mitigate DDoS attacks. In this article, we propose a detection method based on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) over the data plane programmable SDN, which maps the network into a graph. It senses the state of switches through In-band Network Telemetry (INT) with sampling, inputs the network state into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network detection model, and finally finds out the switches through which DDoS attack flows pass. Based on this, we propose a defense method combined with an enhanced whitelist and a precise dropping strategy, which can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks and minimize the impact on legitimate network traffic. The evaluation results show that our detection method can accurately detect the path that the DDoS attack flows pass through, and can effectively mitigate the DDoS attack. Compared to classic methods, our method improves the detection accuracy by nearly 10%. At the same time, the southbound interface load and CPU overhead brought by our detection and defense process are much lower than the classic methods.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Content Centric Network (VCCN) has been proposed to address the issues of user mobility and sporadic connectivity in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). The in-network caching of VCCN can indeed improve the performance of content distribution in terms of cache hit and delivery latency by making each node store frequently accessed data. However, data caching unfortunately suffers from Cache Pollution Attack (CPA) that sends out fabricated requests to pollute the data cache. To prevent the degradation of network performance caused by such an attack, we propose a detection and defense scheme for CPA by adopting game theory. We model the attack scenario into a non-cooperative game model. First, we prove the non-existence of pure strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in the attacker and defender game, and propose a normal form game model with complete information and an extensive Bayesian form game model with incomplete information. Under the guidance of NE, we propose a punishment strategy to prevent the conspiracy attack and make the attackers behave normally. Moreover, we propose a cooperative detection scheme to give the Road Side Unit (RSU) the final decision on CPA based on the direct and indirect suspicious lists which are generated by each node according to the observed traffic pattern. Simulation evaluations demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in terms of cache hit, detecting ratio, and cache accuracy for detecting and defending CPA.}

	abstract = {The non-intrusive human activity recognition has been envisioned as a key enabler for many emerging applications requiring interactions between humans and computing systems. To accurately recognize different human behaviors, ubiquitous wireless signals are widely adopted, e.g., Wi-Fi signals, whose Channel State Information (CSI) can precisely reflect human movements. Unfortunately, nearly all Wi-Fi-based recognition systems assume a clean wireless environment, i.e., no interference will compromise the developed algorithms, which, apparently, is not feasible in practice. Even worse, for systems using Wi-Fi 2.4GHz signals, the widely existing interference from coexisting protocols, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE-Unlicensed, can easily compromise the recognition process, posing a hard limit on further enhancing the accuracy. Therefore, this work uncovers a new signal adversarial attack against Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition systems, by intentionally injecting interference using coexisting protocol signals. The contaminated Wi-Fi signal will distort CSI estimation and finally output a false recognition result. Different from traditional jamming attacks, this new adversarial attack is intelligent and stealthy in terms of avoiding being detected from traffic analysis. Along with both theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments, we have shown this newly-identified attack can easily compromise many existing Wi-Fi-based human recognition systems while still bypassing existing schemes for malicious signal detection.}

	abstract = {Super host refers to the host that has a high cardinality or exhibits a big change in a network. Facing big-volume network traffic, sketches have been widely applied to identify super hosts in an efficient and accurate way. However, most sketches cannot flexibly balance memory usage and accuracy in host cardinality estimation. Setting an inappropriate counter size for a sketch could either lead to inaccurate host cardinality estimation or cause memory waste. In order to solve this issue, we propose a novel extensible and reversible sketch, named ExtendedSketch, to achieve accurate super host identification with high memory efficiency. The core idea of ExtendedSketch is to monitor low-cardinality hosts with small-sized counters while dynamically extending the size of counters when monitoring high-cardinality hosts by applying an adaptive extension strategy. Such the strategy can adaptively increase counter size according to network traffic status at runtime, which not only ensures the accuracy of high-cardinality host estimation but also avoids unnecessary memory consumption. We perform theoretical analysis and conduct a series of experimental evaluations on ExtendedSketch based on real world network traffic. Experimental results show that under same memory usage, compared to the state-of-the-art, ExtendedSketch achieves\n1.4∼7.5\ntimes smaller error rate in estimating host cardinality with\n1.9∼26.7\ntimes better accuracy on super host identification and\n95∼\n2\n15\ntimes faster speed on abnormal address reconstruction. Its advance in accuracy and efficiency demonstrates the practical significance of ExtendedSketch for super host identification.}

	abstract = {With the rapid evolution of the blockchain technologies, the interoperability of different blockchain systems is emerging as one of the essential features of blockchains. Sidechains, a mechanism providing communications between different blockchains, have been heralded as the crucial factor of blockchain interoperability. However, there are still issues that need to be addressed in terms of security and feasibility. In this article, for proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, we propose efficient sidechain constructions with fast cross-chain transfers and small proof size by novel cross-chain certificate generation process and committee selection methods. Moreover, we also provide an extra functionality of supporting instant cross-chain transfers, such that emergent cross-chain transactions can be processed immediately. Compared to prior sidechains, our PoS sidechain construction can achieve faster cross-chain transfers, which improves the promptness of cross-chain transfers. While our PoW sidechain construction is more efficient with smaller proof size, reducing the storage and bandwidth overhead. Furthermore, we formally prove our sidechain constructions satisfying the properties of atomicity and timeliness. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of our sidechains, and the experimental results show our constructions is not only faster, but also efficient with low storage and bandwidth overhead.}

However, the existing data deduplication schemes supporting auditing not only cannot effectively alleviate the threats of the single point of failure and duplicate-faking attack, but also have to bear the massive waste of computation and storage resources caused by metadata redundancy and repetitive audit tasks. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure deduplication and shared auditing scheme in decentralized storage. Specifically, our scheme utilizes a novel deduplication protocol based on the double-server storage model to achieve efficient space-saving while protecting data users from losing data under a single point of failure and duplicate-faking attack. Besides, it sharply reduces the computation and storage costs of metadata by introducing a lightweight authenticator generation algorithm and update protocol. On this basis, our scheme further adopts a blockchain-based two-way shared auditing mechanism to achieve decentralized public auditing without the third-party auditor, in which the audit authenticators and results of outsourced data are shared among its users to avoid repetitive audit tasks. Security and performance analysis indicates the practicability of our scheme.}

In this article, instead of focusing on the detection of stealthy attacks, we aim to provide early warnings to operators, in order to avoid physical damage and preserve in advance data that may serve as an evidence during an investigation. We propose a framework to provide grounds for suspicion , i.e., preliminary indicators reflecting the likelihood of success of a stealthy attack. We propose two grounds for suspicion based on the behaviour of the physical process: (i) feasibility of a stealthy attack, and (ii) proximity to unsafe operating regions. We propose a metric to measure grounds for suspicion in real-time and provide soundness principles to ensure that such a metric is consistent with the grounds for suspicion. We apply our framework to Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems and formulate the suspicion metric computation as a real-time reachability problem. We validate our framework on a case study involving the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process. We show through numerical simulation that we can provide early warnings well before a potential stealthy attack can cause damage, while incurring minimal load on the network. Finally, we apply our framework on a use case to illustrate its usefulness in supporting early evidence collection.}

	abstract = {The performance of partially synchronous BFT-based consensus protocols is highly dependent on the primary node. All participant nodes in the network are blocked until they receive a proposal from the primary node to begin the consensus process. Therefore, an honest but slack node (with limited bandwidth) can adversely affect the performance when selected as primary. Hermes decreases protocol dependency on the primary node and minimizes transmission delay induced by the slack primary while keeping low message complexity and latency with high scalability. Hermes achieves these performance improvements by relaxing strong BFT agreement (safety) guarantees only for a specific type of Byzantine faults (also called equivocated faults). Interestingly, we show that in Hermes equivocating by a Byzantine primary is expensive and ineffective . Therefore, the safety of Hermes is comparable to the general BFT consensus. We deployed and tested Hermes on 190 Amazon\nEC2\ninstances. In these tests, Hermes’s performance was comparable to the state-of-the-art BFT protocol for blockchains (when the network size is large) in the absence of slack nodes. Whereas, in the presence of slack nodes Hermes outperforms the state-of-the-art BFT protocol significantly in terms of throughput and latency.}

	abstract = {One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their vulnerability to adversarial examples – those maliciously crafted inputs that deceive target DNNs. While a plethora of defenses have been proposed to mitigate the threats of adversarial examples, they are often penetrated or circumvented by even stronger attacks. To end the constant arms race between attackers and defenders, significant efforts have been devoted to providing certifiable robustness bounds for DNNs, which ensures that for a given input its vicinity does not admit any adversarial instances. Yet, most prior works focus on the case of symmetric vicinities (e.g., a hyperrectangle centered at a given input), while ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of perturbation direction (e.g., the input is more vulnerable along a particular perturbation direction). To bridge the gap, in this article, we propose the concept of asymmetric robustness to account for the inherent heterogeneity of perturbation directions, and present Amoeba 1 , an efficient certification framework for asymmetric robustness. Through extensive empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art DNNs and benchmark datasets, we show that compared with its symmetric counterpart, the asymmetric robustness bound of a given input describes its local geometric properties in a more precise manner, which enables use cases including (i) modeling stronger adversarial threats, (ii) interpreting DNN predictions, and makes it a more practical definition of certifiable robustness for security-sensitive domains.}

	abstract = {Fingerprint authentication has gained increasing popularity on mobile devices in recent years. However, it is vulnerable to presentation attacks, which include that an attacker spoofs with an artificial replica. Many liveness detection solutions have been proposed to defeat such presentation attacks; however, they all fail to defend against a particular type of presentation attack, namely puppet attack , in which an attacker places an unwilling victim's finger on the fingerprint sensor. In this article, we propose FinAuth , an effective and efficient software-only solution, to complement fingerprint authentication by defeating both synthetic spoofs and puppet attacks using fingertip-touch characteristics. FinAuth characterizes intrinsic fingertip-touch behaviors including the acceleration and the rotation angle of mobile devices when a legitimate user authenticates. FinAuth only utilizes common sensors equipped on mobile devices and does not introduce extra usability burdens on users. To evaluate the effectiveness of FinAuth , we carried out experiments on datasets collected from 90 subjects after the IRB approval. The results show that FinAuth can achieve the average balanced accuracy of 96.04% with 5 training data points and 99.28% with 100 training data points. Security experiments also demonstrate that FinAuth is resilient against possible attacks. In addition, we report the usability analysis results of FinAuth , including user authentication delay and overhead.}

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent threat to modern telecommunications networks: detecting and counteracting them is still a crucial unresolved challenge for network operators. DDoS attack detection is usually carried out in one or more central nodes that collect significant amounts of monitoring data from networking devices, potentially creating issues related to network overload or delay in detection. The dawn of programmable data planes in Software-Defined Networks can help mitigate this issue, opening the door to the detection of DDoS attacks directly in the data plane of the switches. However, the most widely-adopted data plane programming language, namely P4, lacks supporting many arithmetic operations, therefore, some of the advanced network monitoring functionalities needed for DDoS detection cannot be straightforwardly implemented in P4. This work overcomes such a limitation and presents two novel strategies for flow cardinality and for normalized network traffic entropy estimation that only use P4-supported operations and guarantee a low relative error. Additionally, based on these contributions, we propose a DDoS detection strategy relying on variations of the normalized network traffic entropy. Results show that it has comparable or higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions, yet being simpler and entirely executed in the data plane.}

Several studies showed that recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms made it possible to implement website fingerprinting attacks even though various defense techniques are present in the network. Nevertheless, trained models for website detection are not analyzed deeply to identify the leakage sources which are not always visible to both attackers and Cyber Threat Intelligence engineers. This study focuses on explaining ML and DL models in the context of microarchitecture-based website fingerprinting attacks. In the attack model, performance counters and cache occupancy side-channels are implemented on Google Chrome and Tor browsers. After ML and DL models are trained, LIME and saliency map XAI methods are applied to examine the leakage points in the side-channel data. In order to match the leakage samples in the measurements to the network traces, a novel dataset is collected by utilizing Google Chrome and Firefox browser developer tools. Next, the efficiency of explainable methods are analyzed with XAI metrics. Finally, an XAI-based obfuscation defense technique is proposed as a countermeasure against microarchitecture-based website fingerprinting attacks}

LFAs flows are seemingly legitimate at the origin. But their cumulative volume at critical links causes congestion. We propose RL-Shield, a reinforcement learning based defense system against LFAs. It mitigates LFAs and, at the same time, effectively forwards data traffic in the network. RL-Shield introduces a new detection algorithm for monitoring IP behaviors using the Dirichlet distribution and Bayesian statistics. It monitors the interplay of LFAs and traffic engineering and identifies source IPs that persistently react to re-routing events. The detection algorithm controls two reinforcement learning based routing algorithms that use a hop-by-hop technique to connect related node pairs.We evaluate RL-Shield on various network topologies by simulating several attack strategies. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and high-accuracy of RL-Shield.}

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in the use of data-driven techniques for classifying cyber-attacks and physical faults in cyber-physical systems. In real-world applications, the number of cyber-attack and faulty samples is usually far less than normal samples. This causes the skewed class distribution in data collected from cyber-physical systems. Training an accurate predictive model under skewed class conditions is not an easy task. In this work, we introduce a new generative adversarial framework for learning from skewed class distributions. This novel Adversarial Class-Imbalance Learning (ACIL) scheme has a novel loss function that is used during the adversarial training session. ACIL tries to iteratively adjust weights of an auxiliary multilayer perceptron to learn the minority class (i.e., cyber-attacks and physical faults) distributions along with the majority class (i.e., normal) distribution. Moreover, we devise an inclusive data-driven scheme for classifying cyber-attacks and faults, which includes four experiments of a baseline, nine state-of-the-art class-imbalance learning methods, two different generative-adversarial network-based approaches, and ACIL. These techniques are verified and compared through several experimental cyber-physical power scenarios. The obtained results show the effectiveness of ACIL for classifying samples of cyber-attacks and faults with skewed class distributions.}

In this article, we focus our attention on ARP cache poisoning, which is one of the most well-known and more adopted techniques for performing MITM attacks in Ethernet local area networks. More precisely, we will prove that, in network environments with at least one malicious host in the absence of cryptography, an ARP cache poisoning attack cannot be avoided. Subsequently, we advance ArpON, an efficient and effective solution to counteract ARP cache poisoning, and we use a model-checker for verifying its safety property. Our main finding, in accordance with the above impossibility result, is that the only event that compromises the safety of ArpON is a cache poisoning that nevertheless is removed by ArpON itself after a very short period, thus making it practically infeasible to perpetrate an ARP cache poisoning attack on network hosts where ArpON is installed.}

Security patches are usually associated with the device firmware, which relies on the device vendors and products. Due to compatibility and release-time issues, many embedded devices are still using outdated firmware with known vulnerabilities or flaws. In this article, we conduct a systematic study on device vulnerabilities by leveraging firmware fingerprints. Specifically, we use a web crawler to gather 9,716 firmware images from official websites of device vendors, and 347,685 security reports scattered across data archives, blogs, and forums. We propose to generate fine-grained fingerprints based on the subtle differences between the filesystems of various firmware images. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms and regex are used to identify device vulnerabilities and corresponding device firmware fingerprints. We perform real-world experiments to validate the performance of the firmware fingerprint, which yields high accuracy of 91% precision and 90% recall. We reveal that 6,898 reports have the firmware and related vulnerability information, and there are more than 10% of firmware vulnerabilities without any patches or solutions for mitigating underlying security risks.}

However, the collected user data, diagnosis results and the deployed machine learning model contain sensitive information of users and the healthcare provider, which may lead to serious privacy leakage. To achieve a secure outsourced diagnosis, both high security and low burden for users should be considered. However, the existing works can not solve these problems simultaneously. In this article, based on two non-colluding servers, a privacy-preserving cloud-aided diagnosis scheme for IoMT is proposed. Concretely, a hybrid data encryption method based on homomorphic encryption and AES is used to generate user requests in an efficient way. Besides, we propose a class of secure two-party protocols using homomorphic encryption, such as secure kernel function computation, secure multiplication, and secure comparison, and a privacy-preserving diagnosis scheme based on multi-class SVM with these building blocks is constructed, which can keep users offline in the diagnosis process. Finally, the security analysis and evaluation further illustrate that our scheme is superior to the prior works in terms of security and user-friendliness.}

Ensuring user safety in VRLE application domains such as education, flight simulations, military training is of utmost importance. Specifically, there is a need to study the impact of “immersion attacks” (e.g., chaperone attack, occlusion) and other types of attacks/faults (e.g., unauthorized access, network congestion) that may cause user safety issues (i.e., inducing of cybersickness ). In this article, we present a novel framework to quantify the security, privacy issues triggered via immersion attacks and other types of attacks/faults. By using a real-world social VRLE viz., vSocial and creating a novel attack-fault tree model, we show that such attacks can induce undesirable levels of cybersickness. Next, we convert these attack-fault trees into stochastic timed automata (STA) representations to perform statistical model checking for a given attacker profile. Using this model checking approach, we determine the most vulnerable threat scenarios that can trigger high occurrence cases of cybersickness for VRLE users. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our attack-fault tree modeling by incorporating suitable design principles such as hardening , diversity , redundancy and principle of least privilege to ensure user safety in a VRLE session.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are designed by adding small perturbations to clean examples in order to trick the classifier to misclassify. Various approaches based on optimization have been proposed for generating adversarial examples with minimal perturbation. Model training based methods such as Adversarial Transformation Network (ATN) provide a fundamentally new way to directly transform an input into an adversarial example, which promises fast generation of adversarial examples. However, the adversarial examples may have suboptimal quality with significantly large perturbations or low attack success rate at small perturbations. In this article, we propose a distance constrained A dversarial I mitation N etwork ( AIN ), which enhances ATN and is capable of generating both targeted and untargeted examples with an explicit distance constraint. AIN can not only generate large scale adversarial examples efficiently as achieved in ATN, but also imitate the behavior of state-of-the-art optimization-based methods, hence achieving improved quality. Extensive experiments show that AIN significantly outperforms ATN and other Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based methods in the quality of generated adversarial examples, and is much more efficient than optimization based methods while achieving comparable quality.}

These techniques are widely used in malicious fields such as vulnerability exploitation or theft of intellectual property. In this paper, we present an obfuscation strategy called “execution trace obfuscation,” wherein the program execution trace repeatedly switches between multiple threads. Our technique realizes equivalent code transformation by abstracting the obfuscation problems into pruning, cloning, and coloring problems in graph theory. Based on this, we further propose the cascade encryption of a function that depends on execution trace information with a key derived from the function address calculation process, followed by removing this key from the program. We have implemented a compiler-level system that inputs a source program and automatically generates an obfuscated file. Finally, random test proves the universality of obfuscation algorithm and verify the system’s performance. Results shows that our system can effectively interfere advanced reverse analysis tools.}

Therefore, multiple adaptive load-balancing mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to rebalance distributed streaming systems according to the changes in their workloads. This paper introduces a novel attack model that targets adaptive load-balancing mechanisms of distributed streaming systems. The attack reduces the throughput and the availability of the system by making it stay in a continuous state of rebalancing. This paper proposes Guard , a component that detects and blocks attacks that target the adaptive load balancing of distributed streaming systems. Guard uses an unsupervised machine-learning technique to detect malicious users that are involved in the attack. Guard does not block any user unless it detects that the user is malicious. Guard does not depend on a specific application. Experimental evaluation for a high-intensity attack illustrates that Guard improves the throughput and the availability of the system by 85% and 86%, respectively. Moreover, Guard improves the minimum availability that the attacker achieves by 325%.}

	abstract = {Big data workflow management systems (BDWMS)s have recently emerged as popular data analytics platforms to conduct large-scale data analytics in the cloud. However, the protection of data confidentiality and secure execution of workflow applications remains an important and challenging problem. Although a few data analytics systems, such as VC3 and Opaque, were developed to address security problems, they are limited to specific domains such as Map-Reduce-style and SQL query workflows. A generic secure framework for BDWMSs is still missing. In this article, we propose SecDATAVIEW, a distributed BDWMS that employs heterogeneous workers, such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV, to protect both workflow and workflow data execution, addressing three major security challenges: (1) Reducing the TCB size of the big data workflow management system in the untrusted cloud by leveraging the hardware-assisted TEE and software attestation; (2) Supporting Java-written workflow tasks to overcome the limitation of SGX’s lack of support for Java programs; and (3) Reducing the adverse impact of SGX enclave memory paging overhead through a “Hybrid” workflow task scheduling system that selectively deploys sensitive tasks to a mix of SGX and SEV worker nodes. Our experimental results show that SecDATAVIEW imposes moderate overhead on the workflow execution time.}

Moreover, some solutions even have a non-negligible negative impact on the classification accuracy of clean examples. Last but not least, they are impotent against the unconstrained attacks in which the attackers optimize the perturbation direction and size by additionally taking the defense methods into accounts. In this article, we propose GRIP-GAN to learn a general robust inverse perturbation (GRIP), which is not only able to offset any potential adversarial perturbations but also strengthen the target class-related features, purely from the clean images via a generative adversarial network (GAN). By feeding a random noise, GRIP-GAN is able to generate a dynamic GRIP for each input image to defend against unconstrained attacks. To further improve the defense performance, we also enable GRIP-GAN to generate a GRIP tailored to each input image via feeding input image specific noise to GRIP-GAN. Extensive experiments are carried out on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets against 17 adversarial attacks. The results show that GRIP-GAN outperforms all the baselines. We further share insights on the success of GRIP-GAN and provide visualized proofs.}

	abstract = {In this article, we analyze the inherent characteristic of smart grid systems, where we observe that a smart meter always generates different types of electricity consumption data for one user, and a control center (CC) always conducts an in-depth statistic analysis on these data for subsequent services. Among these data, some of them are very sensitive and should be prevented for any leakage and modification. Furthermore, due to the large number of users in a smart grid system, it is advantageous for CC to receive and process the data from different users simultaneously. To this end, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving multi-type data aggregation scheme (VPMDA) for smart grids. VPMDA enables an aggregator gateway (AG) to aggregate encrypted multi-type data and forward the aggregated data to CC, such that CC checks the integrity of aggregated data and obtains the statistic analysis results (e.g., average, variance) on the aggregated data without learning each individual data content. We further extend VPMDA to improve the performance of verifying data integrity on CC significantly. We formally prove the security of VPMDA against various attacks. We also implement a prototype of VPMDA and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the growing popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), a massive amount of purpose-specific, heterogeneous, inexpensive devices have been deployed. To allow these devices to perform their duties and collaborate efficiently, designing a secure and dependable communication channel is necessary. Pairing, as the fundamental procedure for establishing a trustworthy communication channel, has received extensive attention from security researchers. Previous secure pairing protocols depend on auxiliary peripherals (e.g., displays, speakers) to share the secret message, while for those products featuring with low-price, manufacturers would probably adopt insecure pairing methods to reduce the cost, so the devices may be subject to various attacks. To mitigate such a situation, we design a peripheral-free secure pairing protocol, termed SwitchPairing. Our protocol only requires users to connect the pre-pairing devices to the same power source, then randomly presses and releases the switch to generate a shared secret. It does not require additional peripherals and can defense eavesdropping and replay attacks innately. We implement a prototype via two CC2640R2F development boards and invite volunteers to participate in the experiments about bench-marking security and usability. The result of our experiments show that our protocol can fulfill the security and efficient requirement of various IoT applications.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability databases are vital sources of information on emergent software security concerns. Security professionals, from system administrators to developers to researchers, heavily depend on these databases to track vulnerabilities and analyze security trends. However, are these databases reliable and accurate? In this article, we explore this question with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the U.S. government's repository of vulnerability information that arguably serves as the industry standard. Through a systematic investigation, we uncover inconsistent or incomplete data in the NVD that can impact its practical uses, affecting information such as the vulnerability publication dates, applications affected by the vulnerability, their severity scores, and their high level type categorization. We explore the extent of these discrepancies and identify methods for their automated corrections. Finally, we demonstrate the impact that these data issues can pose by comparing analyses using the original and our rectified versions of the NVD. Ultimately, our investigation of the NVD not only produces an improved source of vulnerability information, but also provides important insights and guidance for the security community on the curation and use of such data sources.}

	abstract = {Major cloud service providers with well-equipped infrastructure, experienced machine learning (ML) expertise, and enriched training datasets are building ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems, in which clients can query ML-based prediction services with their data. Instead of moving private data to the cloud, in this work, we design, implement, and evaluate a novel secure ML system to enable MLaaS on edge devices. To protect the proprietary ML models on edge devices from revealing to the clients while maintaining a real-time inference is challenging. Existing privacy-preserving ML techniques can hardly satisfy real-time requirements. In our solution, we employ a secure enclave (e.g., SGX) to offer security and provide better efficiency than cryptographic techniques. However, the enclave alone cannot achieve real-time capability due to its limited capacity. We observe that the ML model imposes a severe accuracy degradation when adding noise to a few model weights. Based on this, we design a suite of novel solutions to optimize the performance of secure enclave-based inference service at the edge by enclosing only\n1%\ncomputation within secure enclaves. Our work can achieve up to a\n7.8×\nincrease in efficiency and a\n27×\nreduction in memory usage compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {User name and password are the most commonly used user authentication scheme in information systems. Strong passwords are secure but difficult to remember, so many users prefer easy-to-remember passwords. These weak passwords are also easily guessed by attackers, leading to online password guessing attacks, posing a serious security threat to information systems. Providing a reliable user authentication scheme to allow legitimate users to login while preventing online password guessing attacks is a challenge. We define a formal statistical model for the behavior of users and attackers, and differentiate users and attackers according to this model. The proposed solution computes the entropy of the passwords entered by the user and considers the user legitimate only if the entropy does not exceed a threshold. We show that entropy is an effective feature to distinguish legitimate users from attackers. We also show that the proposed user authentication scheme is effective in identifying password guessing attacks, even if the user chooses a common password. The new scheme adds an extra layer of protection to passwords, which is especially important for weak passwords. The scheme is a slight modification of the existing scheme, so it can be easily integrated into existing systems.}
