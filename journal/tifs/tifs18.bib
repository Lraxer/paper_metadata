	abstract = {Side-channel security has become a significant concern in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. The lattice-based CRYSTALS-Dilithium (abbr. Dilithium) becomes the primary signature standard algorithm recommended by NIST for most use cases in July 2022 due to its excellent performance in security and efficiency. Compared to Dilithium’s rich theoretical security analysis results, the side-channel security of its physical implementations needs to be further explored. In 2021, Liu et al. proposed a two-stage randomness leakage attack against Dilithium, in which only one randomness bit with a probability $> 0.5$ per signature is enough to recover the private key. However, they only carried out proof-of-concept experiments on “research-oriented” reference implementation of polynomial addition. Whether this method applies to complete real-world implementations of Dilithium is unknown. In this paper, we put this randomness leakage attack into real-world and recover the private key of unprotected and masked Dilithium on Arm Cortex-M4 processor using non-profiled power analysis attacks. Since randomness is introduced in the signing process, it is challenging to recover the randomness bit of Dilithium with high success rate in only one trace. Inspired by Liu et al., we propose a new non-profiled attack called Public Template Attack (PTA), a template-attack-like method that builds templates using public information. With PTA, we recover the randomness bit of unprotected and masked Dilithium with a success rate of 95% and 62% in one power trace, respectively. To demonstrate practicality, we perform practical power analysis attacks against different security levels of round 3 unprotected and masked Dilithium on STM32F405 microprocessor. Using 10,000 traces, the private key of unprotected Dilithium2 is recovered in 0.5 hours with an ordinary PC desktop. Our attack is 240 times faster than the state-of-the-art non-profiled attack. Moreover, the private key of masked Dilithium2 is recovered using 680,000 traces in 38 hours. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully attack masked Dilithium using non-profiled attacks.}

	abstract = {As one of the vital topics in intelligent surveillance, weakly supervised online video anomaly detection (WS-OVAD) aims to identify the ongoing anomalous events moment-to-moment in streaming videos, trained with only video-level annotations. Previous studies tended to utilize a unified single-stage framework, which struggled to simultaneously address the issues of online constraints and weakly supervised settings. To solve this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a two-stage-based framework, namely “decouple and resolve” (DAR), which consists of two modules, i.e., temporal proposal producer (TPP) and online anomaly localizer (OAL). With the supervision of video-level binary labels, the TPP module targets fully exploiting hierarchical temporal relations among snippets for generating precise snippet-level pseudo-labels. Then, given fine-grained supervisory signals produced by TPP, the Transformer-based OAL module is trained to aggregate both the useful cues retrieved from historical observations and anticipated future semantics, for making predictions at the current time step. Both the TPP and OAL modules are jointly trained to share the beneficial knowledge in a multi-task learning paradigm. Extensive experimental results on three public data sets validate the superior performance of the proposed DAR framework over the competing methods.}

	abstract = {Recently, moving target defence (MTD) has been proposed to thwart false data injection (FDI) attacks in power system state estimation by proactively triggering the distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. One of the key challenges for MTD in power grid is to design its real-time implementation with performance guarantees against unknown attacks. Converting from the noiseless assumptions in the literature, this paper investigates the MTD design problem in a noisy environment and proposes, for the first time, the concept of robust MTD to guarantee the worst-case detection rate against all unknown attacks. We theoretically prove that, for any given MTD strategy, the minimal principal angle between the Jacobian subspaces corresponds to the worst-case performance against all potential attacks. Based on this finding, robust MTD algorithms are formulated for the systems with both complete and incomplete configurations. Extensive simulations using standard IEEE benchmark systems demonstrate the improved average and worst-case performances of the proposed robust MTD against state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {In the modern interconnected world, intelligent networks and computing technologies are increasingly being incorporated in industrial systems. However, this adoption of advanced technology has resulted in increased cyber threats to cyber-physical systems. Existing intrusion detection systems are continually challenged by constantly evolving cyber threats. Machine learning algorithms have been applied for intrusion detection. In these techniques, a classification model is trained by learning cyber behavior patterns. However, these models typically require considerable high-quality datasets. Limited attack samples are available because of the unpredictability and constant evolution of cyber threats. To address these problems, we propose a novel federated Execution & Evaluation dual network framework (EEFED), which allows multiple federal participants to personalize their local detection models undermining the original purpose of Federated Learning. Thus, a general global detection model was developed for collaboratively improving the performance of a single local model against cyberattacks. The proposed personalized update algorithm and the optimizing backtracking parameters replacement policy effectively reduced the negative influence of federated learning in imbalanced and non-i.i.d distribution of data. The proposed method improved model stability. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on a network dataset in various cyber scenarios revealed that the proposed method outperformed single model and state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The iris patterns of the human contain a large amount of randomly distributed and irregularly shaped microstructures. These microstructures make the human iris informative biometric traits. To learn identity representation from them, this paper regards each iris region as a potential microstructure and proposes contextual measures (CM) to model the correlations between them. CM adopts two parallel branches to learn global and local contexts in iris image. The first one is the globally contextual measure branch. It measures the global context involving the relationships between all regions for feature aggregation and is robust to local occlusions. Besides, we improve its spatial perception considering the positional randomness of the microstructures. The other one is the locally contextual measure branch. This branch considers the role of local details in the phenotypic distinctiveness of iris patterns and learns a series of relationship atoms to capture contextual information from a local perspective. In addition, we develop the perturbation bottleneck to make sure that the two branches learn divergent contexts. It introduces perturbation to limit the information flow from input images to identity features, forcing CM to learn discriminative contextual information for iris recognition. Experimental results suggest that global and local contexts are two different clues critical for accurate iris recognition. The superior performance on four benchmark iris datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in within-database and cross-database scenarios.}

	abstract = {Towards the large amount of data generated everyday, data selective sharing and acquisition is one of the most significant data services in cloud-based systems, which enables data owners to selectively share their data to some particular users, and users to selectively acquire some interested data. However, it is challenging to protect data security and user privacy during data selective sharing and selective acquisition, because cloud servers are curious about the data or user’s interests, and even send data to some unauthorized users or some uninterested users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and provably secure Data selective Sharing and Acquisition ( {\\sf DSA}\n) scheme for cloud-based systems. Specifically, we first formulate a generic data selective sharing and acquisition problem in cloud-based systems by identifying several design goals in terms of correctness, soundness, security and efficiency. Then, we propose the {\\sf DSA}\nscheme to enable data owners to control the access of their data in a fine-grained manner, and enable users to refine the data acquisition without revealing their interests. Technically, a brand new cryptographic framework is developed to integrate attribute-based encryption with searchable encryption. Finally, we prove that the proposed {\\sf DSA}\nscheme is correct, sound, secure in the random oracle model, and efficient in practice.}

In the one-sided SDMM problem, where only one matrix of the matrix multiplication needs to be kept secure, we propose an achievable scheme that attains the optimal normalized download cost. The optimal scheme distributes a different number of encoded copies to each server, and the servers that collude more with others are given fewer encoded copies. The converse result is proved using Shearer’s lemma. In the two-sided SDMM problem under arbitrary collusion pattern, where the user would want to keep both matrices of the matrix multiplication secure, we provide an achievable scheme whose key parameters, including the method with which the random matrices are appended, the number of random matrices appended, the number of encoded copies generated, the number of encoded copies distributed to each server, are given by the proposed algorithm. We also demonstrate, via numerical results, the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of normalized upload-download cost trade-off, and show that it is much better than the current known scheme devised for the homogeneous collusion pattern.}

	abstract = {Most blockchains are designed to be immutable such that an object, e.g., a block or a transaction, is persisted once it has been registered. However, blockchain immutability hinders blockchain development due to the increasing abuse of blockchain storage and legal obligations. To break immutability in a controlled way, Derler et al. (NDSS’19) proposed a redactable blockchain with fine-grained controllable rewriting by introducing the notion of policy-based chameleon hash (PCH). Given a PCH-based object associated with an access policy, a trapdoor holder whose rewriting privileges satisfy the access policy can alter the object. Although this work offers an elegant approach to blockchain rewriting, it lacks accountability. In practice, the trapdoor holders may abuse their rewriting privileges, and even use their chameleon trapdoor to build a device in a blackbox manner to gain illegal profits while avoiding being caught. In this paper, we introduce a new design of PCH with blackbox accountability (PCHA). Blackbox accountability offers not only linkability between any modified object and its modifier, but also traceability that enables a central authority to identify responsible trapdoor holders whose secret keys have contributed to the blackbox device. Besides modeling PCHAs, we present a generic construction of PCHAs with rigorous security proofs. We instantiate a concrete construction of PCHA by introducing a practical attribute-based traitor tracing (ABTT) with adaptive security on prime-order pairing groups. The experimental analysis demonstrates that our PCHA and ABTT schemes have modest overheads and superior functionality to the state-of-the-art solutions. In particular, the price of accountability in key generation, hash, and adaption is almost negligible compared to the state-of-the-art solution.}

Our results are obtained for strong secrecy, do not require a pre-shared secret between the legitimate users, and do not require any symmetry properties on the channel. An extension of our results to compound main channels is also derived via new capacity-achieving polar coding schemes for compound settings.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) refers to matching face images captured in different domains, such as thermal to visible images (VIS), sketches to visible images, near-infrared to visible, and so on. This is particularly useful in matching visible spectrum images to images captured from other modalities. Though highly useful, HFR is challenging because of the domain gap between the source and target domain. Often, large-scale paired heterogeneous face image datasets are absent, preventing training models specifically for the heterogeneous task. In this work, we propose a surprisingly simple, yet, very effective method for matching face images across different sensing modalities. The core idea of the proposed approach is to add a novel neural network block called Prepended Domain Transformer (PDT) in front of a pre-trained face recognition (FR) model to address the domain gap. Retraining this new block with few paired samples in a contrastive learning setup was enough to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many HFR benchmarks. The PDT blocks can be retrained for several source-target combinations using the proposed general framework. The proposed approach is architecture agnostic, meaning they can be added to any pre-trained FR models. Further, the approach is modular and the new block can be trained with a minimal set of paired samples, making it much easier for practical deployment. The source code and protocols will be made available publicly.}

	abstract = {Due to incomplete appearance features, the identity matching of occluded pedestrians under multiple cross-camera views is a long-term challenge. Although existing re-identification (re-ID) solutions of occluded pedestrians have made significant progress, most of them achieve accurate identity matching by extracting pedestrian appearance features from unoccluded areas. However, when a pedestrian is partially blocked by the body of another pedestrian, existing methods cannot accurately determine whether the unoccluded body parts belong to the target pedestrian, which brings great difficulties to pedestrian identity matching. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces the idea of adversarial attack into occluded person re-ID and proposes an adversarial training framework that can defend against attacks from obstacles to resist the interference of obstacles on pedestrian identity matching. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed framework is not limited to extracting features of unoccluded human body areas to achieve occluded person re-ID, but explores how to make the re-ID model more resistant to obstacles. In the proposed framework, the occluded pedestrian images are regarded as adversarial examples and used to attack model training. If the trained model can defend against this kind of attack, its generalization is significantly improved, and the above-mentioned issues are also effectively solved. Specifically, a single-branch dual-stream collaborative network is designed. With the cooperation of the pre-trained verification guidance network, the model realizes the attack and defense of adversarial samples. This work broadens research horizons in robust model design of occluded person re-ID, and expands the scope of adversarial attacks. Compared with existing solutions, a lot of experimental results confirm that the proposed solution achieves better performance on two occluded re-ID datasets and two partial re-ID datasets.}

	abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT), as a non-destructive and high-resolution imaging technique, has been used to collect 3D fingertip data, which contains surface and internal fingerprints. Methods have been proposed for OCT fingerprint reconstruction. However, these methods have complex processing flow and are time consuming. In this paper, an end-to-end convolutional neural network based surface and internal fingerprint reconstruction method is proposed. A simple yet effective contour regression module is proposed and integrated in the network for direct estimation of contours of stratum corneum and viable epidermis junction from noisy OCT volume data, thus greatly simplify the processing flow. The proposed network further integrates multi-task learning with conventional segmentation task as auxiliary task and contour regression task as main task to facilitate the feature extraction and improve the robustness of the network. Depthwise separable convolution is adapted to a light-weight network for network computation complexity reduction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that an end-to-end method is proposed for surface and internal fingerprint extraction from noisy OCT volume data. Experiments and comparisons are carried out in terms of contour estimation accuracy, fingerprint quality, fingerprint matching performance and computation efficiency. Compared with conventional method, the proposed method utilizes only 6% of original network parameters and 0.7% of original computation time, but achieves comparably results. Fingerprint by depth proves the accuracy and robustness of contour regression than pixel-wise layer segmentation. The proposed method is noise-insensitive, process-simple and time-efficient for OCT fingerprint reconstruction, which is significant for real time application in Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems.}

	abstract = {Bias and fairness of biometric algorithms have been key topics of research in recent years, mainly due to the societal, legal and ethical implications of potentially unfair decisions made by automated decision-making models. A considerable amount of work has been done on this topic across different biometric modalities, aiming at better understanding the main sources of algorithmic bias or devising mitigation measures. In this work, we contribute to these efforts and present the first study investigating bias and fairness of sclera segmentation models. Although sclera segmentation techniques represent a key component of sclera-based biometric systems with a considerable impact on the overall recognition performance, the presence of different types of biases in sclera segmentation methods is still underexplored. To address this limitation, we describe the results of a group evaluation effort (involving seven research groups), organized to explore the performance of recent sclera segmentation models within a common experimental framework and study performance differences (and bias), originating from various demographic as well as environmental factors. Using five diverse datasets, we analyze seven independently developed sclera segmentation models in different experimental configurations. The results of our experiments suggest that there are significant differences in the overall segmentation performance across the seven models and that among the considered factors, ethnicity appears to be the biggest cause of bias. Additionally, we observe that training with representative and balanced data does not necessarily lead to less biased results. Finally, we find that in general there appears to be a negative correlation between the amount of bias observed (due to eye color, ethnicity and acquisition device) and the overall segmentation performance, suggesting that advances in the field of semantic segmentation may also help with mitigating bias.}

	abstract = {Social status, the social influence of a user, plays an important role in many real-world applications, e.g., trust relations and information propagation in a social network. In this paper, we reveal the possibility of falsifying social status through adversarial attacks in graph neural networks (GNNs). Different from neural networks in the visual or speech domain, GNNs take the attributes of nodes and edges in a graph as features. To cater to the characteristics of GNNs,\nwe design a new paradigm of adversarial example attack, named\nA\n2\nS\n2\n- GNN (\nGNN\n-based\nA\ndversarial\nA\nttacks on\nS\nocial\nS\ntatus), aiming at manipulating the social status of a target node in social networks. The key idea is to establish relationships or break relationships between a set of compromised nodes and the target node. More specifically, we consider a signed directed graph representing complicated positive/negative asymmetric relationships between nodes. We design an efficient adversarial attack algorithm to determine the minimum set of signed links that should be created or deleted to reach the attack objective. We conduct extensive experiments on baseline datasets. Compared with the benchmark algorithms,\nA\n2\nS\n2\n- GNN can effectively promote or vilify the social status of the target node up to 89.36% and 192.38%, respectively, while keeping the modification to the social network to the minimum. Furthermore, the experimental results on six status evaluating algorithms verify the transferability of our proposed attack algorithm.}

	abstract = {Facial age estimation has attracted considerable attention owing to its great potential in applications. However, it still falls short of reliable age estimation due to the lack of sufficient training data with accurate age labels. Using conventional semi-supervised methods to exploit unlabeled data appears to be a good solution, but it does not yield sufficient performance gains while significantly increasing training time. Therefore, to tackle these problems, we present a Divergence-driven Consistency Training (DCT) method for enhancing both efficiency and performance in this paper. Following the idea of pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, we assign pseudo labels predicted by the teacher model to unlabeled samples and then train the student model on labeled and unlabeled samples based on consistency regularization. Based on this, we propose two main promotions. The first is the Efficient Sample Selection (ESS) strategy, which is based on the Divergence Score to select effective samples from massive unlabeled images to reduce the training time and improve efficiency. The second is Identity Consistency (IC) regularization as the additional loss function, which introduces a high dependency of aging traits on a person. Moreover, we propose Local Prediction (LP), which is a plug-and-play component, to capture local semantics. Extensive experiments on multiple age benchmark datasets, including CACD, Morph II, MIVIA, and Chalearn LAP 2015, indicate DCT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly.}

	abstract = {Owing to the open Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, information interacting between devices and servers is transmitted over the public channel, which may lead to privacy breach of the device identity. Furthermore, communication entities are not fully trusted, and they may maliciously disclose the device identity information. Therefore, the anonymity of devices must be guaranteed. In addition, IIoT is resource-constrained, and complex algorithms are unsuitable for the IIoT system. Several researchers have attempted to design anonymous authentication schemes. The one-authentication-multiple-access approach allows devices to access server resources multiple times after a single authentication, and its authentication overhead is independent of the number of accesses. This can reduce the computational burden for devices that need to access the server frequently. However, existing anonymous authentication schemes do not support multiple accesses after one authentication, and still suffer from privacy issues and low efficiency for devices that need frequent access to the server. To address these issues, we propose a new anonymous authentication scheme that uses group signature technology to ensure device anonymity and uses Merkle hash tree technology to achieve multiple accesses after one authentication, thereby greatly reducing the authentication overhead of IIoT devices. Then, we validate the security of the scheme using the random oracle model and the BAN logic. Finally, compared with other related schemes, the experimental results show that our proposed scheme is more efficient and practical for resource-constrained IIoTs than other schemes.}

	abstract = {Due to a constant imbalance between demand and supply of power, ENF (Electric Network Frequency) fluctuates around a nominal value of 50 or 60 Hz. These variations in ENF cause the luminance intensity of a mains-powered light source, having no AC/DC converter inside, also to fluctuate. As a result, a video of a scene illuminated by a mains-powered light source can be used to estimate these fluctuations. As a consequence, the ENF signal within the time period when the video was captured can be estimated. This work explores the effects of frame rate harmonics that emerge when a rolling shutter based approach is used for ENF estimation from videos captured using CMOS cameras. These harmonics are a problem, especially for videos whose frame rate is a divisor of the nominal ENF because the frame rate harmonics and the ENF harmonics overlap. It is discovered that a key reason for the presence of the harmonics is the inverse square law of light that results in some repeating patterns of luminance variation across frames. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of the inverse square law of light on ENF estimation. A technique for refined ENF-related luminance signal estimation is proposed that attenuates these frame rate harmonics. This enables more accurate ENF estimates. The work also proposes an approach to estimate ENF-related luminance waveform cycles within each video frame, and a method to compute the confidence score for the estimated cycles. It provides insight into the reliability of the extracted ENF signal from a video, in the sense of its usefulness for ENF forensics, and consequently for ENF detection, which is an important precursor to ENF-based video forensics.}

In this paper, we study the PIR capacity of a graph-based replication system, in which each file is stored on two distinct servers according to an underlying graph. This paper aims to provide upper and lower bounds to the PIR capacity of graphs via various graph properties. In particular, we provide several upper bounds on the PIR capacity that apply to all graphs. We further improve the bounds for specific graph families (which turn out to be tight in certain cases) by utilizing the underlying graph structure. For the lower bounds, we establish optimal rate PIR schemes for star graphs via edge-coloring techniques. Lastly, we provide an improved PIR scheme for complete graphs, implying an improved general lower bound on all graphs’ PIR capacity.}

	abstract = {Physical-layer security is regaining traction in the research community, due to the performance boost introduced by deep learning classification algorithms. This is particularly true for sender authentication in wireless communications via radio fingerprinting. However, previous research mainly focused on terrestrial wireless devices while, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous work considered satellite transmitters. The satellite scenario is generally challenging because, among others, satellite radio transducers feature non-standard electronics (usually aged and specifically designed for harsh conditions). Moreover, the fingerprinting task is specifically difficult for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (like the ones we focus in this paper) since they feature a low bit-rate and orbit at about 800 Km from the Earth, at a speed of around 25,000 Km/h, thus making the receiver experiencing a down-link with unique attenuation and fading characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness and main limitations of AI-based solutions to the physical-layer authentication of LEO satellites. Our study is performed on massive real data—more than\n100M\nI-Q samples—collected from an extensive measurements campaign on the IRIDIUM LEO satellites constellation, lasting 589 hours. Our results show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and autoencoders (if properly calibrated) can be successfully adopted to authenticate the satellite transducers, with an accuracy spanning between 0.8 and 1, depending on prior assumptions. However, the relatively high number of I-Q samples required by the proposed methodology, coupled with the low bandwidth of satellite link, might prevent the detection of the spoofing attack under certain configuration parameters.}

	abstract = {Edge computing is an emerging distributed computing concept that allows edge servers to provide authorized consumers with various on-demand services. Due to highly dynamic and untrustworthy network environments, various potential security concerns (e.g., unauthorized access, data manipulation, and privacy leakage) have been the critical factors restricting the development of edge computing. A recent heterogeneous framework proposed by Dougherty et al. (CCS’21), named APECS, deploys token-based authorization and multiple attribute-based encryption (MABE) to guarantee access control and data confidentiality. While APECS achieves a secure asynchronous access control without the “always-on” cloud, it suffers from privacy leakage (caused by the public identity information) and fake data spreading issues (due to the data confidentiality). In this paper, we propose an Anonymous and Auditable Distributed Access Control Framework for Edge Computing (AADEC) to relieve these issues. AADEC is based on two building blocks that we designed, namely a conditional anonymous authentication and an auditable MABE with optimized performance. We also define the formal security models and present security proofs for our proposal. The final qualitative comparison and performance benchmark demonstrate that AADEC can achieve a trade-off among anonymity, confidentiality, auditability and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Hardware obfuscation is a prominent design-for-trust solution that thwarts intellectual property (IP) piracy and reverse-engineering of integrated circuits (ICs). Researchers have proposed several large-scale obfuscation techniques that achieve high output corruption—thus offering resilience against seminal attacks along with acceptable power, performance, and area overheads. However, the research community has primarily evaluated hardware obfuscation on relatively small scales of obfuscation (i.e., a fixed number of obfuscated components). Moreover, prior art caters toward specific schemes based either on gate obfuscation or interconnect obfuscation, i.e., two prominent types of hardware obfuscation. The former shortcoming suggests focusing on large-scale obfuscation schemes, and the latter suggests the need for a holistic assessment framework. In this work, we propose Titan, a holistic framework considering large-scale gate and interconnect obfuscation schemes. More specifically, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based attack framework that is trained to exploit structural and functional properties of any secured circuit to recover its obfuscated components. We evaluate Titan on various obfuscation schemes, considering selected ITC-99 benchmarks with up to 50% obfuscation scale, i.e., up to 21,326 obfuscated components. We observe a substantial information leakage through structural and functional properties of secured designs even for large-scale obfuscation. We quantify the information leakage in two ways: first, an average reduction of Hamming distance (HD, a well-established metric for attack evaluation) by 23.27 and 16.19 percentage points over the baseline of random guessing for gate and interconnect obfuscation, respectively; second, an average recovery of 63.40% and 77.94% of obfuscated components for gate and interconnect obfuscation, respectively. Importantly, these results are superior to six state-of-the-art attacks. We will open-source our framework and associated artifacts to enable reproducibility and foster future work.}

However, there are privacy and security issues with the fog computing-based healthcare systems, which can further increase the risk of leakage of sensitive healthcare data. Therefore, a security mechanism, such as access control for fog computing-based healthcare systems, is needed to protect its data against various potential attacks. Moreover, the blockchain technology can be used to solve the digital healthcare’s data integrity related problems. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) further makes the system more effective in case of prediction of health related diseases. In this paper, an AI-enabled secure communication mechanism in fog computing-based healthcare system (in short, AISCM-FH) has been proposed. The security analysis of the proposed AISCM-FH is provided using the standard random oracle model and also with the heuristic (non-mathematical) security analysis. A pragmatic study determines the impact of the proposed AISCM-FH on key performance indicators. Moreover, we include a detailed performance comparison of AISCM-FH with other relevant existing schemes to show that it has low communication and computation costs, and provides superior security and extra functionality attributes as compared to those for other competing existing approaches.}

	abstract = {There is a significant recent interest in collaboratively training a machine learning (ML) model without collecting data to a central server. Federated learning (FL) emerges as an efficient solution mitigating systemic privacy risks and communication costs. However, conventional FL inherited from parameter server designs relies too much on a central server, which may lead to privacy risks, communication bottlenecks, or a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous and hierarchical local gradient aggregation and global model update algorithm, FedDual, under three different security considerations for FL in large decentralized networks. Particularly, FedDual preserves privacy by introducing local differential privacy (LDP) and aggregates local gradients asynchronously and hierarchically via a pair-wise gossip algorithm, which is more competitive than previous gossip-based decentralized FL methods in terms of privacy preservation and communication efficiency, and offers more computational efficiency compared to existing blockchain-assisted decentralized FL methods. Further, we devise a noise cutting trick based on Private Set Intersection (PSI) to mitigate the prediction performance loss of the global model caused by the leveraged LDP. Rigorous analyses show that FedDual helps decentralized FL achieve the same convergence rate of\nO(\n1\nT\n)\nas centralized ML theoretically. Ingenious experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FEMNIST confirm that the model prediction performance gained from FedDual is close to centralized ML. More importantly, the proposed noise cutting trick helps FedDual to train better global models than LDP-based FL methods in terms of prediction performance and convergence rate.}

	abstract = {With the widespread use of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems in modern consumer devices, attack against ASR systems have become an attractive topic in recent years. Although related white-box attack methods have achieved remarkable success in fooling neural networks, they rely heavily on obtaining full access to the details of the target models. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the victim model and the inefficiency in utilizing query results, most of the existing black-box attack methods for ASR systems are query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack called the Monte Carlo gradient sign attack (MGSA) to generate adversarial audio samples with substantially fewer queries. It updates an original sample based on the elements obtained by a Monte Carlo tree search. We attribute its high query efficiency to the effective utilization of the dominant gradient phenomenon, which refers to the fact that only a few elements of each origin sample have significant effect on the output of ASR systems. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of MGSA and the stealthiness of the generated adversarial examples on the DeepSpeech system. The experimental results show that MGSA achieves 98% and 99% attack success rates on the LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the average number of queries is reduced by 27% and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 31%.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, many edge computing service providers expect to leverage the computational power and data of edge nodes to improve their models without transmitting data. Federated learning facilitates collaborative training of global models among distributed edge nodes without sharing their training data. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving federated learning applied to this scenario still faces three challenges: 1) It typically employs complex cryptographic algorithms, which results in excessive training overhead; 2) It cannot guarantee Byzantine robustness while preserving data privacy; and 3) Edge nodes have limited computing power and may drop out frequently. As a result, the privacy-preserving federated learning cannot be effectively applied to edge computing scenarios. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and secure federated learning scheme LSFL, which combines the features of privacy-preserving and Byzantine-Robustness. Specifically, we design the Lightweight Two-Server Secure Aggregation protocol, which utilizes two servers to enable secure Byzantine robustness and model aggregation. This scheme protects data privacy and prevents Byzantine nodes from influencing model aggregation. We implement and evaluate LSFL in a LAN environment, and the experiment results show that LSFL meets fidelity, security, and efficiency design goals, and maintains model accuracy compared to the popular FedAvg scheme.}

	abstract = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a technique of identifying individual emitters via unique characteristics of different emitters. In this paper, we consider a SEI problem with transmitter changing modulations scenario. There have been few previous studies on this type of scenario. To cope with the daunting challenge, a variable-modulation SEI framework with domain adaptation is proposed. The components characteristics of transmitter are analyzed and the distortion models are established for simulation dataset generation. The received in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) signals are demodulated and reconstructed to obtain baseband ideal modulation signals. The received signals and the ideal modulation signals corresponding to demodulation and reconstruction are merged and embedded into the feature extraction network. Domain adversarial neural network (DANN) is added into the SEI framework to generate domain-invariant fingerprint features, thus realizing variable-modulation SEI. To better align the distortion features of emitters with variable modulations, Gaussian Encoder is designed to project fingerprint features into Gaussian distribution space. Numerous experiments show that the proposed SEI framework can improve recognition accuracy of individual emitter for single modulation and variable transfer greatly, and outperform the existing transfer learning methods. The ablation study demonstrates the components of framework are complementary. The complexity of framework is acceptable and it can extend to large-scale use. The robustness of framework is verified through modulation transfer among PSK and QAM.}

	abstract = {To improve the quality of medical care and reduce unnecessary medical errors, electronic medical records (EMRs) are widely applied in hospital information systems. However, rapidly increasing EMRs bring heavy storage burden to hospitals. Professional data management service provided by cloud server can save the hospital local storage, and meanwhile, realize EMRs sharing among external researchers. However, the risk of leaking information of patients discourages hospitals to outsource patients’ EMRs to the remote cloud server. In this paper, a secure and efficient cloud storing and sharing method can be achieved by applying the proposed public key authenticated encryption with ciphertext update and keyword search (PAUKS). The proposed PAUKS scheme enables EMRs to be encrypted and queried without decryption, and is secure against inside keyword guessing attacks. Compared with the recently proposed PAEKS in literature, the PAUKS scheme enjoys smaller computation and communication overheads. The required number of trapdoors per query is constant in PAUKS scheme, instead of the linearly expanding as the number of senders increases in PAEKS. Furthermore, an inverted index can be built safely in PAUKS scheme to accelerate the query procedure. Experiment results show that our PAUKS scheme owns a comparable running overhead, but enjoys a higher query efficiency after ciphertexts update.}

	abstract = {Devices that ensure vehicle and driver safety or provide services to drivers generate a substantial amount of network traffic. The traffic is transmitted to the In-Vehicle Network (IVN) depending on the defined function. Consequently, to quickly process a lot of traffic transmitted to the IVN, an advanced network protocol such as Automotive Ethernet is necessary. However, owing to the connectivity reinforcement between devices inside a vehicle and external networks, attack vectors and vulnerabilities can be easily inherited from an established Ethernet to Automotive Ethernet. The present study proposes a method for detecting and identifying abnormalities in Automotive Ethernet based on wavelet transform and deep convolutional neural network. First, we define attack scenarios and extract normal and abnormal data corresponding to these scenarios. Second, we conduct several preprocesses, such as fixing the packet size and normalizing the network image data. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of the proposed method’s performance, considering the size of network image data and multi-resolution levels. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect an abnormality. Furthermore, the results suggest that the our method is more effective in terms of time-cost compared to default ResNet and EfficientNet methods.}

The adversary is assumed to employ a factorial hidden Markov model based inference for load disaggregation, and the corresponding joint log-likelihood of the model is utilized as the privacy measure. The studied dynamic pricing model is applicable to a commodity-limited market, where the price of unit amount of energy is determined by the users’ aggregated power request. The users’ energy management strategies are designed under a non-cooperative game framework, where each user aims to optimize a weighted sum objective of both privacy measure and energy cost saving. The users’ non-cooperative game is shown to admit a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. As an extension, a computational-efficient distributed Nash equilibrium energy management strategy seeking method is proposed, which also avoids the privacy leakage due to the sharing of payoff functions between users. The performance of practical designs of the energy management strategies in the equilibrium is finally illustrated by numerical experiments.}

In case of heterogeneous periocular images, alleviating this wide appearance gap and learning to extract illumination-invariant features from such local regions become cumbersome, giving rise to a challenging research problem. In this work, we design a novel holistic feature reconstruction-based attention module (H-FRAM) to refine and generate discriminative convolutional features. In contrast to existing spatial and channel attention mechanisms that compute 2-D or 1-D attention weights respectively, H-FRAM calculates the importance of each feature location by performing multi-linear principal component analysis on full 3-D tensor space. In H-FRAM, we claim that the feature reconstruction error, computed in a holistic manner, plays a crucial role in determining the relevance of feature locations. This reconstruction error is found by projecting the input feature map onto a multi-dimensional eigenspace that captures most of the important variations. To our knowledge, this is the first work which explores subspace learning approach in the context of 3-D attention mechanism to capture discriminative feature information. We have created an in-house cross-spectral periocular dataset containing visible and near-infrared images from 200 classes. The images are captured in unconstrained acquisition setup involving unsupervised eye and head movements as well as accessory variations (face masks and eyeglasses). Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art recognition performances on the existing and in-house datasets for heterogeneous and homogeneous periocular recognition as well as heterogeneous face recognition.}

	abstract = {Searchable encryption (SE) is a promising strategy for cloud-based file retrieval services, via structuring correspondences between files and keywords. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) has been generally employed in file-sharing services, as compared to searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). However, PEKS is inherently vulnerable to keyword guessing attacks (KGA) launched by a malicious server. To resist such attacks, classic solutions are dual-server PEKS (DS-PEKS) [TIFS’2015] and server-aided PEKS (SA-PEKS) [TIFS’2016]. However, the query model in these two solutions only support single keyword search pattern, which inevitably limits their wide deployments in practice due to efficiency concern. In this work, we present DSB-SE, a new cloud-based file sharing & retrieval system that supports boolean queries while retaining KGA-resistance. Compared to DS-PEKS and SA-PEKS, the cost of documents searching in DSB-SE is 25, 000 times (resp. 6, 600 times) faster when\n#keyword=10\nand\ns-term=1\n, where\ns\n-term is the least frequent keyword in the query pattern. Technically, the performance gain derives from revisiting traditional boolean SSE by: (i) introducing a pairing-free DDH-based transformation key modular that allows a data reader’s query pattern to be treated as a data writer’s; (ii) employing the dual-server methodology to support boolean query with efficient validity checks. In particular, the client-to-cloud communication cost for retrieving index of a single document is bounded to\n10\n−2\ns\n, and the cost of sending a token ranges from\n8×\n10\n−2\ns∼13×\n10\n−2\ns\n. Nevertheless, DSB-SE is\n1.5×\n10\n−2\ns\nslightly slower than DS-PEKS (but\n1.35×\n10\n−2\ns\nfaster than SA-PEKS) for key generation cost. Overall, the experiments show that the DSB-SE is practical and sufficient for real cloud applications, which is conducted over Enron dataset under a real-world cloud platform.}

While memristive devices have received substantial attention as sources of entropy for security applications, security vulnerabilities of memristive technologies for implementing cryptographic circuits have been largely neglected so far. In this article, we provide the first in-depth analysis of power side-channel analysis against memristive cryptographic implementations based on both: physical experiments and simulations. We show that power consumption models developed for CMOS are not fully adequate for memristive circuits. In particular, the memory effect makes even input-independent initialization cycles vulnerable to attacks that would be fundamentally impossible in CMOS technologies. We propose a memristive-oriented Power Estimation Model (mPEM) integrated into the Stochastic Approach (StA) framework and demonstrate its effectiveness against larger-scale circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that attack countermeasures that were effective for CMOS fail for fundamental reasons in the memristive case.}

One of the most important aspects of threat hunting is automation, especially when it concerns targeted data collection. Multi-armed bandits (MAB) is a family of problems that can be used to optimize the targeted data collection and balance between exploration and exploitation of the collected data. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art policies for solving MAB with dependent arms do not utilize the detailed interrelationships between attacks such as telemetry or artifacts shared by multiple attacks. We propose new policies, one of which is theoretically proven, to prioritize the investigated attacks during targeted data collection.

In this paper we propose a framework of coding scheme extended from Dual-Syndrome Trellis Codes (Dual-STCs) for robust adaptive steganography. We use the conditional probability distribution of correct stego bits conditioned on disturbed stego data as channel knowledge, and formulate error-correcting as maximizing this probability. By extending Dual-STCs to double-layered embedding, we design an iteratively decoding scheme for error-correcting two layer stego bits from their joint conditional probabilities, and strictly prove its convergence. Besides, we design a method to estimate these probability distributions from stego data pairs uploaded/downloaded from the lossy transmission channel. The channel knowledge can also be used by steganographer, and we propose a universal method to revise steganographic distortion values for higher robustness under the guidance of the channel knowledge. Compared with existing coding methods for robust steganography, our method can make use of channel knowledge to improve error correcting ability and meanwhile maintain high security, which is demonstrated by experimental results.}

	abstract = {As password distribution lays the foundation for various password research, accurately characterizing it receives considerable attention. At IEEE TIFS’17, Wang et al. proposed the CDF-Zipf distribution model with the golden-section-search (GSS) fitting method to find the optimal parameters. Their model has been adopted by over 120 password-related studies. In this paper, we address their remaining, fundamental goodness-of-fit issue of password distribution in a principled approach. First, we prove that the confidence level of the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo approach (MCA, for the goodness-of-fit test) converges asymptotically to 0. By experimenting on 228.92 million real-world passwords, we confirm Wang et al.’s conjecture on the effect of sample size that minor deviations would lead to statistical significance for large-scale datasets. We propose both absolute and relative deviation metrics, and find that 1% random deviations in both metrics suffice to reject CDF-Zipf. Second, we attempt to reduce the non-negligible gap between the empirical and fitted distributions (with the maximum deviation of cumulative distribution function (CDF) being 1.91% on average). We explore eight alternative distribution models in two coordinate systems, and find that three models are more accurate than CDF-Zipf, but none can pass MCA. Particularly, we reveal that stretched-exponential, a variant of CDF-Zipf, can on average reduce the maximum CDF deviation from 1.91% to 1.25%. Third, to replace MCA, we introduce a new goodness-of-fit measure based on log-likelihoods. We find that stretched-exponential constantly has a larger log-likelihood than its counterparts. In all, stretched-exponential fits passwords better and further supports Zipf’s law in passwords.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability fixing is time-consuming, hence, not all of the discovered vulnerabilities can be fixed timely. In reality, developers prioritize vulnerability fixing based on exploitability. Large numbers of vulnerabilities are delayed to patch or even ignored as they are regarded as “unexploitable” or underestimated owing to the difficulty in exploiting the weak primitives. However, exploits may have been in the wild. In this paper, to exploit the weak primitives that traditional approaches fail to exploit, we propose a versatile exploitation strategy that can transform weak exploit primitives into strong exploit primitives. Based on a special object in the kernel named Thanos object, our approach can exploit a UAF vulnerability that does not have function pointer dereference and an OOB write vulnerability that has limited write length and value. Our approach overcomes the shortage that traditional exploitation strategies heavily rely on the capability of the vulnerability. To facilitate using Thanos objects, we devise a tool named TAODE to automatically search for eligible Thanos objects from the kernel. Then, it evaluates the usability of the identified Thanos objects by the complexity of the constraints. Finally, it pairs vulnerabilities with eligible Thanos objects. We have evaluated our approach with real-world kernels. TAODE successfully identified numerous Thanos objects from Linux. Using the identified Thanos objects, we proved the feasibility of our approach with 20 real-world vulnerabilities, most of which traditional techniques failed to exploit. Through the experiments, we find that in addition to exploiting weak primitives, our approach can sometimes bypass the kernel SMAP mechanism (CVE-2016-10150, CVE-2016-0728), better utilize the leaked heap pointer address (CVE-2022-25636), and even theoretically break certain vulnerability patches (e.g., double-free).}

	abstract = {Several cryptosystems based on the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem have been proposed within the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, e.g., NewHope. Furthermore, there are systems like Kyber which are based on the closely related MLWE assumption. Both previously mentioned schemes result in a non-zero decryption failure rate (DFR). The combination of encryption and decryption for these kinds of algorithms can be interpreted as data transmission over a noisy channel. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first work that analyzes the capacity of this channel. We show how to modify the encryption schemes such that the input alphabets of the corresponding channels are increased. In particular, we present lower bounds on their capacities which show that the transmission rate can be significantly increased compared to standard proposals in the literature. Furthermore, under the common assumption of stochastically independent coefficient failures, we give lower bounds on achievable rates based on both the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and concrete code constructions using BCH codes. By means of our constructions, we can either increase the total bitrate (by a factor of 1.84 for Kyber and by factor of 7 for NewHope) while guaranteeing the same DFR or for the same bitrate, we can significantly reduce the DFR for all schemes considered in this work (e.g., for NewHope from 2−216 to 2−12769).}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), each client collaboratively trains the global model through the cloud server (CS) without sharing its original dataset in edge computing. However, CS can analyze and forge the uploaded parameters and infer the privacy of clients, which calls for the necessity of verifying the integrity and protecting the privacy for aggregation. Although there are some works to ensure the verifiability of aggregation results, there is still a lack of work on analyzing the relationship between verification and dropout rate for edge computing. In this work, we propose privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning (PVFL) with low communication and computation overhead for verification. We theoretically demonstrate that PVFL has three properties: 1) the communication overhead for verification is independent of the dropouts and the dimension of the parameter vector; 2) the computation overhead for verification is independent of the dropouts; 3) the value of the loss function is negatively correlated with the number of dropouts. Experimental results demonstrate the correctness of our theoretical results and practical performance with a high dropout rate, thereby facilitating the design of privacy-preserving and verifiable FL algorithms for edge computing with a high dimension of parameter vectors and a high dropout rate.}

	abstract = {As a critical infrastructure, the traditional power system has transformed into a cyber-physical integrated smart grid. However, the vulnerabilities exposed in either the cyber or physical layer might be exploited by adversaries to construct complicated and coordinated attacks consequent in destructive impacts. In this paper, we propose a stealthy physics-manipulated attack (SPMA) by masking the physical attacks on the flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) with strategic cyberattacks. To construct the SPMA, we first manipulate the control command sent to the FACTS device to change the reactance and then tamper with the sensor measurements to conceal it. The SPMA is constructed with complete-informed and incomplete-informed attackers, noisy sensor measurements, and a nonlinear AC model, respectively. The impact of the physics manipulation on the real-time economic dispatch and the system’s operation security are formulated and numerically analyzed. Furthermore, we also provide potential countermeasures from three aspects to defend against SPMAs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with the IEEE test power systems to evaluate the stealthiness of SPMAs and the economic losses and potential cascading failures caused by SPMAs using real-world load profiles.}

	abstract = {Multi-factor authentication is a promising way to enhance the security of password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) schemes. It is widely deployed in various daily applications for mobile devices (e.g., e-Bank, smart home, and cloud services) to provide the first line of defense for system security. However, despite intensive research, how to design a secure and efficient multi-factor authentication scheme is still a challenging problem. Hundreds of new schemes have been successfully proposed, and many are even equipped with a formal security proof. However, most of them have been shortly found to be insecure and cannot achieve the claimed security goals. Now a paradox arises: How can a multi-factor scheme that was “formally proven secure” later be found insecure? To answer this seemingly contradicting question, this paper takes a substantial first step towards systematically exploring the security proof failures in multi-factor authentication schemes for mobile devices. We first investigate the root causes of the “provable security” failure in vulnerable multi-factor authentication schemes under the random oracle model, and classify them into eight different types in terms of the five steps of conducting a formal security proof. Then, we elaborate on each type of these eight proof failures by examining three typical vulnerable protocols, and suggest corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we conduct a large-scale comparative measurement of 70 representative multi-factor authentication schemes under our extended evaluation criteria. The schemes we select range from 2009 to 2022, and the comparison results suggest that understanding failures in formal security proofs is helpful to design more secure multi-factor authentication protocols for mobile devices.}

We introduce a GAN-based adversarial attack to effectively fool encoder-decoder based image captioning frameworks. Unique to our attack is the systematic disruption of the internal representation of an image at the encoder stage which allows control over the captions generated at the decoder stage. We cause the desired disruption with an input perturbation that promotes similarity between the features of the input image with a target image of our choice. The target image provides a convenient handle to control the incorrect captions in our method. We do not assume any knowledge of the decoder module, which makes our attack ‘gray-box’. Moreover, our attack remains agnostic to the type of decoder module, thereby proving effective for RNNs as well as Transformers as the language models. This makes our attack highly pragmatic.}

	abstract = {As automated face recognition applications tend towards ubiquity, there is a growing need to secure the sensitive face data used within these systems. This paper presents a survey of biometric template protection (BTP) methods proposed for securing face “templates” (images/features) in neural-network-based face recognition systems. The BTP methods are categorised into two types: Non-NN and NN-learned. Non-NN methods use a neural network (NN) as a feature extractor, but the BTP part is based on a non-NN algorithm applied at either image-level or feature-level. In contrast, NN-learned methods specifically employ a NN to learn a protected template from the unprotected face image/features. We present examples of Non-NN and NN-learned face BTP methods from the literature, along with a discussion of the two categories’ comparative strengths and weaknesses. We also investigate the techniques used to evaluate these BTP methods, in terms of the three most common BTP criteria: “recognition accuracy”, “irreversibility”, and “renewability/unlinkability”. As expected, the recognition accuracy of protected face recognition systems is generally evaluated using the same (empirical) techniques employed for evaluating standard (unprotected) biometric systems. On the contrary, most irreversibility and renewability/unlinkability evaluations are found to be based on theoretical assumptions/estimates or verbal implications, with a lack of empirical validation in a practical face recognition context. We recommend, therefore, a greater focus on empirical evaluation strategies, to provide more concrete insights into the irreversibility and renewability/unlinkability of face BTP methods in practice. Additionally, an exploration of the reproducibility of the studied BTP works, in terms of the public availability of their implementation code and evaluation datasets/procedures, suggests that it would currently be difficult for the BTP community to faithfully replicate (and thus validate) most of the reported findings. So, we advocate for a push towards reproducibility, in the hope of furthering our understanding of the face BTP research field.}

	abstract = {Protecting large-scale networks, especially Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), against distributed attacks in a cost-effective manner plays a prominent role in cybersecurity. One of the pervasive approaches to plug security holes and prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited is Moving Target Defense (MTD), which can be efficiently implemented in SDN as it needs comprehensive and proactive network monitoring. The critical key in MTD is to shuffle the least number of hosts with an acceptable security impact and keep the shuffling frequency low. In this paper, we have proposed an SDN-oriented Cost-effective Edge-based MTD Approach (SCEMA) to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks at a lower cost by shuffling an optimized set of hosts that have the highest number of connections to the critical servers. These connections are named edges from a graph-theoretical point of view. We have proposed a three-layer mathematical model for the network that can easily calculate the attack cost. We have also designed a system based on SCEMA and simulated it in Mininet. The results show that SCEMA has lower complexity than the previous related MTD field with acceptable performance.}

	abstract = {The cloud-based data sharing technology with cryptographic primitives enables data owners to outsource data into paradigms and privately share information with arbitrary recipients without geographic barriers. However, we argue that most of existing efforts for outsourced data sharing are either inefficient, inflexible, or incompletely secure due to the following problems: (1) lack of efficient strategies for dynamically designating target ciphertexts to multiple recipients; (2) how to hide the identity of the recipient and (3) how to verify the correctness of outsourced ciphertext transformation without any denial. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has thoroughly explored the above three issues, motivating us to design such an efficient and comprehensively secure outsourced data sharing mechanism. We design VF-PPBA, the first Verifiable, Fair and Privacy-preserving Broadcast Authorization framework for flexible data sharing in clouds. In more detail, we first invent a new primitive, privacy-preserving multi-recipient broadcast proxy re-encryption (PPMR-BPRE), which enables the authorization of a given ciphertext to different recipients with efficient ciphertext transformation, and further guarantees that any malicious adversary deduces nothing about the identity of the recipient. Then, we present VF-PPBA for flexible data sharing with PPMR-BPRE as the underlying structure, which in addition to inheriting all the functionalities of PPMR-BPRE, is capable of supporting the verifiability of the outcome correctness of the outsourced conversion task, and being immune to the malicious accusation if the outsourcing outcome is correctly completed. We formalize the adversarial models and render comprehensively strict security proofs to prove the security of our proposed solutions. Its performance is also validated via experimental simulations to showcase the practicability and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) greatly enhances binary anomaly detection capabilities through effective statistical network characterization; nevertheless, the intrusion class differentiation performance is still insufficient. Two related challenges have not been fully explored. 1) Statistical attack characteristics are overemphasized while ignoring inherent attack topologies; sequence features are extracted from whole traffic flows, but the interaction evolution of each IP pair over time is rarely considered, such as in long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). 2) Meeting the need for many high-quality labeled data samples is an expensive and labor-intensive task in large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous networks. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic line graph neural network (DLGNN)-based intrusion detection method with semisupervised learning. Our model converts network traffic into a series of spatiotemporal graphs. A dynamic GNN (DGNN) is employed to extract spatial information from each discrete snapshot and capture the contextual evolution of communication between IP pairs through consecutive snapshots. Moreover, a line graph realizes edge embedding expressions corresponding to network communications and strengthens the message aggregation ability of graph convolution. Experiments on 6 novel datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves 98.15–99.8% accuracy in abnormality detection with fewer labeled samples. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art multiclass performance is achieved, e.g., the average detection accuracy for DDoS across the 6 datasets reaches 95.32%.}

The proposed measure employs the notion of relative distance between the synthetic and original datasets at the dataset level, and can identify the optimally balanced position of the synthetic data in terms of both utility and privacy. In addition, we devise a graphical tool that visually reveals the current utility-privacy trade-off position of the synthetic data.

This work aims to demonstrate the utility of synthetic (both bona fide and PA style) fingerprints in supplying these algorithms with sufficient data to improve the performance of fingerprint PAD algorithms beyond the capabilities when training on a limited amount of publicly available “real” datasets. First, we provide details of our approach in modifying a state-of-the-art generative architecture to synthesize high quality bona fide and PA fingerprints. Then, we provide quantitative and qualitative analysis to verify the quality of our synthetic fingerprints in mimicking the distribution of real data samples. We showcase the utility of our synthetic bona fide and PA fingerprints in training a deep network for fingerprint PAD, which dramatically boosts the performance across three different evaluation datasets compared to an identical model trained on real data alone. Finally, we demonstrate that only 25% of the original (real) dataset is required to obtain similar detection performance when augmenting the training dataset with synthetic data. We make our synthetic dataset and model publicly available to encourage further research on this topic: https://github.com/groszste/SpoofGAN .}

	abstract = {Much of the success of fingerprint recognition is attributed to minutiae-based fingerprint representation. It was believed that minutiae templates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint image, but this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning has resulted in alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the hope that they might offer better recognition accuracy as well as non-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate whether deep fingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the minutiae templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to produce a fingerprint image that could be matched to its source image, deep templates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks than minutiae templates. In particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates yield a TAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a state-of-the-art commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The corresponding attack performance for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep templates using the same commercial matcher yields a TAR of less than 1% for both type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images are matched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for type-I (type-II) attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous fingerprint template inversion studies is an evaluation of the black-box attack performance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art fingerprint matchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae templates are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack evaluations, while fingerprint images generated by deep templates are resistant to black-box evaluations and comparatively less susceptible to white-box evaluations.}

	abstract = {Similarity preserving is a key ingredient of cancellable biometric scheme design. The notion ensures the accuracy performance of the biometric systems can be preserved after the cancellable biometric technique is applied. Random Projection is among the most commonly adopted method in cancellable biometric schemes. However, it is reversible subject to certain conditions, which disrupts the template irreversibility criterion. This invites vulnerabilities for random projection-based schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel transform function, namely Absolute Value Equations Transform (AVET), which non-linearly projects feature vectors to another domain. The transformed templates hold two main merits ensuring the user’s privacy, and maintaining the system’s performance simultaneously. First, by relying on the hardness of the Absolute Value Equations problem, we guarantee that AVET satisfies irreversibility. Second, by using Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma and the inverse triangle inequality, we prove that the proposed approach has the similarity preserving property. Notably, rigorous theoretical proofs and empirical experiments are provided. The efficacy of AVET is comprehensively evaluated on both physiological and behavioral biometrics including face, ear, fingerprint, and gait. With unimodal approach, we achieve competitive performances compared to related algorithms on eight public datasets. Regarding bimodal mode, the AVET surpasses the state-of-the-art technique on all three observed datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to develop a secure transformation to augment the role of Random Projection in the existing cancellable biometric schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose dictionary attacks against speaker verification-a novel attack vector that aims to match a large fraction of speaker population by chance. We introduce a generic formulation of the attack that can be used with various speech representations and threat models. The attacker uses adversarial optimization to maximize raw similarity of speaker embeddings between a seed speech sample and a proxy population. The resulting master voice successfully matches a non-trivial fraction of people in an unknown population. Adversarial waveforms obtained with our approach can match on average 69% of females and 38% of males enrolled in the target system at a strict decision threshold calibrated to yield false alarm rate of 1%. By using the attack with a black-box voice cloning system, we obtain master voices that are effective in the most challenging conditions and transferable between speaker encoders. We also show that, combined with multiple attempts, this attack opens even more to serious issues on the security of these systems.}

	abstract = {Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have emerged as potent hardware primitives owing to their intrinsic properties of being secret key-free, clone-proof, and lightweight. However, PUFs cannot avoid the threats of machine learning modeling and side-channel attacks (SCAs). Nevertheless, almost all attacks neglect the correlations between the mathematical model and side-channel models introduced by PUF internal parameters; thus, such attacks fail to exploit related data and struggle in modeling complex PUFs. To address this problem, we propose a framework for using auxiliary learning SCAs to model strong PUFs by learning multiple related tasks together. Side-channel information predictions are introduced as auxiliary tasks to facilitate the primary task of predicting response. The parameters hard for the primary task to learn can be shared by the auxiliary tasks that learn the same parameters more straightforwardly. Based on the proposed framework, we design a specific auxiliary learning power SCA that employs power level prediction as the auxiliary task. The proposed attack is implemented with the hard-parameter sharing and hierarchy sharing deep neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack succeeds in modeling XOR APUF, MPUF, and iPUF and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in modeling MPUF and iPUF. We evaluate the influences of task relatedness, architecture, and loss weight ratio. Furthermore, we propose a fine-grained classification-based method to generate the auxiliary task with an enhanced relationship to the primary task. According to the response, the class corresponding to a specific side-channel state is further divided into two subclasses. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated auxiliary task promotes performance and alleviates the adverse effects of improper architecture and parameters.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy by exchanging gradients instead of local training data. However, these private data can still be reconstructed from the exchanged gradients. Deep leakage from gradients (DLG) is a classical reconstruction attack that optimizes dummy data to real data by making the corresponding dummy and real gradients as similar as possible. Nevertheless, DLG fails with highly compressed gradients, which are crucial for communication-efficient FL. In this study, we propose an effective data reconstruction attack against highly compressed gradients, called highly compressed gradient leakage attack (HCGLA). In particular, HCGLA is characterized by the following three key techniques: 1) Owing to the unreasonable optimization objective of DLG in compression scenarios, we redesign a plausible objective function, ensuring that compressed dummy gradients are similar to the compressed real gradients. 2) Instead of simply initializing dummy data through random noise, as in DLG, we design a novel dummy data initialization method, Init-Generation, to compensate for information loss caused by gradient compression. 3) To further enhance reconstruction quality, we train an ad hoc denoising model using the methods of “first optimizing, next filtering, and then reoptimizing”. Extensive experiments on various benchmark data sets and mainstream models show that HCGLA is an effective reconstruction attack even against highly compressed gradients of 0.1%, whereas state-of-the-art attacks can only support 70% compression, thereby achieving a 700-fold improvement.}

This problem is formulated as a sequential adversarial hypothesis testing game played between the decision maker and the adversary. This game is a zero-sum and strategic one. We assume the adversary is active under all hypotheses and knows the underlying distribution of observed samples. We adopt this framework as it is the worst-case scenario from the perspective of the decision maker. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the expectation of the stopping time to ensure that the test is as efficient as possible; the adversary’s goal is, instead, to maximize the stopping time. We derive a pair of strategies under which the asymptotic Nash equilibrium of the game is attained. We also consider the case in which the adversary is not aware of the underlying hypothesis and hence is constrained to apply the same strategy regardless of which hypothesis is in effect. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings.}

Currently, considerable linguistic steganalysis methods are proposed to detect harmful steganographic carriers. However, almost all the existing methods fail in real social networks, since they are only devoted to the linguistic features that are extreme insufficient owing to the extreme sparsity and extreme fragmentation challenges of real social networks. In this paper, we attempt to fill the long-standing gap that the datasets and effective methods are absent for hunting steganographic texts in social network scenarios. Concretely, we construct a dataset called Stego-Sandbox to simulate the real social network scenarios, which contains texts and their relation. And we propose an effective linguistic steganalysis framework integrating linguistic features contained in texts and context features represented by these connections. Extensive experimental results demonstrate owing to the captured context features, our proposed framework can effectively compensate for shortcomings of these existing methods and tremendously improve their detection ability in real social network scenarios.}

We analyze the arms race of the game and derive an optimal frequency hopping policy at each stage of the arms race based on the Markov decision process (MDP). It is analytically shown that the arms race reaches an equilibrium after a few rounds, and a frequency hopping policy and a jamming strategy at the equilibrium are characterized. We propose two kinds of collision avoidance protocols to ensure that at most one user communicates in each frequency band, and provide various numerical results that show the effects of the reward parameters and collision avoidance protocols on the optimal frequency hopping policy and the expected rewards at the equilibrium. Moreover, we discuss about equilibria for the case where the jammer adopts some unpredictable jamming strategies.}

	abstract = {The advance of cloud computing has driven a new paradigm of outsourcing large-scale data and data-driven services to public clouds. Due to the increased awareness of privacy protection, many studies have focused on addressing security and privacy issues in outsourced query services. Although many privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed for various query types, the set reverse k nearest neighbors (RkNN) query is still an unexplored area. Even if some existing schemes can be adapted to achieve privacy-preserving set RkNN queries, they will suffer from linear search efficiency. As a steppingstone, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving set RkNN query scheme over encrypted data with sublinear query efficiency. Specifically, we first design an inverted prefix index to organize the set dataset and propose an algorithm to traverse the index with sublinear search efficiency. Then, we propose two oblivious data comparison protocols based on a symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE) scheme and design the private filter/refinement protocols to preserve the privacy of index searching. After that, we propose an access pattern privacy-preserving set RkNN query scheme by using private filter/refinement protocols. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that our scheme can protect data privacy and access pattern privacy. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is more efficient than the available naive solution in terms of computational costs and communication overheads.}

To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called\nAgroMobiBlock\n. The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs.\nAgroMobiBlock\nproposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs.

The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes.

	abstract = {In a broad range of commercial and government applications, supporting secure location-based query services over outsourced cloud-based services particularly for data update on encrypted datasets remains challenging in practice. Compounding the challenge is the need to ensure update and query efficiency, dataset confidentiality (including against potentially malicious cloud service providers) and query authenticity. Thus in this paper, we propose DynPilot, a novel solution for privacy-preserving verifiable location-based skyline queries over dynamic and encrypted data(sets). The key challenge is how to devise a ciphertext-based authenticated data structure (ADS) that not only protects the confidentiality of the dataset (including the verification phase), but also the effective maintenance of such a dataset. Moreover, to motivate the cloud into actively updating ADS, the digest of the raw dataset is stored in the blockchain due to its immutability and consensus mechanism where update cost is also considered. Therefore, we present a novel ADS (hereafter referred to as D ynamic-Efficient S ecure and V erifiable T ree (DSV-tree)), designed to be dynamic and support secure and verifiable skyline queries. Meanwhile, DynPilot also achieves forward privacy using a novel fuzzy update strategy. To further improve the efficiency of queries, an optimized version (i.e., DSV*-tree) is also developed based on the idea of the multi-level index structure. Finally, we analyze the security and complexity of our approach, and the empirical evaluations demonstrate the utility of our approach.}

	abstract = {Cyber security of modern power systems has become increasingly significant due to their open communication architecture and expanding network connectivity exposed to malicious cyber attacks. Resilient control represents an effective means to preserve the survivability of the power system under cyber attacks. In this paper, we address the resilient load frequency control (LFC) design for multi-area power systems under a new class of time-constrained denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, different from the widely-explored duration- and frequency-constrained DoS attack models, we consider a general time-constrained DoS attack model where only the attack durations are confined into some bounds, which represents less a priori knowledge of an attacker’s actions. Second, instead of using a traditional yet conservative time-invariant Lyapunov function (TILF), we develop an attack-parameter-dependent time-varying Lyapunov function (TVLF) approach to enable a resilient LFC design without jeopardizing the desired closed-loop system stability and performance. Furthermore, we provide a formal stability and performance analysis condition as well as a design criterion for the desired DoS-resilient output feedback LFC controller. We also show that the minimum allowable sleeping period and the maximum allowable active period of the attacked LFC system can be explicitly disclosed. Finally, we present two simulation case studies on a two-area LFC system and a three-area LFC system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power communications by backscattering ambient radio frequency (RF) signals and harvesting energy simultaneously. It has emerged as a cutting-edge technology for supporting a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, existing research lacks effective secret key sharing schemes for safeguarding communications between resource-constrained backscatter devices (BDs) in AmBC systems. In this paper, we present, Tri-Channel, a novel physical layer key generation scheme between two BDs by multiplying downlink signals and backscatter signals to obtain the information of a triangle channel as a shared random secret source for key generation. In particular, we analyze the security of our scheme under both passive and active attacks, concretely Eavesdropping Attack (EA), Control Channel Attack (CCA), Signal Manipulative Attack (SMA), and Untrusted RF-Source Attack (URSA). Through theoretical analysis and simulations by comparing with a traditional scheme (named Tradi-Channel), we found that our scheme consistently outperforms the Tradi-Channel under the EA and two active attacks (CCA and SMA). In addition, it shows better security performance under URSA, which is proposed based on the unauthenticated characteristic of BDs in Tri-Channel, even though URSA is more vital than SMA. Concretely, Tri-Channel’s secret key rate (SKR) outperforms Tradi-Channel’s under the above four passive and active attacks. This implies that our scheme is advanced in terms of both security and efficiency of key generation. Numerous extensive simulations further prove our theoretical analysis results.}

	abstract = {Due to millions of heterogeneous physical nodes, multiple-vendor and multi-tenant domains, and technologies etc., 5G has greatly expanded the threat landscape. Particularly from the high rate of traffic and ultra-low latency requirement of applications in 5G networks, the detection of the network traffic anomalies in real-time is critical. The conventional security approaches lack compatibility with modern network designs and are not much effective in 5G settings. We propose a two-stage network traffic anomaly detection system compatible with ETSI-NFV standard 5G architecture. Our architecture consists of two modules, i.e., (a) Dimensionality Reduction to compress the sample size at the edge of 5G networks and (b) Deep Neural Network classifier (DNN) that detects traffic anomalies. We have conducted our experiments using OMNET++ and ETSI-NFV (OSM MANO) 5G orchestration real platform deployed on AWS cloud systems. We have used the UNSW-NB15 data set and have shown that at dimensionality reduction factor of 81% the detection accuracy obtained is 98%. The proposal is compared with other recent approaches to show the overall merit of the architecture.}

	abstract = {A bus-off attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which exploits error handling in the controller area network (CAN) to induce an honest node to disconnect itself from the CAN bus. This paper develops a stochastic transmission policy as a countermeasure for the controller-transmitter pair against the bus-off attack. We model this as a non-zero-sum linear-quadratic-Gaussian game between the controller-transmitter pair and the attacker. We derive Nash equilibria of the game for two different information structures of the attacker. We show that the attacker has a dominant attack strategy under both information structures. Under the dominant attack strategy, we show that the optimal control policy is linear in the system state. We further identify a necessary and a sufficient conditions on the transmission policy to have bounded average cost. The theoretical results are complemented by a detailed case study of a bus-off attack on a vehicular adaptive cruise control model.}

	abstract = {In a model inversion attack, an adversary attempts to reconstruct the training data records of a target model using only the model’s output. In launching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are generally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box attacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However, in the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the confidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method that can reconstruct representative samples of the target model’s training data based only on the output labels. We believe this attack requires the least information to succeed and, therefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error rate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data records to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance is then used to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack model to reconstruct the representative samples. The experimental results show that highly recognizable representative samples can be reconstructed with far less information than existing methods.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving decision trees (DTs) in vertical federated learning are one of the most effective tools to facilitate various privacy-critical applications in reality. However, the main bottleneck of current solutions is their huge overhead, mainly due to the adoption of communication-heavy bit decomposition to realize complex non-linear operations, such as comparison and division. In this paper, we present PriVDT , an efficient two-party framework for private vertical DT training and inference in the offline/online paradigm. Specifically, we customize several cryptographic building blocks based on an advanced primitive, Function Secret Sharing (FSS). First, we construct an optimized comparison protocol to improve the efficiency via reducing the invocation of FSS evaluations. Second, we devise an efficient and privacy-enhanced division protocol without revealing the range of divisors, which utilizes the above comparison protocol and more importantly new designed FSS-based secure range and digital decomposition protocols. Besides, we further reduce the overhead of linear operations by employing lightweight pseudorandom function-based Beaver’s triple techniques. Building on the above efficient components, we implement the PriVDT framework and evaluate it on 5 real-world datasets on both LAN and WAN. Experimental results show that the end-to-end runtime of PriVDT outperforms the prior art by\n42∼510×\non LAN and\n16∼70×\non WAN. Moreover, PriVDT provides comparable accuracy to the non-private setting.}

	abstract = {Aiming at balancing data privacy and availability, Google introduces the concept of federated learning, which can construct global machine learning models over multiple participants while keeping their raw data localized. However, the exchanged parameters in traditional federated learning may still reveal the data information. Meanwhile, the training data are usually partitioned vertically in real-world scenes, which causes difficulties in model construction. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving vertical federated tree boosting framework, namely SGBoost, where multiple participants can collaboratively perform model training and query without staying online all the time. Specifically, we first design secure bucket sharing and best split finding algorithms, with which the global tree model can be constructed over vertically partitioned data; meanwhile, the privacy of training data can be well guaranteed. Then, we design an oblivious query algorithm to utilize the trained model without leaking any query data or results. Moreover, SGBoost does not require multi-round interactions between participants, significantly improving the system efficiency. Detailed security analysis shows that SGBoost can well guarantee the privacy of raw data, weights, buckets, and split information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGBoost can achieve high accuracy comparable to centralized training and efficient performance.}

	abstract = {In recent years, face forgery detectors have aroused great interest and achieved impressive performance, but they are still struggling with generalization and robustness. In this work, we explore taking full advantage of the fine-grained forgery traces in both spatial and frequency domains to alleviate this issue. Specifically, we propose a novel High-Frequency Fine-Grained Transformer (F2Trans) network which contains two important components, namely Central Difference Attention (CDA) and High-frequency Wavelet Sampler (HWS). The premier CDA module is capable of capturing invariant fine-grained manipulation patterns by aggregating both pixel-level intensity and gradient information of the query to generate key and value pairs. Subsequently, the proposed HWS discards the low-frequency components of wavelet transformation and hierarchically explores high-frequency forgery cues of feature maps, which prevents model confusion caused by low-frequency components and pays attention to local frequency information. In addition, HWS can be employed as a special pooling layer for the F2Trans architecture to produce hierarchical feature representations in the spatial-frequency domain. Extensive experiments on multiple popular benchmarks demonstrate the generalization and robustness of the specially designed F2Trans framework is well-tailored for face forgery detection when confronting the cross-dataset, cross-manipulation, and unseen perturbations.}

	abstract = {Data availability is the major concern of outsourced data storage services. While reliability is promoted by many storage providers, it is infeasible for users to verify these claims. Proofs of Storage-Time are proposed to address this issue: they allow a prover to convince a verifier that the prover indeed stores the outsourced data continuously during the whole storage period. These protocols, however, either fail to guarantee the actual duration of data possession, or require the client to perform a computationally expensive storing process for each file, marking them far from being practical. We present\nePoSt\n, the first secure, stateless and efficient Proof of Storage-Time protocol with public verifiability. Not only does it ensure continuous data availability, but it also minimizes the cost of the client, which is crucial for real-world deployment. Specifically, processing a 1GB file for outsourcing, in anticipation for 3 proof/verify interactions, each attesting a period of 1 year at 25 minutes intervals requires only 66.34 minutes. In contrast, state-of-the-art solution requires 51 hours of processing to prepare a file for outsourcing. Proof size and verification remains at a reasonable cost: a proof is of size 48.82KB, and can be verified in 36.05 ms. Furthermore, our solution enjoys public verifiability and remains stateless. The former allows the data owner to outsource the verification process, and the latter allows unlimited number of proofs and verification to be conducted after the file has been stored. These properties make\nePoSt\nparticularly suitable for new business models such as decentralised storage networks (e.g., Filecoin).}

The friendly interferer has access to limited power, while the eavesdropper may not have the ability to attack all channels simultaneously. When all channels used for secret communication are under the threat of eavesdropping attacks, the optimal power allocation policy results from solving a convex optimization problem. In this case, the optimal policy is unique and can be obtained via a water-filling scheme. When the eavesdropper can not attack all channels, the eavesdropper should behave strategically and may select targets probabilistically. We propose a non-zero-sum game that helps the friendly interferer predict and concentrate on the targets selected by the eavesdropper. Under certain conditions, we prove that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy pair, which has a threshold type structure. We provide conditions under which the eavesdropper’s equilibrium strategy is deterministic. We devise a strategy iteration algorithm to compute an equilibrium power allocation strategy. We present examples showing that the game-theoretic power allocation strategy performs better than the conservative power allocation strategy that assumes every channel to be under attack.}

	abstract = {Copy-move forgery is a manipulation of copying and pasting specific patches from and to an image, with potentially illegal or unethical uses. Recent advances in the forensic methods for copy-move forgery have shown increasing success in detection accuracy and robustness. However, for images with high self-similarity or strong signal corruption, the existing algorithms often exhibit inefficient processes and unreliable results. This is mainly due to the inherent semantic gap between low-level visual representation and high-level semantic concept. In this paper, we present a very first study of trying to mitigate the semantic gap problem in copy-move forgery detection, with spatial pooling of local moment invariants for midlevel image representation. Our detection method expands the traditional works on two aspects: 1) we introduce the bag-of-visual-words model into this field for the first time, may meaning a new perspective of forensic study; 2) we propose a word-to-phrase feature description and matching pipeline, covering the spatial structure and visual saliency information of digital images. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of our framework over state-of-the-art algorithms in overcoming the related problems caused by the semantic gap.}

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a new paradigm for building intelligent industrial control systems, and how to establish a secure channel in IIoT for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a critical problem because the devices in IIoT suffer from various attacks and may leak confidential information. Traditional authenticated and confidential channel establishment (ACCE) protocols neither apply for resource-constrained IIoT devices nor satisfy leakage resilience. In this paper, we introduce a new security notion: historical data based multi-factor ACCE (HMACCE) to address this issue and propose two HMACCE protocols. Our HMACCE protocols use three authentication factors, i.e., a symmetric secret key, historical data, and a set of secret tags associated with the historical data, to establish a secure communication channel between the client and the server. The key idea is to use the secret key managed by an IIoT edge device to quickly verify the relationship between the historical data and its associated tags stored on the server. Our HMACCE has the following remarkable features. First, it is lightweight and tailored for resource-constrained IIoT devices. Second, it is bounded historical tag leakage resilience, which means that if a small portion of the secret tags is leaked to an adversary, it will not affect its security with an overwhelming probability. Moreover, as a security enhancement service, our HMACCE can be easily integrated with legacy IIoT devices by running simple authenticated key exchange protocols.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new DeepFakes forensics approach called forensic symmetry, which determines whether two symmetrical face patches contain the same or different natural features. To do this, we propose a multi-stream learning structure composed of two feature extractors. The first feature extractor obtains symmetry feature from the front face images. The second feature extractor obtains similarity feature from the side face images. Symmetry feature and similarity feature are collectively called natural feature. Forensic symmetry system maps the pair of symmetrical face patches into the angular hyperspace to quantify the difference of their natural features. The greater the difference of natural features, the higher the tamper probability of face images. The heuristic prediction algorithm is designed to compute the tamper probability of DeepFakes at video level. A series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed forensic symmetry system. Experimental results show that our approach is effective for DeepFakes detection under the scenarios of homologous detection, heterogeneous detection, and re- compression detection.}

	abstract = {Proactive eavesdropping is an effective approach to legitimately surveil the suspicious communications. Current studies all considered that physical layer security (PLS) techniques such as the wiretap coding are not applied by the suspicious users (SUs) to protect their communications. Contrary to that, we consider that the wiretap coding in PLS is adopted by the SUs to defend against the proactive eavesdropping from the legitimate monitor over fading channels. Under the fixed power allocation (FPA) and the water-filling power allocation (WFPA) at the SUs, the problem of jamming power allocation at the monitor to maximize the relative eavesdropping rate under the average transmit power constraint is investigated. The optimization problem is solved by two nested optimizations, where the bisection search method is used in the outer optimization, and the Lagrange duality method and the successive convex approximation method are used in the inner optimization. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to various baseline algorithms. It is shown that the proposed algorithm under the WFPA at the SUs outperforms the one under the FPA at the SUs, and the monitor achieves lower relative eavesdropping rate when the SUs adopt a stricter secure transmission scheme.}

	abstract = {Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a crucial role in securing face recognition systems. Empirically, given an image, a model with more consistent output on different views (i.e., augmentations) of this image usually performs better. Motivated by this exciting observation, we conjecture that encouraging feature consistency of different views may be a promising way to boost FAS models. In this paper, we explore this way thoroughly by enhancing both Embedding-level and Prediction-level Consistency Regularization (EPCR) in FAS. Specifically, at the embedding level, we design a dense similarity loss to maximize the similarities between all positions of two intermediate feature maps in a self-supervised fashion; while at the prediction level, we optimize the mean square error between the predictions of two views. Notably, our EPCR is free of annotations and can directly integrate into semi-supervised learning schemes. Considering different application scenarios, we further design five diverse semi-supervised protocols to measure semi-supervised FAS techniques. We conduct extensive experiments to show that EPCR can significantly improve the performance of several supervised and semi-supervised tasks on benchmark datasets. The codes and protocols are available at https://github.com/clks-wzz/EPCR .}

	abstract = {Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain ecosystem that supports execution of smart contracts, the key enablers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). However, the expressiveness of Ethereum smart contracts is a double-edged sword: while it enables blockchain programmability, it also introduces security vulnerabilities, i.e., the exploitable discrepancies between expected and actual behaviors of the contract code. To address these discrepancies and increase the vulnerability coverage, we propose a new smart contract security testing approach called transaction encapsulation. The core idea lies in the local execution of transactions on a fully-synchronized yet isolated Ethereum node, which creates a preview of outcomes of transaction sequences on the current state of blockchain. This approach poses a critical technical challenge — the well-known time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) problem, i.e., the assurance that the final transactions will exhibit the same execution paths as the encapsulated test transactions. In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed execution path replicability of the tested transactions. To demonstrate the transaction encapsulation, we implement a transaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes (either benign or malicious) of Ethereum transactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically verifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution path on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum transactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We further show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated with 31 out of 37 vulnerabilities (83.8% coverage) in the smart contract weakness classification (SWC) registry. In comparison, the vulnerability coverage of all the existing defense approaches combined only reaches 40.5%.}

	abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs: digital collections of patient health status and diagnosis) are generally shared, analyzed and stored on cloud servers. One operational challenge is to ensure that EHRs are stored correctly, for example using provable data possession (PDP). Seeking to contribute to the literature, we propose a certificateless PDP scheme for cloud-based EHRs. In our scheme, we distribute multiple copies of EHRs on different cloud servers to allow for corrupted EHRs to be recoverable from other intact copies. The scheme is also designed to resist copy-summation attack which assures that cloud servers are storing EHRs honestly. In our approach, EHRs are stored in ciphertext form so that only authorized users can decrypt and gain access to the information. We also design a new data structure – map version marker table (MVMT) – for block-level dynamic operations and data traceability. Specifically, MVMT allows an authorized doctor to access historical EHRs to inform their diagnosis and decision-making. The security and performance analyses show that our scheme is secure (assuming the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem) and is practical to support cloud-based EHR applications.}

In such a data sharing model, not only the privacy preservation for the data and queries but also the trustworthiness of the underlying billing system is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we revisit multi-key searchable encryption (MKSE), an efficient and secure data search algorithm allowing a data owner to grant users the ability to retrieve data of interest over the outsourced, encrypted datasets. We first investigate which factor in existing MKSE schemes renders authorized users over-privileged such that, without risking their credits (e.g., leaking the private keys and/or the passwords for their accounts associated with a project where the shared data resides), they can allow unauthorized users to make valid queries. Unfortunately, this concern may be devastating because the queries made by unauthorized users would incur unexpected financial damage to the owner in practical pay-per-query models. We then propose a novel multi-key data search scheme that is resilient to unauthorized queries. The proposed scheme features a novel user authorization mechanism that carefully limits user privilege such that even an authorized user cannot illegally invite unauthorized users to query unless he entirely leaks his credit. We demonstrate the proposed scheme is comparable to prior work in terms of performance while achieving a higher level of security.}

	abstract = {Large-scale cropping (LSC) is one of the mostly-used operations in desynchronization attacks and can easily destroy the watermark information by deleting continuous audio slices from the watermarked audio. In this work, we propose a spread spectrum (SS) based audio watermarking scheme to resist against LSC attacks more robustly from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Specifically, we first perform discrete wavelet transform (DWT), graph-based transform (GBT), and singular value decomposition (SVD) on the host audio signal to produce transform coefficients. Next, we embed the chaotic encrypted watermark into DWT-GBT-SVD coefficients by the SS technique. Then, we combine m-sequences with the encrypted watermark to generate the watermarking key, which can theoretically guarantee the self-restoration of the cropped watermark based on the periodicity of m-sequences. Additionally, we develop an effective sliding window (SW) strategy to extract the fragmentary watermark slices from DWT-GBT-SVD coefficients and restore the integral watermark by the watermarking key. Finally, the proposed audio watermarking scheme, named m-SW-LSC, is compared with the state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods on audio signals with different genres and lengths under various attacks with different ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our m-SW-LSC has a superior performance in restoring the complete watermark and exhibits significantly high robustness against LSC attacks.}

A long neglected but important fact is that data privacy is a non-replenishable resource and should be carefully scheduled to maximize its utility gain. In this work, we propose a new privacy budgeting system—DPlanner, which estimates data blocks’ importance to queries and assigns fractional privacy budget to those data blocks contributing most to a query. The scheduler is novelly designed to include two-fold randomness, which satisfies differential privacy with tight budgets, at the same time guarantees the expected utility in the worst-case query sequence when queries arrive in an online fashion. Experiments in a variety of machine learning settings have shown that our DPlanner outperforms the state-of-the-art schedulers by serving at least 25% more queries, or reducing the total privacy consumption by over 50%.}

Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.}

Therefore, Sybil detection is a fundamental task for OSN security. Most existing Sybil detection methods are based on the graph structure of OSNs, and various methods have been proposed recently. However, although almost all methods have been compared experimentally in terms of detection performance and noise robustness, theoretical understanding of them is still lacking. In this study, we show that existing graph-based Sybil detection methods can be interpreted in a unified framework of low-pass filtering. This framework enables us to theoretically compare and analyze each method from two perspectives: filter kernel properties and the spectrum of shift matrices. Our analysis reveals that the detection performance of each method depends on the effectiveness of the low-pass filtering. Furthermore, on the basis of the analysis, we propose a novel Sybil detection method called SybilHeat. Numerical experiments on synthetic graphs and real social networks demonstrate that SybilHeat performs consistently well on graphs with various structural properties. This study lays a theoretical foundation for graph-based Sybil detection and leads to a better understanding of Sybil detection methods.}

	abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and compelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Smart contracts from various fields now hold over one trillion dollars worth of virtual coins, attracting numerous attacks. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state of the contract and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence $\\mathcal {S}_{1}$ by appending a new sequence $\\mathcal {S}_{2}$ , so that the appended sequence $\\mathcal {S}_{2}$ can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state; 2) we incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch; 3) we engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods, and (iii) IR-Fuzz is fast, generating an average of 350 test cases per second. Our implementation and dataset are released at https://github.com/Messi-Q/IR-Fuzz , hoping to facilitate future research.}

However, these services raise the issue of leaking users’ sensitive attributes, such as race, when provided through the cloud. The present work overcomes this issue by proposing an innovative privacy-preserving approach called privacy-preserving class overlap (PPCO), which incorporates both a Wasserstein generative adversarial network and the idea of class overlapping to obfuscate data for better resilience against the leakage of attribute-inference attacks(i.e., malicious inference on users’ sensitive attributes). Experiments show that the proposed method can be employed to enhance current state-of-the-art works and achieve superior privacy–utility trade-off. Furthermore, the proposed method is shown to be less susceptible to the influence of imbalanced classes in training data. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the performance of our proposed method to give a flavour of the gap between theoretical and empirical performances.}

	abstract = {With the ubiquitous adoption, mobile face authentication systems have been facing constant security challenges, particularly the spoofing risks. Except for those using specialized hardware, existing proposals for face anti-spoofing on mainstream smartphones either leverage people’s 3D face characteristics or various facial expressions. While showing progress towards more resilient face authentication, they are still vulnerable to recent advanced attacks (e.g., 3D mask attacks, video attacks, etc.). This paper presents GazeGuard, an on-device face anti-spoofing system that leverages unpredictable and unforgeable eye movement patterns to provide strong security guarantees against all known attacks. Targeting mainstream smartphones, GazeGuard is designed to conduct eye movement-based authentication using only 2D front cameras. Specifically, by presenting a series of short-lasting random dots on the screen (named gazecode), GazeGuard simultaneously captures a user’s gaze responses and the corresponding deformed periocular features to ensure both the freshness and correctness for the anti-spoofing face authentication. We have extensively tested GazeGuard’s performance over 50 volunteers. Using a 4-digit gazecode (just four random dots), GazeGuard achieves an average 90.39% authentication accuracy and 81.57 out of 100 System Usability Scale (SUS) scores. Under the same settings, GazeGuard achieves detection accuracy of 95.72% for image attack, 95.59% for video attack, 99.73% for 3D mask attack, and 100% for physical adversarial attack.}

	abstract = {Partial occlusion of the human body caused by obstacles or a limited camera field of view often occurs in surveillance videos, which affects the performance of gait recognition in practice. Existing methods for gait recognition against occlusion require a bounding box or the height of a full human body as a prerequisite, which is unobserved in occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware model-based gait recognition method that works directly on gait videos under occlusion without the above-mentioned prerequisite. Specifically, given a gait sequence that only contains non-occluded body parts in the images, we directly fit a skinned multi-person linear (SMPL)-based human mesh model to the input images without any pre-normalization or registration of the human body. We further use the pose and shape features extracted from the estimated SMPL model for recognition purposes, and use the extracted camera parameters in the occlusion attenuation module to reduce intra-subject variation in human model fitting caused by occlusion pattern differences. Experiments on occlusion samples simulated from the OU-MVLP dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperformed state-of-the-art gait recognition methods by about 15% rank-1 identification rate and 2% equal error rate in the identification and verification scenarios, respectively.}

	abstract = {To generate image adversarial examples, state-of-the-art black-box attacks usually require thousands of queries. However, massive queries will introduce additional costs and exposure risks in the real world. Towards improving the attack efficiency, we carefully design an acceleration framework SAGE for existing black-box methods, which is composed of sLocator (initial point optimization) and sRudder (search process optimization). The core idea of SAGE in terms of 1) saliency map can guide the perturbations towards the most adversarial direction and 2) exploiting bounding box (bbox) to capture those salient pixels in the black-box attack. Meanwhile, we provide a series of observations and experiments that demonstrate bbox holds model invariance and process invariance. We extensively evaluate SAGE on four state-of-the-art black-box attacks involving three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet). The results show that SAGE could present fundamental improvements even against robust models that use adversarial training. Specifically, SAGE could reduce >20% of queries and improve the success rate of attacks to 95%~100%. Compared with the other acceleration framework, SAGE fulfills the more significant effect in a flexible, stable, and low-overhead manner. Moreover, our practical evaluation (Google Cloud Vision API) shows SAGE can be applied to real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Path validation has already been incrementally deployed in the Internet architecture. It secures packet forwarding by enabling end hosts to negotiate specific forwarding paths and enforcing on-path routers to prove their forwarding behaviors along these paths. Most existing path validation solutions target static paths, paying less attention to fully dynamic paths that support flexible routing. In this paper, we present Hummingbird as the first validation solution over fully dynamic paths. It features a hidden equal-probability sampling technique. Gaining efficiency via routers probabilistically sampling packets to validate, we craft the sampling probability such that each router validates a similar amount of packets given an unknown path length. We further hide the state of whether a packet has been sampled and validated using a lightweight, non-cryptographic scheme. This prevents attackers from differentiating and selectively mis-forwarding packets. We validate security and efficiency of Hummingbird through both theoretical proof and experimental evaluation.}

	abstract = {Finger vein biometrics is becoming an important source of human authentication due to its advantages in terms of liveness detection, high security, and user convenience. Although there exist a lot of deep learning-based methods for finger vein authentication, they only extract features from finger vein images in the spatial domain and may lose some important information that is present in other domains, such as the frequency domain. Motivated by this conjecture and the remarkable performance of image feature extraction in the frequency domain, this work explores a method capable of extracting finger vein features in both the spatial and frequency domains. Therefore, the features extracted from different domains can complement each other. In addition, we propose a novel frequency-spatial coupling network (FVFSNet) for finger vein authentication. FVFSNet is mainly composed of three parts: (1) the frequency domain processing module (FDPM), (2) the spatial domain processing module (SDPM), and (3) the frequency-spatial coupling module (FSCM). The FDPM is used to extract the finger vein features present in the frequency domain, which is mainly composed of the frequency-spatial domain transformation and the frequency domain convolution layer. The SDPM is used to extract the finger vein features present in the spatial domain, which is mainly composed of convolution layers with an efficient design. The FSCM is used to couple the features extracted from the FDPM and SDPM, which is mainly composed of the channel and spatial attention mechanisms. To validate our conjecture and the performances of FVFSNet, extensive experiments are conducted on nine commonly used publicly available finger vein datasets. Experimental results show that the frequency domain constitutional neural network has a surprising effect on finger vein authentication, and the proposed FVFSNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance with the advantages of lightweight and low computational cost.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Deepfake synthesis technology, our information security and personal privacy have been severely threatened in recent years. To achieve a robust Deepfake detection, researchers attempt to exploit the joint spatial-temporal information in the videos, like using recurrent networks and 3D convolutional networks. However, these spatial-temporal models remain room to improve. Another general challenge for spatial-temporal models is that people do not clearly understand what these spatial-temporal models really learn. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose an Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Video Transformer (ISTVT), which consists of a novel decomposed spatial-temporal self-attention and a self-subtract mechanism to capture spatial artifacts and temporal inconsistency for robust Deepfake detection. Thanks to this decomposition, we propose to interpret ISTVT by visualizing the discriminative regions for both spatial and temporal dimensions via the relevance (the pixel-wise importance on the input) propagation algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including FaceForensics++, FaceShifter, DeeperForensics, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets. Our strong performance of intra-dataset and cross-dataset Deepfake detection demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our method, and our visualization-based interpretability offers people insights into our model.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are one of today’s major threats to cyber security. Highly determined attackers along with novel and evasive exfiltration techniques mean APT attacks elude most intrusion detection and prevention systems. The result has been significant losses for governments, organizations, and commercial entities. Intriguingly, despite greater efforts to defend against APTs in recent times, frequent upgrades in defense strategies are not leading to increased security and protection. In this paper, we demonstrate this phenomenon in an appropriately designed APT rivalry game that captures the interactions between attackers and defenders. What is shown is that the defender’s strategy adjustments actually leave useful information for the attackers, and thus intelligent and rational attackers can improve themselves by analyzing this information. Hence, a critical part of one’s defense strategy must be finding a suitable time to adjust one’s strategy to ensure attackers learn the least possible information. Another challenge for defenders is determining how to make the best use of one’s resources to achieve a satisfactory defense level. In support of these efforts, we figured out the optimal timings of a player’s strategy adjustment in terms of information leakage, which form a family of Nash equilibria. Moreover, two learning mechanisms are proposed to help defenders find an appropriate defense level and allocate their resources reasonably. One is based on adversarial bandits, and the other is based on deep reinforcement learning. Experimental simulations show the rationales behind the game and the optimality of the equilibria. The results also demonstrate that players indeed have the ability to improve themselves by learning from past experiences, which shows the necessity of specifying optimal strategy adjustment timings when defending against APTs.}

	abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) emanation measurement and evaluation is one important testing for modern integrated circuits (ICs). Severe electromagnetic interference may degrade the performance of electronic devices or even cause system crashes. As a result, modern ICs need to follow strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements. Moreover, EM emanations offer a covert channel for adversaries to steal secret information from fabricated ICs, causing side channel attacks. Due to the lack of fast and high-accuracy EM simulation tools, existing EM measurements often happen at the post-silicon stage. Any identification of side channel vulnerability or EM incompatibility may lead to high cost and delay the time-to-market. As a result, design-time EM simulation tools with fast simulation speed and high accuracy for pre-silicon designs are urgently needed. To this end, we propose EMSIM, a layout-level EM simulation framework that significantly speeds up the EM simulation process while maintaining high accuracy of the simulated EM emanations. To achieve this goal, we provide the theoretical explanation for the root cause of EM emanations from ICs. Guiding by this, EMSIM leverages techniques of parasitic network reduction and device model approximation to reduce the computation complexities while still ensuring high simulation accuracy. EMSIM further leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources to solve equations for EM simulation. The efficiency and effectiveness of EMSIM are validated by showing the consistency between simulation results and physical measurements obtained from fabricated circuit designs.}

	abstract = {Recent on-manifold adversarial attacks can mislead gait recognition by generating adversarial walking postures (AWP) with image generation techniques. However, existing defense methods only eliminate adversarial perturbations on each frame isolatedly but ignore the temporal correlation of gait sequence, which leads to vulnerability of robust gait recognition. In this paper, we propose GaitReload, a post-processing adversarial defense method to defend against AWP for the gait recognition model with sequenced inputs. First, GaitReload utilizes sequenced entity recognition (SER) module to detect the adversarial frames by the temporal constraints of gait sequence. Then, we apply bayesian uncertainty filtering-based (BUF-based) gait interpolation to reform adversarial gait examples. After that, we reload the reformed gait sequence and rectify the recognition results with the guidance of reloading strategy. Specifically, SER has a bi-directional frame difference attention and a temporal feature aggregation to boost the detection performance. For training SER, we apply hidden posture selective attack (HPSA) to generate training samples. The extensive experimental results on CASIA-A, CASIA-B, and OU-ISIR demonstrate that GaitReload can defend against adversarial gait by large margins in both RGB and silhouette modes.}

To achieve secure and reliable transmission, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided robust multi-beam array transceiver scheme. Leveraging beamforming, we aim to minimize transmit power by jointly designing the information and AN beamforming, while satisfying valid reception for legitimate users (LUs), per-antenna power constraints for transmitter, as well as all interception power constraints for eavesdroppers (Eves). In particular, the interception power formulation is taken into account for protecting the information against hybrid Eves with imperfect AE channel state information (CSI) and no PE CSI. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by replacing non-convex constraints with tractable forms. Afterwards, a two-stage algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution. Additionally, we design the received beamforming weights by means of minimum variance distortionless response, such that the jamming caused by AEs can be effectively suppressed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency and security.}

	abstract = {In the field of information security, the unpredictability of random numbers plays determinant role according to the security of cryptographic systems. However, limited by the capability of pattern recognition and data mining, statistical-based methods for random number security assessment can only detect whether there are obvious statistical flaws in random sequences. In recent years, some machine learning-based techniques such as deep neural networks and prediction-based methods applied to random number security have exhibited superior performance. Concurrently, the proposed deep learning models bring out issues of large number of parameters, high storage space occupation and complex computation. In this paper, for the challenge of random number security analysis: building high-performance predictive models, we propose an effective analysis method based on pruning and quantized deep neural network. Firstly, we train a temporal pattern attention-based long short-term memory (TPA-LSTM) model with complex structure and good prediction performance. Secondly, through pruning and quantization operations, the complexity and storage space occupation of the TPA-LSTM model were reduced. Finally, we retrain the network to find the best model and evaluate the effectiveness of this method using various simulated data sets with known min-entropy values. By comparing with related work, the TPA-LSTM model provides more accurate estimates: the relative error is less than 0.43%. In addition, the model weight parameters are reduced by more than 98% and quantized to 2 bits (compression over 175x) without accuracy loss.}

While earlier studies have revealed the benefits of ensemble methods, and in particular, a multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach to the problem, one limitation of such techniques is that they treat the entire observation space similarly and ignore any variability and local structure inherent to the data. This work studies this aspect of face presentation attack detection with regards to one-class multiple kernel learning to benefit from the intrinsic local structure in bona fide samples to adaptively weight each representation in the composite kernel. More concretely, drawing on the one-class Fisher null formalism, we formulate a convex localised multiple kernel learning algorithm by regularising the collection of local kernel weights via a joint matrix-norm constraint and infer locally adaptive kernel weights for zero-shot one-class unseen attack detection. We present a theoretical study of the proposed localised MKL algorithm using Rademacher complexities to characterise its generalisation capability and demonstrate its advantages over some other options. An assessment of the proposed approach on general object image datasets illustrates its efficacy for anomaly and novelty detection while the results of the experiments on face PAD datasets verify its potential in detecting unknown/unseen face presentation attacks.}

	abstract = {With advances in social engineering tricks and other technical shortcomings, ransomware attacks have become a severe cybercrime affecting organizations of all shapes and sizes. Although the security teams are making plenty of ransomware detection tools, the ransomware incident report shows they are ineffective in detecting emerging ransomware attacks. This work presents “RTrap,” a systematic framework to detect and contain ransomware efficiently and effectively via machine learning-generated deceptive files. Using a data-driven decoy file selection and generation strategy, RTrap plants deceptive decoy files across the directory to lure the ransomware to access it. RTrap also introduced a lightweight decoy watcher to monitor generated decoy files in real time. As the timing of the ransomware attack is not known to the victim in advance, and the ransomware encryption process is speedy, the proposed decoy-watcher executes an automatic/automated response after the detection promptly. The experiment shows that RTrap can detect ransomware with an average 18 file loss per 10311 legitimate user files.}

Firstly, by using the novel pseudo partial derivative, the nonlinear systems are converted into an equivalent data-relationship model. Then, the DoS attacks are described as limited by their frequency and duration, and without any more specific assumptions about the attack structure or strategy. Next, a novel event-triggered MFAC scheme is proposed. By employing the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability performance is analyzed. Furthermore, a compensation algorithm is designed to against the adverse impact brought by the DoS attacks. Finally, simulations including a numerical example and a load frequency control (LFC) example for multi-area power systems are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed schemes.}

Therefore, this paper presents DeepCDR, the first CDR system in which the validation, the prevention rate, and the received visual quality effect of disarming and reconstruction are presented and measured. The effectiveness of the novel DeepCDR against a well-known dataset shows that it disarmed not only the malicious components, but the reconstructed file is also usable and functional. Since CDRs rely on understanding the file format, any CDR solution should handle each supported file type separately due to the vast difference in each format. Hence, this paper focuses on the Rich Text Format file type that is commonly exploited by attackers.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have offered powerful solutions for a wide range of tasks, but the cost to develop such models is nontrivial, which calls for effective model protection. Although black-box distribution can mitigate some threats, model functionality can still be stolen via black-box surrogate attacks. Recent studies have shown that surrogate attacks can be launched in several ways, while the existing defense methods commonly assume attackers with insufficient in-distribution (ID) data and restricted attacking strategies. In this paper, we relax these constraints and assume a practical threat model in which the adversary not only has sufficient ID data and query times but also can adjust the surrogate training data labeled by the victim model. Then, we propose a two-step categorical inference poisoning (CIP) framework, featuring both poisoning for performance degradation (PPD) and poisoning for backdooring (PBD). In the first poisoning step, incoming queries are classified into ID and (out-of-distribution) OOD ones using an energy score (ES) based OOD detector, and the latter are further classified into high ES and low ES ones, which are subsequently passed to a strong and a weak PPD process, respectively. In the second poisoning step, difficult ID queries are detected by a proposed reliability score (RS) measurement and are passed to PBD. In doing so, the first step OOD poisoning leads to substantial performance degradation in surrogate models, the second step ID poisoning further embeds backdoors in them, while both can preserve model fidelity. Extensive experiments confirm that CIP can not only achieve promising performance against state-of-the-art black-box surrogate attacks like KnockoffNets and data-free model extraction (DFME) but also work well against stronger attacks with sufficient ID and deceptive data, better than the existing dynamic adversarial watermarking (DAWN) and deceptive perturbation defense methods.

	abstract = {Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) have blended into a new application scenario to create revolutionary intelligent cities and handle numerous challenges of security, adaptability, and robustness as wireless technology has advanced. Exploiting lightweight cryptosystems is considered one of the main approaches for MWSNs to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to prevent malicious cyberattacks and resource abuses. The Saturnin lightweight cryptosystem, presented at ToSC in 2020, can be applied to protect MWSNs. No literature suggests Saturnin can defend against a ciphertext-only attack, where the attackers are the most susceptible. This study proposes the novel statistical differential fault analysis (SDFA) in this attack scenario with double distinguishers of square Chi-maximum likelihood estimate and Dice-Hamming weight. Following the experiments, it recovered the 256-bit secret key using 656 faults in the fourth-to-last round of Saturnin. Compared to the classic statistical fault analysis (SFA), the novel SDFA can expand fault injections to the deeper round and decrease the faults by half with a reliability of at least 99%. It gives an essential reference for figuring out how secure lightweight cryptosystems in MWSNs are.}

Many recent works are exploring hardware primitives like physically unclonable functions to build keyless cryptographic protocols, with minimal assumptions. The asymmetric nature and non-invertibility property of PUFs are widely exploited to build oblivious transfer protocols that are extended to build bit-commitment schemes. However, these schemes require the physical transfer of the PUF device between the interacting parties. In this work, we introduce a new class of hardware-based primitives called physically related functions that enable hardware circuits to securely communicate with each other over insecure channels. We propose a bit-commitment protocol based on this hardware primitive without needing any physical transfer. Our scheme is statistically hiding and computationally binding, requiring only one round of communication while being practically deployable. We explore the security properties of physically related functions, under which we prove the security of our scheme. We experimentally show that it is impossible to break the security of the scheme with more than negligible probability.}

	abstract = {Vein biometrics is a high security and privacy preserving identification technology that has attracted increasing attention over the last decade. Deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown strong capabilities for robust feature representation, and have achieved, as a result, state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. Inspired by their success, deep learning models have been widely investigated for vein recognition and have shown significant improvement of identification accuracy compared to handcrafted models. Existing deep learning models, however, are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation attacks, where thoughtfully crafted small perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images, degrading, thereby, the efficiency of vein recognition systems. To address this problem, we propose, in this paper, VeinGuard, a novel defense framework to defend deep learning classifiers against adversarial palm-vein image attacks, composed of a local transformer-based GAN and a purifier. VeinGuard comprises two components: a local transformer-based GAN (LTGAN) that learns the distribution of unperturbed vein images and generates high-quality palm-vein images, and a purifier consisting of a trainable residual network and of a pre-trained generator from LTGAN that automatically removes a wide variety of adversarial perturbations. The resulting clean images are fed to vein classifiers for identification, thereby avoiding adversarial attacks. We evaluate VeinGuard on three public vein datasets in terms of white-box attacks, black-box attacks, ablation experiments, and computation time. The experimental results show that VeinGuard allows filtering the perturbations and enables the classifiers to achieve state-of-the-art recognition results for different adversarial attacks.}

	abstract = {Recently, the success of non-additive steganography has demonstrated that asymmetric distortion can remarkably improve security performance compared with symmetric cost functions. However, most of current existing additive steganographic methods are still based on symmetric distortion. In this paper, for the first time we optimize asymmetric distortion for additive steganography and propose an A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) based steganographic framework, called ReLOAD. ReLOAD is composed of an actor and a critic, where the former guides action selection for pixel-wise distortion modulation, and the latter evaluates the performance of modulated distortion. Meanwhile, a reward function that considers embedding effects is proposed to unify the goal of steganography and reinforcement learning, so that the minimization of embedding effects can be achieved by learning secure policy to maximize total rewards. Statistical analysis shows that compared with non-additive steganography, ReLOAD achieves lower change rates and makes embedding traces more consistent with cover image textures. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both hand-crafted feature-based and deep learning-based steganalyzers show that ReLOAD significantly promotes the state-of-the-art security performance of current additive methods and even outperforms non-additive steganography when the modification distribution gets sparser.}

	abstract = {The growing concerns about data privacy in society lead to restrictions on the computer vision research gradually. Several collaboration-based vision learning methods have recently emerged, e.g., federated learning and split learning. These methods protect user data from leaving local devices, and make training performed only by uploading gradients, parameters, or activations, etc. However, there is little research on collaborative learning based on state-of-the-art and large-scaled models, mainly due to the high computation or communication overheads of the latest models. Training these models may be still unrealized for users’ terminals. In this paper, we make a first attempt at the sensitive image pre-training with large-scaled models in the collaborative learning scenario, and propose a new lightweight framework for split learning based on mask, Masked Split Learning (MaskSL). We further ensure its security by differential privacy. Besides, we model the computation and communication overheads of several collaborative learning approaches by deduction to illustrate advantages of our scheme. Finally, we design and conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets, e.g., in face recognition and medical image classification tasks, to demonstrate the performance of MaskSL.}

Existing methods employ different kinds of network structure to extract modality-invariant features. Differently, we propose a novel framework, named Dual-Semantic Consistency Learning Network (DSCNet), which attributes modality discrepancy to channel-level semantic inconsistency. DSCNet optimizes channel consistency from two aspects, fine-grained inter-channel semantics, and comprehensive inter-modality semantics. Furthermore, we propose Joint Semantics Metric Learning to simultaneously optimize the distribution of the channel-and-modality feature embeddings. It jointly exploits the correlation between channel-specific and modality-specific semantics in a fine-grained manner. We conduct a series of experiments on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets, which validates that DSCNet delivers superiority compared with current state-of-the-art methods. On the more challenging SYSU-MM01 dataset, our network can achieve 73.89% Rank-1 accuracy and 69.47% mAP value. Our code is available at https://github.com/bitreidgroup/DSCNet .}

Existing CAN bus anomaly detection mechanisms either can only detect one or two of these attacks, or require numerous CAN messages during predictions, which can hardly realize real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a CAN bus anomaly detection system that can detect all these attacks simultaneously in as short as 3 milliseconds (ms) based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). This work generates directed attributed graphs based on CAN message streams in given message intervals. Node attributes denote data contents in CAN messages while each edge attribute represents the frequency of a typical CAN ID pair in the given interval. Afterwards, a GNN is trained based on generated CAN message graphs. Considering highly imbalanced training data, a two-stage classifier cascade is developed in this paper, which is composed of a one-class classifier for anomaly detection and a multi-class classifier for attack classification. An openmax layer is further introduced to the multi-class classifier to tackle new anomalies from unknown classes. To take advantage of crowdsourcing while protecting user data privacy, we adopt federated learning to train a universal model that covers different driving scenarios and vehicle states. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methodology.}

	abstract = {Scene text recognition (STR) has witnessed tremendous progress in the era of deep learning, but it also raises concerns about privacy infringement as scene texts usually contain valuable or sensitive information. Previous works in privacy protection of scene texts mainly focus on masking out the texts from the image/video. In this work, we learn from the idea of adversarial examples and use minimal pixel perturbation to protect the privacy of text information. Although there are well-established attacking methods on non-sequential vision tasks (e.g., classification), the attack on sequential tasks (e.g., scene text recognition) has not received sufficient attention yet. Moreover, existing works mainly focus on the white-box setting, which requires complete knowledge of the target model (e.g., architecture, parameters, or gradients). These requirements limit the scope of applications for the white-box adversarial attack. Therefore, we propose a novel black-box attacking approach for the STR models, only requiring prior knowledge of the model output. Besides, instead of disturbing most pixels as in existing STR attack methods, our proposed approach only manipulates a few pixels, meaning the perturbation is more inconspicuous. To determine the location and value of the manipulated pixels, we also provide an efficient Adaptive-Discrete Differential Evolution (AD\n2\nE\n) by narrowing down the continuous searching space to a discrete space. It can greatly reduce the queries to the target model. Experiments on several real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Especially, when attacking the commercial STR engine, Baidu-OCR, our method achieves higher attack success rates by a large margin than existing approaches. Our work establishes an important step towards using the black-box adversarial attack with minimal pixels to protect the privacy of text information from being easily obtained by STR models.}

	abstract = {Password-only authentication is one of the most popular secure mechanisms for real-world online applications. But it easily suffers from a practical threat - password leakage, incurred by external and internal attackers. The external attacker may compromise the password file stored on the authentication server, and the insider may deliberately steal the passwords or inadvertently leak the passwords. So far, there are two main techniques to address the leakage: Augmented password-authentication key exchange (aPAKE) against insiders and honeyword technique for external attackers. But none of them can resist both attacks. To fill the gap, we propose the notion of honey PAKE (HPAKE) that allows the authentication server to detect the password leakage and achieve the security beyond the traditional bound of aPAKE. Further, we build an HPAKE construction on the top of the honeyword mechanism, honey encryption, and OPAQUE which is a standardized aPAKE. We formally analyze the security of our design, achieving the insider resistance and the password breach detection. We implement our design and deploy it in the real environment. The experimental results show that our protocol only costs 71.27 ms for one complete run, within 20.67 ms on computation and 50.6 ms on communication. This means our design is secure and practical for real-world applications.}

	abstract = {The hierarchical network is the more effective platform, which provides multiple channels for various worm propagation. Thus, emerging worms can infect vulnerable hosts by scanning strategy and social media. However, the spread of scan-based worm is restrained due to uneven distribution of vulnerable hosts and NAT (Network Address Translation) technique. Meanwhile, topological dependency dictates to topology-based worm only infecting those hosts in social networks. To avoid their respective disadvantages, modern hybrid worm, which combines the above two propagation mechanisms, can implement efficient IP-address scanning by enhanced combination-scanning strategy, and spread more aggressively in social networks using enhanced reinfection mechanism. This paper presents a Hierarchical-Stochastic Propagation model to understand hybrid worm propagation. Inspired by hybrid worm, we design a new vaccine based on the Hierarchical-Measure Immunization strategy. For physical networking layer, we can estimate vulnerable-host distribution to find vulnerable hosts effectively through Maximum Likelihood estimation. For social networking layer, we use a novel propagation centrality measure to discover vital social nodes accurately. The experimental results show that our model can characterize the propagation mechanism of hybrid worms more comprehensively, and greatly outperforms state of the art models in terms of estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, our strategy is more effective to restrain the hybrid worm from spreading in networks.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging framework that enables massive clients (e.g., mobile devices or enterprises) to collaboratively construct a global model without sharing their local data. However, due to the lack of direct access to clients’ data, the global model is vulnerable to be attacked by malicious clients with their poisoned data. Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate the threat of label flipping attacks, but they either require considerable computational overhead, or lack robustness, and some even cause privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose Malicious Clients Detection Federated Learning (MCDFL) to defense against the label flipping attack. It can identify malicious clients by recovering a distribution over a latent feature space to detect the data quality of each client. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, by considering different neural network models and different attack scenarios. The results show that, our solution is robust to detect malicious clients without excessive costs under various conditions, where the proportion of malicious clients is in the range of 5% and 40%.}

	abstract = {Insider threat is destructive and concealable, making addressing it a challenging task in cybersecurity. Most existing methods transform user behavior into sequential information and analyze user behavior while neglecting structural information among users, resulting in high false positives. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Dual-Domain Graph Convolutional Network (referred to as DD-GCN), a graph-based modularized method for high accuracy and adaptive insider threat detection. The central idea is to convert user features and structural information into heterogeneous graphs in the light of various relationships and take user behavior and relationship into account together. To this end, a weighted feature similarity mechanism is applied to balance the feature similarity of users and original linkages among them so as to generate the fused structure. Next, specific graph embeddings are extracted from the original topology structure and fused structure simultaneously, which convert behavior information into high-level representations. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is applied to learn the adaptive importance weights of the user’s features in the corresponding embedding. The combination and difference constraints are proposed to enhance the learned embeddings’ commonality and the ability to capture different information. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly show that our proposed DD-GCN extracts the most correlated information from structural topology and feature information substantially, and achieves improved accuracy with a clear margin.}

	abstract = {The immutability of blockchains is critical for cryptocurrencies, but an imperative need arises for the redaction of on-chain data due to privacy-protecting laws like GPDR. Recently, Ateniese et al. (EuroS&P 2017) proposed an elegant solution to this problem based on chameleon hash functions, followed by many subsequent works. While these works offered a solution to the permissioned blockchain, the approaches were not efficient enough for the permissionless setting, in terms of either security (which may cause inconsistent historical transactions) or performance (only up to a few hundred nodes). In this paper, we investigate this problem and present Wolverine, a redactable permissionless blockchain. First, we present a formal redactable blockchain model, carefully considering transaction consistency. Next, towards a practical scheme, we introduce the novel concept of non-interactive chameleon hash (NITCH). NITCHs dynamically distribute a trapdoor key among a group and each party in the group can compute its partial share without communicating with others. Anyone who possesses enough shares can then find a valid hash collision. To prevent the static group from being compromised after a sufficiently long time, we provide a generic transform from NITCHs to decentralized random beacons (DRBs) and design a committee evolution protocol based on DRBs that refresh the group after every fixed interval of time. Based on NITCH and the committee evolution protocol, we construct Wolverine which offers important features such as scalability, transaction consistency, and public accountability. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of Wolverine by giving a proof-of-concept implementation based on Bitcoin in Golang.}

	abstract = {Training a Deep Learning (DL) model requires proprietary data and computing-intensive resources. To recoup their training costs, a model provider can monetize DL models through Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). Generally, the model is deployed at the cloud, while providing a publicly accessible Application Programming Interface (API) for paid queries to obtain benefits. However, model stealing attacks have posed security threats to this model monetizing scheme as they steal the model without paying for future extensive queries. Specifically, an adversary queries a targeted model to obtain input-output pairs and thus infer the model’s internal working mechanism by reverse-engineering a substitute model, which has deprived model owner’s business advantage and leaked the privacy of the model. In this work, we observe that the confidence vector or the top-1 confidence returned from the model under attack (MUA) varies in a relative large degree given different queried inputs. Therefore, rich internal information of the MUA is leaked to the attacker that facilities her reconstruction of a substitute model. We thus propose to leverage adversarial confidence perturbation to hide such varied confidence distribution given different queries, consequentially against model stealing attacks (dubbed as APMSA). In other words, the confidence vectors returned now is similar for queries from a specific category, considerably reducing information leakage of the MUA. To achieve this objective, through automated optimization, we constructively add delicate noise into per input query to make its confidence close to the decision boundary of the MUA. Generally, this process is achieved in a similar means of crafting adversarial examples but with a distinction that the hard label is preserved to be the same as the queried input. This retains the inference utility (i.e., without sacrificing the inference accuracy) for normal users but bounded the leaked confidence information to the attacker in a small constrained area (i.e., close to decision boundary). The later renders greatly deteriorated accuracy of the attacker’s substitute model. As the APMSA serves as a plug-in front-end and requires no change to the MUA, it is thus generic and easy to deploy. The high efficacy of APMSA is validated through experiments on datasets of CIFAR10 and GTSRB. Given a MUA model of ResNet-18 on the CIFAR10, our defense can degrade the accuracy of the stolen model by up to 15% (rendering the stolen model useless to a large extent) with 0% accuracy drop for normal user’s hard-label inference request.}

In the first problem of Private and Secure Matrix Multiplication (PSMM) from colluding servers, the master intends to compute the product of its confidential matrix\nA\nwith a target matrix stored on the servers, without revealing any information about\nA\nand the index of target matrix to some colluding servers. In the second problem of Fully Private Matrix Multiplication (FPMM) from colluding servers, the matrix\nA\nis also selected from another family of public matrices stored at the servers in MDS form. In this case, the indices of the two target matrices should both be kept private from colluding servers. We develop novel strategies for the two PSMM and FPMM problems, which simultaneously guarantee information-theoretic data/index privacy and computation correctness. We compare the proposed PSMM strategy with a previous PSMM strategy with a weaker privacy guarantee (non-colluding servers), and demonstrate substantial improvements over the previous strategy in terms of communication and computation overheads. Moreover, compared with a baseline FPMM strategy that uses the idea of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to directly retrieve the desired matrix multiplication, the proposed FPMM strategy significantly reduces storage overhead, but slightly incurs large communication and computation overheads.}

	abstract = {DeepFake detection aims to differentiate falsified faces from real ones. Most approaches formulate it as a binary classification problem by solely mining the local artifacts and inconsistencies of face forgery, which neglect the relation across local regions. Although several recent works explore local relation learning for DeepFake detection, they overlook the propagation of relational information and lead to limited performance gains. To address these issues, this paper provides a new perspective by formulating DeepFake detection as a graph classification problem, in which each facial region corresponds to a vertex. But relational information with large redundancy hinders the expressiveness of graphs. Inspired by the success of masked modeling, we propose Masked Relation Learning which decreases the redundancy to learn informative relational features. Specifically, a spatiotemporal attention module is exploited to learn the attention features of multiple facial regions. A relation learning module masks partial correlations between regions to reduce redundancy and then propagates the relational information across regions to capture the irregularity from a global view of the graph. We empirically discover that a moderate masking rate (e.g., 50%) brings the best performance gain. Experiments verify the effectiveness of Masked Relation Learning and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state of the art by 2% AUC on the cross-dataset DeepFake video detection.

	abstract = {The subject of attack detection for industrial cyber-physical systems (IPCSs) is covered in this paper, which addresses threats from transient covert attacks (TCAs), also referred to as the second version of replay attacks with a specific frequency and short duration. A comprehensive model of the TCAs is built using the active instant and period of the attacks, as well as the dynamics of a virtual system to replicate IPCS function and produce attack signals. Though watermarking-based detection algorithms have been shown to be effective in detecting TCAs, the induced system performance loss is too significant, and as such, our primary goal is to minimize system performance degradation while maintaining the detection rate. Because the active periods of TCAs are substantially shorter than their sleep ones, or even because they are practically always silent, it makes sense that reducing superfluous watermarking will facilitate system performance. So, using an “event-triggered” strategy, a unique recursive watermarking-based detection algorithm is proposed. Here, the trigger modes of watermarking are divided into three types: forced, high probability, and low probability. The design principles are proven via algorithms and criteria, and a theoretical analysis of the detection rate and the system performance loss is also supplied. The advantages of the suggested algorithms are finally demonstrated by numerical simulations of a quadruple-water-tank system and experiments with a permanent magnet synchronous motor on the dSpace platform.}

Fast and accurate minutiae detection from fingerprint images is the key to advance fingerprint matching algorithms for large-scale applications. However, currently available fingerprint minutiae extraction methods are not accurate and fast enough to support such large-scale applications. This paper proposes a new method that uses a lightweight pixelwise local dilated neural network to extract local features and a patch-wise global neural network to recover the global features. It consolidates the local and global fingerprint features to generate a full-size minutiae location map, and then accurately localizes the minutiae positions by using a recursive connected components algorithm. We design a new loss function to accurately detect minutia orientation and incorporate a dynamic end-to-end loss to provide effective supervision in learning discriminant features. It is due to the proposed design and loss function that can enable higher accuracy with significantly less computations. We present reproducible experimental results from five publicly available contact-based and contactless databases that indicate significant improvement in the minutiae detection accuracy, which also leads to enhanced fingerprint matching accuracy. Since the minutiae represent key points in the fingerprint images, the proposed end-to-end minutiae detection method also has a potential to be employed in many other key points detection tasks.}

	abstract = {To defend against eavesdropping and spoofing attacks, the physical layer authentication (PLA) techniques utilize the unique attributes of channel or device for identifying attackers. Among these techniques, the PLA schemes based on channel phase responses use the secret key driven channel phase to authenticate the legitimate user, which have a better performance than the channel amplitude based schemes. However, the prior phase-based schemes only consider the perfect channel correlation coefficient between the two successive timeslots, which differs from the real scenarios. Meanwhile, the closed-form expressions of the theoretical analysis results are not comprehensive in the prior schemes, which are also not tight especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. In this paper, we propose a PLA scheme based on the channel phase response, aiming to offset the performance loss introduced by the channel correlation coefficient. Moreover, we derive the closed-form expressions of the theoretical analysis results, such as the mean value, the variance and the probability density functions (PDFs), which can be utilized to provide the closed-form threshold for making decision instead of a great ideal of testing. Then, the security analysis is provided to verify the resistance of the proposed scheme under the attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmarks and the proposed theoretical results match well with the simulated results even under low SNR regions.}

Our results shed light on real-world attacks on deployed machine learning. On the organizational level, while we find no predictors for threat exposure in our sample, the amount of implement defenses depends on exposure to threats or expected likelihood to become a target. We also provide a detailed analysis of practitioners’ replies on the relevance of individual machine learning attacks, unveiling complex concerns like unreliable decision making, business information leakage, and bias introduction into models. Finally, we find that on the individual level, prior knowledge about machine learning security influences threat perception.

However, these evaluation methods are not helpful for the PUF design, because the relationship between the PUF structure and the anti-modeling-attack capability is not established explicitly. This work proposes a security evaluation method of PUF based on the mimic attack and the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) theory. The anti-modeling-attack capability of PUF is measured by the corresponding area enclosed by the evaluation curve. Twenty representative types of PUFs with different sizes are evaluated by the proposed method. It shows that the proposed method is effective, because the evaluation results are consistent with the difficulties of modeling attacks for the corresponding PUFs in the design practices. And the evaluation results are able to assist the PUF design.}

	abstract = {As an emerging biometric technology, multi-spectral palmprint recognition has attracted increasing attention in security due to its high accuracy and ease of use. Compared to single spectral case, multi-spectral palmprint model is more susceptible to the attack of adversarial examples. However, the previous adversarial example attack approaches cannot generate the most aggressive adversarial examples for multi-spectral palmprint recognition. In addition, most of them are dependent on the explicit architecture or need time-consuming queries about the network to be attacked, which significantly limits their application in the field of security. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we proposed the multi-spectral palmprints joint attack and defense framework based on multi-view adversarial examples learning. First, we respectively capture the multi-view deep common feature space for the different spectra and the discriminative feature space across the different subjects. Second, we introduce perturbation in the deep common space to achieve adversarial multi-spectral palmprints with gradient propagation. In addition, we pursue the manifold of the difference space and use it to suppress the discriminability of the recognition model with adversarial region theory. Finally, the generated adversarial examples are fed into the training model to enhance the robustness of the recognition algorithm. The experimental results on multi-spectral palmprint dataset demonstrate that the proposed multi-view joint attack approach is superior to the state-of-the-art adversarial example attack methods in attack accuracy and transferability. Moreover, the defense strategy with the adversarial examples by our method can significantly promote the robustness of multi-spectral palmprint recognition methods.}

In this paper we propose a novel approach to achieve privacy-preserving statistical analysis on an encrypted database. The main idea of this work is to construct a privacy-preserving calculator to calculate attributes’ count values for later statistical analysis. To authenticate these encrypted count values, we adopt an authenticable additive homomorphic encryption scheme to construct the calculator. We formalize the notion of an authenticable privacy-preserving calculator that has properties of broadcasting and additive homomorphism. Further, we propose a cryptosystem based on binary vectors to achieve complex logic expressions for statistical analysis on encrypted data. With the aid of the proposed cryptographic calculator, we design several protocols for statistical analysis including conjunctive, disjunctive and complex logic expressions to achieve more complicated statistical functionalities. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is feasible and practical.}

	abstract = {Currently, it is ever more common to access online services for activities which formerly required physical attendance. From banking operations to visa applications, a significant number of processes have been digitised, especially since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring remote biometric authentication of the user. On the downside, some subjects intend to interfere with the normal operation of remote systems for personal profit by using fake identity documents, such as passports and ID cards. Deep learning solutions to detect such frauds have been presented in the literature. However, due to privacy concerns and the sensitive nature of personal identity documents, developing a dataset with the necessary number of examples for training deep neural networks is challenging. This work explores three methods for synthetically generating ID card images to increase the amount of data while training fraud-detection networks. These methods include computer vision algorithms and Generative Adversarial Networks. Our results indicate that databases can be supplemented with synthetic images without any loss in performance for the print/scan Presentation Attack Instrument Species (PAIS) and a loss in performance of 1% for the screen capture PAIS.}

	abstract = {The existing solutions related to local differential privacy (LDP) in multi-layer networks for edge computing scenarios present several limitations in both key-value data heavy hitter identification and related frequency and mean estimation tasks. First, existing LDP approaches cannot effectively use edge nodes to improve their utility/performance. Secondly, there are many network transmission tasks in edge computing, which have relatively high requirements for communication and storage costs. Furthermore, the traditional privacy budget allocation cannot attain the best utilization. To solve the above problems, we propose MLPKV, a local differential multi-layer private key-value data collection scheme for edge computing, structured into three phases: dimensional reduction, padding-length estimation, and estimation. An improved EC-OLH algorithm is used to offload the computing efforts related to aggregation and estimation to edge nodes for achieving greater efficiency. In the dimensional reduction phase, a candidate set is generated to prune the domain of original data, which improves the estimation. In addition, our method groups users for completing the tasks in each phase to avoid additional errors caused by dividing the privacy budget, and proposes a new user division with an optimal grouping ratio. Finally, the proposed method was implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype system. We compare MLPKV with baseline methods such as PrivKV and PCKV. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves better utility for heavy hitter identification, frequency, and mean estimations than other state-of-the-art mechanisms. For small data sets, our approach also provides high-accuracy estimation with a low privacy budget.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been widely recognized as an enabler of the global trend of digital transformation. With the increasing adoption of data-hungry machine learning algorithms, personal data privacy has emerged as one of the key concerns that could hinder the success of digital transformation. As such, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) has received much attention of the machine learning community, from academic researchers to industry practitioners to government regulators. However, organizations are faced with the dilemma that, on the one hand, they are encouraged to share data to enhance ML performance, but on the other hand, they could potentially be breaching the relevant data privacy regulations. Practical PPML typically allows multiple participants to individually train their ML models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a privacy-preserving manner, e.g., based on multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption. Nevertheless, in most important applications of large-scale PPML, e.g., by aggregating clients’ gradients to update a global model for federated learning, such as consumer behavior modeling of mobile application services, some participants are inevitably resource-constrained mobile devices, which may drop out of the PPML system due to their mobility nature (Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, the resilience of privacy-preserving aggregation has become an important problem to be tackled because of its real-world application potential and impacts. In this paper, we propose a scalable privacy-preserving aggregation scheme that can tolerate dropout by participants at any time, and is secure against both semi-honest and active malicious adversaries by setting proper system parameters. By replacing communication-intensive building blocks with a seed homomorphic pseudo-random generator, and relying on the additive homomorphic property of Shamir secret sharing scheme, our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by up to 6.37\\times in runtime and provides a stronger dropout-resilience. The simplicity of our scheme makes it attractive both for implementation and for further improvements.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL), emerging as a distributed machine learning, is a popular paradigm that allows multiple users to collaboratively train an intermediate model by exchanging local models without the training data leaving each user’s domain. However, FL still suffer from privacy risk such as leaking private information from users’ uploaded local models. To address the privacy concern, several approaches have been proposed to achieve privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) based on differential privacy (DP), multi-party computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE) and functional encryption (FE). Compared with DP, MPC and HE, approaches based on FE are more advantageous and thus become the focus of this work. Moreover, all existing PPFL schemes via FE employ a multi-user extension of FE for a specific function, i.e., multi-input FE (MIFE). In this paper, we point out that existing FE-based PPFL schemes have faced with several security issues due to the misuse of MIFE. After reconsidering the security requirements of PPFL, we propose new goals of designing PPFL using FE. To achieve our goals, we propose a new FE called dual-mode decentralized multi-client FE (2DMCFE) and give a concreate construction for 2DMCFE. With 2DMCFE, we propose a new framework of PPFL where we establish a fresh 2DMCFE instance for each subset of users. Security proof shows the strong security of our framework under the semi-honest security setting. Furthermore, experiments conducted on real dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable model accuracy and training efficiency to the basic FE-based scheme while providing stronger security guarantee.}

	abstract = {Dynamic hand gesture is an emerging and promising biometric trait. It contains both physiological and behavioral characteristics, which on the one hand can theoretically make authentication systems more accurate and more secure, and on the other hand can increase the difficulty of model design because it is essentially a fine-grained video understanding task. For authentication systems, equal error rate (EER) and real-time performance are two vital metrics. Current video understanding-based hand gesture authentication methods mainly focus on lowering the EER while neglecting to reduce the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a 2D CNN-based depthwise temporal non-local network (DwTNL-Net) that can take into account both EER and running efficiency. To enable the DwTNL-Net with spatiotemporal information processing capability, we design a temporal sharpening (TS) module and a DwTNL module for short- and long-term identity feature modeling, respectively. The TS module can assist the backbone in local behavioral characteristic understanding and can simultaneously reduce redundant information and highlight behavioral cues while retaining sufficient physiological characteristics. In contrast, the DwTNL module focuses on summarizing global information and discovering stable patterns, which are finally used for local information enhancement. The complementary combination of our TS and DwTNL modules makes DwTNL-Net achieve substantial performance improvements. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-DHGA dataset and sufficient statistical analyses fully demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our DwTNL-Net.

	abstract = {While preserving the privacy of federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP) inevitably degrades the utility (i.e., accuracy) of FL due to model perturbations caused by DP noise added to model updates. Existing studies have considered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and overlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse effects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with a time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the capability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a geometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the dependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the\n(ϵ,δ)\n-DP requirement. We derive an online refinement of the series to prevent FL from premature convergence resulting from excessive perturbation noise. Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for the loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the new DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is obtained, balancing the learning and privacy. Extensive experiments are conducted using MLP, supporting vector machine, and convolutional neural network models on four public datasets. The contribution of the new DP mechanism to the convergence and accuracy of privacy-preserving FL is corroborated, compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise mechanism with a persistent noise amplitude.}

	abstract = {The 5G mobile communication network provides seamless communication between users and service providers and promises to achieve several stringent requirements, such as seamless mobility and massive connectivity. Although 5G can offer numerous benefits, security and privacy issues must be addressed. For example, the inclusion of small cell networks (SCN) into 5G brings the network closer to the connected users, providing a better quality of services (QoS), resulting in a significant increase in the number of Handover procedures (HO), which will affect the security, latency and efficiency of the network. It is then crucial to design a scheme that supports seamless handovers through a secure authentication process. With this aim, we propose a secure region-based handover scheme in this article that supports seamless connectivity for SCNs in 5G. Our proposed scheme is based on asymmetric-key-based authenticated key exchange and handover protocols that preserve user privacy and network security while providing a seamless region-based handover mechanism and effective membership revocation management. In this context, we introduce three privacy-preserving protocols, i.e., an initial authentication protocol, an intra-region handover protocol and an inter-region handover protocol, for dealing with three communication scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the privacy and security in both the intra-region and inter-region handover scenarios in 5G communication with practical membership revocation management support. Detailed security and performance analysis of our proposed scheme is presented to show that it is resilient against many security threats, is cost-effective and provides an efficient solution for 5G-enabled mobile communication.}

	abstract = {Recently, finger vein sensors have been embedded in all kinds of electronic devices for personal identification, such as intelligent door locks and attendance machines. The embedded sensors are generally small, thus capturing only part of the finger vein. However, prior studies have focused on near-full finger vein recognition, without considering the partial finger vein image caused by the small imaging window of the finger vein sensor. This paper aims to study personal identification based on partial finger vein images, known as small-area finger vein recognition. The effect of the small-area finger vein on recognition performance is first analyzed by cutting out the local part from the near-full finger vein image to model a small-area finger vein image. Second, a small-area finger vein database is built using a commercial finger vein imaging device, in which the vein pattern from approximately one-third of one adult finger is captured. To explore more discriminative information from small-area finger vein images, we propose a locality-constrained consistent dictionary learning (LCDL) method to fuse multiple features for small-area finger vein recognition. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the self-built small-area finger vein database and four synthetic small-area finger vein databases. Experimental results show the promising recognition performance of the proposed method.}

In this paper, the effectiveness of a total of seven disruption strategies for two real Mafia networks is investigated adopting SNA tools. Three interventions targeting actors with a high level of social capital and three interventions targeting those with a high human capital are put to the test and compared between each other and with random node removal. Similar tests on artificial model networks have also been carried out. Simulations show that actor removal based on social capital proves to be the most effective strategy, by leading to the total disruption of the criminal network in the least number of steps. The removal of a specific figure of a Mafia family such as the Caporegime seems also promising in the network disruption.}

	abstract = {The security of secret keys for blockchain-based applications is increasingly important, partly because the theft of secret keys will render a significant financial loss. To guarantee the security of secret keys, many multi-party signature protocols have been proposed. However, few of them are designed for EdDSA-based blockchain that is developing in growth. The folklore and the NIST document for standardizing threshold schemes believe that a distributed hash evaluation is required to design multi-party EdDSA protocols, which leads to a relatively large overhead. In this paper, we present two practical multi-party EdDSA protocols for semi-honest and malicious settings. Our protocols eliminate the distributed hashing by securely maintaining a global state, which is feasible for EdDSA-based blockchain. Furthermore, we extend the malicious protocol to resist DoS attacks by identifying corrupted parties in case of execution aborts. We implemented our EdDSA protocols for different parties using Alibaba cloud servers with all instances of type ecs.t5-c1m2.large. Our protocol in the malicious setting takes 1.51-15.3 ms between 2 parties and 5 parties, and are two orders of magnitude faster than the recent threshold EdDSA protocol. These properties (efficient, identifiable abort, high compatibility) make the two protocols ideal for threshold wallets for EdDSA-based cryptocurrency.}

	abstract = {Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a VPN technology that connects remote client sites with provider networks in a transparent manner. Session key-based HIPLS (S-HIPLS) is a VPLS architecture based on the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) that provides a secure VPLS architecture using a Key Distribution Center (KDC) to implement security mechanisms such as authentication, encryption etc. It exhibits limited scalability though. Using multiple distributed KDCs would offer numerous advantages including reduced workload per KDC, distributed key storage, and improved scalability, while simultaneously eliminating the single point of failure of S-HIPLS. It would also come with the need for optimally placing KDCs in the provider network. In this work, we formulate the KDC placement (KDCP) problem for a secure VPLS network as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. The latter is NP-hard, thereby suggesting a high computational cost for obtaining exact solutions especially for large deployments. Therefore, we motivate the use of a primal-dual algorithm to efficiently produce near-optimal solutions. Extensive evaluations on large-scale network topologies, such as the random Internet graph, demonstrate our method’s time-efficiency as well as its improved scalability and usefulness compared to both HIPLS and S-HIPLS.}

	abstract = {As an ownership verification technique for deep neural networks, the white-box neural network watermark is being challenged by the functionality equivalence attack. By leveraging the structural symmetry within a deep neural network and manipulating the parameters accordingly, an adversary can invalidate almost all white-box watermarks without affecting the network’s performance. This paper introduces the linear functionality equivalence attack, which can adapt to different network architectures without requiring knowledge of either the watermark or data. We also propose NeuronMap, a framework that can efficiently neutralize linear functionality equivalence attacks and can be easily combined with existing white-box watermarks to enhance their robustness. Experiments conducted on several deep neural networks and state-of-the-art white-box watermarking schemes have demonstrated not only the destructive power of linear functionality equivalence attacks but also the defense capability of NeuronMap. Our result shows that the threat of basic linear functionality equivalence attacks against deep neural network watermarks can be effectively solved using NeuronMap.}

Recent works have shown that the value of the data of one of the providers is dependent on the similarity with the data owned by the other provider. It would thus be beneficial if the two providers can calculate the similarity of their data, while keeping the actual data private. In this work, we devise multiparty computation-protocols to compute similarity of two data sets based on correlation, while offering controllable privacy guarantees. We consider a simple model with two participating providers and develop methods to compute exact and approximate correlation, respectively, with controlled information leakage. Both protocols have computational and communication complexities that are linear in the number of data samples. We also provide general bounds on the maximal error in the approximation case, and analyse the resulting errors for practical parameter choices.}

	abstract = {Aiming to match object identities across different modalities of images, the challenging task namely cross-modality object re-identification (NIR-VIS object Re-ID), has attracted increasing attention due to its wide application in low-light scenes. However, dramatic modality-dependent and camera-related discrepancies between Near-InfraRed-spectrum (NIR) and VISible-spectrum (VIS) images lead to a considerable intra-class gap in feature space. To address the problem, we propose a novel Modality and Camera factors Bi-Disentanglement (MCBD) model to learn modality-independent and camera-unrelated features for NIR-VIS object Re-ID. Our model consists of three key modules, including Confused Modality Generation (CMG), Modality-independent Information Distillation (MID), and Cameras Factor Disentanglement (CFD). Firstly, aiming at aligning image style between NIR and VIS data, the CMG utilizes a designed channel-interactive generator to generate confused modality images which preserves the structure information of original images. Besides, CMG is trained with confused adversarial learning which bridges the modality gap at the image level. Nevertheless, training the model with the confused modality images discards identity-related information such as color and contrast, which is not conducive to the extraction of distinctive features. To solve this problem, the MID is presented to distill out modality-independent information by feeding the original images to the model and reconstructing corresponding NIR and VIS modalities features to the confused modality images. Finally, due to the complexity of camera-related information in images, identity representation inevitably contains camera-related elements such as background and perspective information, which may interfere the matching process. To address this issue, the CFD is introduced to disentangle camera-related factors by the designed three-streams network and two factor decoupling losses, i.e., Camera-Camera Factor loss (CCF) and Identity-Camera Factor (ICF) loss. Comprehensive experiments are carried out on two cross-modality pedestrian Re-ID datasets and a cross-modality vehicle Re-ID dataset to demonstrate that the MCBD is effective in cross-modality object Re-ID task.}

Unfortunately, public media are prone to adversaries, and such devices must protect the privacy and confidentiality of users’ data. Although authentication and key agreement protocols achieve the goal, they may suffer from hidden vulnerabilities; detecting them requires solid mathematical knowledge. Informal methods can discover protocol vulnerabilities, but most of them are limited to analyzing a specific protocol. Therefore, it is essential to provide a way for analyzing arbitrary ones. This paper proposes several algorithms to perform informal analyzes in\nO(\nn\n3\n×log(n))\n. Also, the article offers some ideas for optimizing these algorithms to achieve\nO(\nn\n2\n)\n, where\nn\nis the number of involved parameters in the protocol. Additionally, this paper introduces three graphical representations for vulnerability detection and examines their strengths and weaknesses. The compact version of such an expression has a better performance compared to the others. This method enables students with a weak mathematical background to analyze complex protocols on a piece of paper. The article explores four protocols published in recent years and describes how adversaries can obtain session keys in different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Recently, deepfakes have raised severe concerns about the authenticity of online media. Prior works for deepfake detection have made many efforts to capture the intra-modal artifacts. However, deepfake videos in real-world scenarios often consist of a combination of audio and visual. In this paper, we propose an Audio-Visual Joint Learning for Detecting Deepfake (AVoiD-DF), which exploits audio-visual inconsistency for multi-modal forgery detection. Specifically, AVoiD-DF begins by embedding temporal-spatial information in Temporal-Spatial Encoder. A Multi-Modal Joint-Decoder is then designed to fuse multi-modal features and jointly learn inherent relationships. Afterward, a Cross-Modal Classifier is devised to detect manipulation with inter-modal and intra-modal disharmony. Since existing datasets for deepfake detection mainly focus on one modality and only cover a few forgery methods, we build a novel benchmark DefakeAVMiT for multi-modal deepfake detection. DefakeAVMiT contains sufficient visuals with corresponding audios, where any one of the modalities may be maliciously modified by multiple deepfake methods. The experimental results on DefakeAVMiT, FakeAVCeleb, and DFDC demonstrate that the AVoiD-DF outperforms many state-of-the-arts in deepfake detection. Our proposed method also yields superior generalization on various forgery techniques.}

	abstract = {The boom of cloud computing has stimulated the prevalence of outsourced query services, and privacy concerns further motivate extensive studies on privacy-preserving queries in the cloud. Graph similarity query is one critical query type, in which the similarity between two graphs is usually measured by graph edit distance (GED). Although many schemes have been proposed for GED computation/graph similarity query, they do not consider data privacy and are not applicable to the cloud computing scenario. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the first efficient and privacy-preserving graph similarity query (PGSim) scheme in the filter and verification framework. Specifically, we first identify the pivot filter property of GED and use the property to design a pivot R-tree based filter algorithm, which can efficiently retrieve candidate graphs for graph similarity query. Then, we design a vertex mapping (VM) tree to index all vertex mappings between two graphs and develop a GED query verification algorithm to verify candidate graphs. After that, we design a suite of private algorithms based on a symmetric homomorphic encryption scheme and apply them to propose a pivot R-tree based filter predicate encryption (PRFilter) scheme and a private GED query verification (PGQVerify) algorithm. Based on the PRFilter scheme and the PGQVerify algorithm, we propose our PGSim scheme. Rigorous security analysis shows that our scheme is selectively secure. Performance evaluation also demonstrates the high efficiency of our scheme.}

The SD-WAN is considered as a technology that has a potential to revolutionize the WAN service usage by utilizing the SDN philosophy. Attacks within SD-WAN can affect the network and block the entire services. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based anomalous traffic detection framework named OADSD over SD-WAN that can achieve task independently and has the ability of adapting to the environment. The OADSD adopts Distributed Dynamic Feature Extraction (DDFE) to extract representative features directly from the raw traffic, and proposes the On-demand Evolving Isolation Forest (OEIF) to make the system adapt to an environment. We provide a theoretical analysis of the performance of the OADSD. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the OADSD with real world public datasets as well as a small real testbed. Our experiments under real world public datasets show that, the OADSD can accurately detect various kinds of attacks with a high performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art systems, the OADSD can achieve up to 60% accuracy improvement.}

	abstract = {With the development of deep learning technology, the facial manipulation system has become powerful and easy to use. Such systems can modify the attributes of the given facial images, such as hair color, gender, and age. Malicious applications of such systems pose a serious threat to individuals’ privacy and reputation. Existing studies have proposed various approaches to protect images against facial manipulations. Passive defense methods aim to detect whether the face is real or fake, which works for posterior forensics but can not prevent malicious manipulation. Initiative defense methods protect images upfront by injecting adversarial perturbations into images to disrupt facial manipulation systems but can not identify whether the image is fake. To address the limitation of existing methods, we propose a novel two-tier protection method named Information-containing Adversarial Perturbation (IAP), which provides more comprehensive protection for facial images. We use an encoder to map a facial image and its identity message to a cross-model adversarial example which can disrupt multiple facial manipulation systems to achieve initiative protection. Recovering the message in adversarial examples with a decoder serves passive protection, contributing to provenance tracking and fake image detection. We introduce a feature-level correlation measurement that is more suitable to measure the difference between the facial images than the commonly used mean squared error. Moreover, we propose a spectral diffusion method to spread messages to different frequency channels, thereby improving the robustness of the message against facial manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed IAP can recover the messages from the adversarial examples with high average accuracy and effectively disrupt the facial manipulation systems.}

	abstract = {Bottleneck problems are an important class of optimization problems that have recently gained increasing attention in the domain of machine learning and information theory. They are widely used in generative models, fair machine learning algorithms, design of privacy-assuring mechanisms, and appear as information-theoretic performance bounds in various multi-user communication problems. In this work, we propose a general family of optimization problems, termed as complexity-leakage-utility bottleneck (CLUB) model, which (i) provides a unified theoretical framework that generalizes most of the state-of-the-art literature for the information-theoretic privacy models, (ii) establishes a new interpretation of the popular generative and discriminative models, (iii) constructs new insights for the generative compression models, and (iv) can be used to obtain fair generative models. We first formulate the CLUB model as a complexity-constrained privacy-utility optimization problem. We then connect it with the closely related bottleneck problems, namely information bottleneck (IB), privacy funnel (PF), deterministic IB (DIB), conditional entropy bottleneck (CEB), and conditional PF (CPF). We show that the CLUB model generalizes all these problems as well as most other information-theoretic privacy models. Then, we construct the deep variational CLUB (DVCLUB) models by employing neural networks to parameterize variational approximations of the associated information quantities. Building upon these information quantities, we present unified objectives of the supervised and unsupervised DVCLUB models. Leveraging the DVCLUB model in an unsupervised setup, we then connect it with state-of-the-art generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), Wasserstein auto-encoder (WAE), and adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) models through the optimal transport (OT) problem. We then show that the DVCLUB model can also be used in fair representation learning problems, where the goal is to mitigate the undesired bias during the training phase of a machine learning model. We conduct extensive quantitative experiments on colored-MNIST and CelebA datasets.}

	abstract = {The conventional device authentication of wireless networks usually relies on a security server and centralized process, leading to long latency and risk of single-point of failure. While these challenges might be mitigated by collaborative authentication schemes, their performance remains limited by the rigidity of data collection and aggregated result. They also tend to ignore attacker localization in the collaborative authentication process. To overcome these challenges, a novel collaborative authentication scheme is proposed, where multiple edge devices act as cooperative peers to assist the service provider in distributively authenticating its users by estimating their received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and mobility trajectory (TRA). More explicitly, a distributed learning-based collaborative authentication algorithm is conceived, where the cooperative peers update their authentication models locally, thus the network congestion and response time remain low. Moreover, a situation-aware secure group update algorithm is proposed for autonomously refreshing the set of cooperative peers in the dynamic environment. We also develop an algorithm for localizing a malicious user by the cooperative peers once it is identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is eminently suitable for both indoor and outdoor communication scenarios, and outperforms some existing benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Model-based gait recognition methods usually adopt the pedestrian walking postures to identify human beings. However, existing methods did not explicitly resolve the large intra-class variance of human pose due to changes in camera view. In this paper, we propose a lower-upper generative adversarial network (LUGAN) to generate multi-view pose sequences for each single-view sample to reduce the cross-view variance. Based on the prior of camera imaging, we prove that the spatial coordinates between cross-view poses satisfy a linear transformation of a full-rank matrix. Hence, LUGAN employs the adversarial training to learn full-rank transformation matrices from the source pose and target views to obtain the target pose sequences. The generator of LUGAN is composed of graph convolutional (GCN) layers, fully connected (FC) layers and two-branch convolutional (CNN) layers: GCN layers and FC layers encode the source pose sequence and target view, then CNN layers take as input the encoded features to learn a lower triangular matrix and an upper one, finally the transformation matrix is formulated by multiplying the lower and upper triangular matrices. For the purpose of adversarial training, we develop a conditional discriminator that distinguishes whether the pose sequence is true or generated. Furthermore, to facilitate the high-level correlation learning, we propose a plug-and-play module, named multi-scale hypergraph convolution (HGC), to replace the spatial graph convolutional layer in baseline, which can simultaneously model the joint-level, part-level and body-level correlations. Extensive experiments on three large gait recognition datasets (i.e., CASIA-B, OUMVLP-Pose and NLPR) demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline model by a large margin.}

	abstract = {In response to the threat of adversarial examples, adversarial training provides an attractive option for improving robustness by training models on online-augmented adversarial examples. However, most existing adversarial training methods focus on improving the model’s robust accuracy by strengthening the adversarial examples but neglecting the increasing shift between natural data and adversarial examples, leading to a decrease in natural accuracy. To maintain the trade-off between natural and robust accuracy, we alleviate the shift from the perspective of feature adaption and propose a Feature Adaptive Adversarial Training (FAAT) optimizing the class-conditional feature adaption across natural data and adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose to incorporate a class-conditional discriminator to encourage the features to become (1) class-discriminative and (2) invariant to the change of adversarial attacks. The novel FAAT framework enables the trade-off between natural and robust accuracy by generating features with similar distribution across natural and adversarial data within the same class and achieves higher overall robustness benefiting from the class-discriminative feature characteristics. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that FAAT produces more discriminative features and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The queries we perform, the searches we make, and the websites we visit — this sensitive data is collected at scale by companies as part of the services they provide. Query obfuscation, intertwining the user queries with artificial queries, has been proposed as a solution to protect the privacy of individuals on the web. We here present a formal model and formulate through attack models three privacy requirements for obfuscators: 1) indistinguishability, that the user query should be hard to identify; 2) coverage, that its topic should be hard to identify; and 3) imprecision, that the query should still be hard to identify for an attacker with additional auxiliary information. The latter is needed to make the former two guarantees “future-proof”. Using our framework, we derive two important results for obfuscators. First, we show that indistinguishability imposes strong bounds on the coverage and imprecision achievable by an obfuscator. Second, we prove an important tradeoff between coverage and imprecision, which inherently limits the strength and robustness of the privacy guarantees that an obfuscator can provide. We then introduce a family of obfuscators with provable indistinguishability guarantees, which we call\nk−\nball obfuscators, and show, for a range of parameter values, the achievable coverage and imprecision. We show empirically that our theoretical tradeoff holds, and that its bound is not tight in practice: even in a simple idealized setting, there is a significant gap between practical coverage and imprecision guarantees, and the optimal bounds. While obfuscators have proven popular with the general public, all obfuscators currently available provide ad-hoc guarantees, and have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks, putting the data of users at risk. We hope this work to be a first step towards a robust evaluation of the properties of query obfuscators and the development of principled obfuscators.}

	abstract = {This study presents a novel approach for physical layer authentication based on channel polarization response (CPR). CPR is sensitive to variation in the physical properties of scatterers, and the CPR difference between various channels is higher than the channel frequency response (CFR) under rich scattering scenarios. Additionally, the estimation of CPR is continuous, the authentication interval can be adjusted according to the channel coherence time, then the proposed scheme can be applied to any rich scattering scenarios, including highly dynamic scenarios. Since the received polarization state is fixed during the channel coherence time, we can coherently stack the received polarization state to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the estimation accuracy of CPR, thereby achieving high authentication accuracy under ultra-low SNR. Moreover, since the transmitted polarization state of various transmitters is different, because of their unique hardware deficiencies, and since the CPR is dependent on the transmitted polarization state, the CPR of other transmitters is different, allowing the resolution of co- located attacks. We theoretically drive the false alarm probability, detection probability, optimal discriminant threshold, computational complexity, optimal stacking numbers, and optimal CPR points for authentication. Furthermore, extensive simulations and experiments are performed to verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The evolution of quantum computers poses a serious threat to contemporary public-key encryption (PKE) schemes. To address this impending issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently undertaking the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project intending to evaluate and subsequently standardize the suitable PQC scheme(s). One such attractive approach, called Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), has entered the final round of the competition. Despite having some attractive features, the IND-CCA security of BIKE depends on the average decoder failure rate (DFR), a higher value of which can facilitate a particular type of side-channel attack. Although BIKE adopts the Black-Grey-Flip (BGF) decoder that offers a negligible DFR, the effect of weak-keys on the average DFR has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we implement the BIKE scheme, and then through extensive experiments show that the weak-keys can be a potential threat to IND-CCA security of the BIKE scheme and thus need attention from the relevant research community. We also propose a key-check algorithm that can potentially supplement the BIKE mechanism and prevent users from adopting weak-keys.}

	abstract = {Inference of machine learning models with data privacy guarantees has been widely studied as privacy concerns are getting growing attention from the community. Among others, secure inference based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has proven its utility by providing stringent data privacy at sometimes affordable cost. Still, previous work was restricted to shallow and narrow neural networks and simple tasks due to the high computational cost incurred from FHE. In this paper, we propose a more efficient way of evaluating convolutions with FHE, where the cost remains constant regardless of the kernel size, resulting in 12–\n46×\ntiming improvement on various kernel sizes. Combining our methods with FHE bootstrapping, we achieve at least 18.9% (and 48.1%) timing reduction in homomorphic evaluation of 20-layer CNN classifiers (and a part of it) on CIFAR10/100 (and ImageNet, respectively) datasets. Furthermore, in consideration of our methods being effective for evaluating CNNs with intensive convolutional operations and exploring such CNNs, we achieve at least\n5×\nfaster inference on CIFAR10/100 with FHE than the prior works having the same or less accuracy.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a hardware-reuse strong physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the intrinsic transfer paths (TPs) of a conventional digital multiplier to achieve a strong modeling attack resilience. With the multiplier input employed as the PUF challenge and the path delay as the entropy source, all the possible valid propagation paths from distinct input/output pairs can serve as PUF primitives. We can quantize the path delay using a time-to-digital converter (TDC), and select the suitable TDC output bits as the PUF response. We further propose a lightweight dynamic obfuscation algorithm (DOA) and a secure mutual authentication protocol to counteract modeling attacks. The proposed strong PUF using a\n32×32\nmultiplier as implemented in the Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 SoC features a total of 2048 intrinsic PUF primitives, while achieving a response stream (RS) with an average of 1024 responses per TDC output bit per challenge. With\nBit(5)\nand\nBit(6)\nof the TDC output selected for PUF response generation, they demonstrate a measured reliability and uniqueness of up to 98.31% and 49.34%, respectively, with their excellent randomness performance as validated by the NIST SP800-22 tests. Under machine learning (ML)-based modeling attack with artificial neural network (ANN), the measured prediction accuracy of both\nBit(5)\nand\nBit(6)\ncan still be maintained at\n∼50%\nwith a total of >200 million CRPs as the training set.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) carriers are an essential building block of fifth-generation (5G) systems. Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB.}

	abstract = {We propose a new approach for privacy-preserving and verifiable convolutional neural network (CNN) testing in a distrustful multi-stakeholder environment. The approach is aimed to enable that a CNN model developer convinces a user of the truthful CNN performance over non-public data from multiple testers, while respecting model and data privacy. To balance the security and efficiency issues, we appropriately integrate three tools with the CNN testing, including collaborative inference, homomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK). We start with strategically partitioning a CNN model into a private part kept locally by the model developer, and a public part outsourced to an outside server. Then, the private part runs over the HE-protected test data sent by a tester, and transmits its outputs to the public part for accomplishing subsequent computations of the CNN testing. Second, the correctness of the above CNN testing is enforced by generating zk-SNARK based proofs, with an emphasis on optimizing proving overhead for two-dimensional (2-D) convolution operations, since the operations dominate the performance bottleneck during generating proofs. We specifically present a new quadratic matrix program (QMP)-based arithmetic circuit with a single multiplication gate for expressing 2-D convolution operations between multiple filters and inputs in a batch manner. Third, we aggregate multiple proofs with respect to a same CNN model but different testers’ test data (i.e., different statements) into one proof, and ensure that the validity of the aggregated proof implies the validity of the original multiple proofs. Lastly, our experimental results demonstrate that our QMP-based zk-SNARK performs nearly $13.9\\times $ faster than the existing quadratic arithmetic program (QAP)-based zk-SNARK in proving time, and $17.6\\times $ faster in Setup time, for high-dimension matrix multiplication. Besides, the limitation on handling a bounded number of multiplications of QAP-based zk-SNARK is relieved.}

	abstract = {Cloud-edge computing is a new paradigm for data sharing. Many computation tasks are assigned to multiple edge nodes to mitigate the computing burden of the cloud and data is also outsourced to them to provide real-time services for IoT devices. However, two major issues remain, namely data privacy and real-world deployment. According to the data privacy rights and principles that stated by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data access control, restriction of data processing and finding inaccuracy data are critical issues that should be tackled in cloud-edge computing. Besides, since there are various types of devices and many of them are resource-constrained, how to efficiently apply deployment in cloud-edge computing is challenging for practice. In this work, we propose a new cryptographic primitive Controllable Outsourced Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (COAB-PRE) and a universal WebAssembly-based implementation framework for cross-platform deployment. In particular, COAB-PRE achieves bilateral and distributed access control whereby data producers and data consumers can both specify policies the other party must satisfy without a centralized access control server. The property, that we called controllable delegation, restricts the data processing on the edge nodes. COAB-PRE also supports comprehensive verifiability to find out a wrong result produced by the edge nodes and locate the misbehaved one. Moreover, we further discussed the potential property of COAB-PRE and put forward an improved scheme with high efficiency on devices. We also implemented our scheme using the approach and deployed it on different devices for experiment. All theoretical and experimental results indicate that our solution is secure and practical, and our implementation is suitable for cloud-edge computing.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the confidentiality issue of wireless sensor networks under communication constraints from the perspective of an eavesdropper. The considered communication constraints include both medium access constraint and bandwidth limitation. Specifically, the former results in only one sink node gaining access to the shared network at each time step, while the latter requires data to be quantized by a probabilistic quantizer before being transmitted. The task of the eavesdropper is to develop eavesdropping strategies for the constrained network to infer the state of the system as accurately as possible. Since the data is generally unreadable to unauthorized third parties in terms of secure transmission, an eavesdropper with limited power must decide which sink nodes’ data needs to be decrypted. By analyzing the impact of different decryption strategies on the eavesdropping performance, a deciphering scheduling is proposed, which minimizes the expected estimation error without exceeding the energy budget. Besides, a recursive reset algorithm is put forward based on the properties of the probabilistic quantizer, which reflects that an eavesdropper can infer whether its own estimate is accurate enough from the decoded data. Moreover, a sufficient condition is established in which the eavesdropping performance is improved under the proposed algorithm. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the developed approaches.}

	abstract = {As the applications of biometric recognition systems are increasing rapidly, there is a growing need to secure the sensitive data used within these systems. Considering privacy challenges in such systems, different biometric template protection (BTP) schemes were proposed in the literature, and the ISO/IEC 24745 standard defined a number of requirements for protecting biometric templates. While there are several studies on evaluating different requirements of the ISO/IEC 24745 standard, there have been few studies on how to measure the linkability of biometric templates. In this paper, we propose a new method for measuring linkability of protected biometric templates. The proposed method is based on maximal leakage, which is a well-studied measure in information-theoretic literature. We show that the resulting linkability measure has a number of important theoretical properties and an operational interpretation in terms of statistical hypothesis testing. We compare the proposed measure to two other linkability measures: one previously introduced in the literature, and a similar measure based on differential privacy. In our experiments, we use the proposed measure to evaluate the linkability of biometric templates from different biometric characteristics (face, voice, and finger vein), which are protected with different BTP schemes. The source codes of our proposed measure and all experiments are publicly available.}

	abstract = {Sharding technology is crucial to achieve decentralization, scalability, and security simultaneously. However, existing sharding blockchain schemes suffer from high cross-shard transaction processing latency, low parallelism, incomplete cross-shard views of shard members, centralized reconfiguration, high overhead of randomness generation, and lack of formalized protocol design and security proofs. This paper proposes a flexible sharding (FS) blockchain protocol. First, a cross-shard Byzantine fault tolerance (CSBFT) protocol is designed to cut down confirmation delays when processing cross-shard transactions. Second, we utilize multiple parallel CSBFT where each node acts not only as a leader but also as multiple ordinary members to break through the performance bottleneck caused by a leader’s bandwidth and computing power, improving the system parallelism. Third, a cross-shard transaction censorship attack is proposed, and a cross-shard view-change mechanism is designed to defend against it. Fourth, a secure and truly decentralized shard reconfiguration method combining proof-of-work, proof-of-possession, and intra-shard BFT is designed. Fifth, we utilize a formal protocol design method and give strict security proof for each protocol. Finally, we evaluate FS from both theoretical and practical perspectives. FS is proven to have lower communication and computation complexity and achieve considerable performance.}

We first examine the statistics considering the linearity of the scrambled data and the repetition property of the spreading code. Based on this, we then propose an improved estimation algorithm for the feedback polynomial of the linear scrambler constituting a search process and a verification process of feedback polynomial candidates to determine the correct feedback polynomial of the scrambler. To validate the proposed algorithm, we show through computer simulations that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of estimation performance.}

	abstract = {The automatic identification system (AIS) is the automatic tracking system for automatic traffic control and collision avoidance services, which plays an important role in maritime traffic safety. However, it faces a possible security threat when the maritime mobile service identity (MMSI) that specifies the vessels’ identity in AIS is illegally counterfeited. To guarantee the communication security of AIS for preventing fraudulent devices, we design a novel lightweight Transformer-based network GLFormer for specific emitter identification (SEI) to provide an extra security layer for AIS terminal emitters. Concretely, the gated local attention unit (GLAU) and the gated sliding local attention unit (GSLAU) modules that combine a simplified gated attention unit (GAU) and a sliding local self-attention (SLA) are developed in GLFormer to extract the radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) features automatically from the raw in-phase signals. Especially, the simplified GAU focuses on more critical RFF features and filters out the irrelevant information from the raw signal to improve performance, which is also a single-head self-attention module with fewer parameters for lightweight. Meanwhile, the SLA limits self-attention operation to a window, introducing the inductive bias of local information to enhance performance further and reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linearity for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the GLFormer achieves 96.31% and 89.38% identification accuracy in the constructed AIS transient and AIS steady-state datasets with 50 vessels, respectively. The 99.90% identification accuracy is achieved in the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) dataset with ten devices. It is not only better than the existing methods but requires much fewer parameters and lower computational complexity; besides, it is also suitable for working with long signal sequences.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) can classify wireless devices by analyzing the signal distortions caused by intrinsic hardware impairments. Recently, state-of-the-art neural networks have been adopted for RFFI. However, many neural networks, e.g., multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), require fixed-size input data. In addition, many IoT devices work in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios but the RFFI performance in such scenarios is often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the reason why MLP- and CNN-based RFFI systems are constrained by the input size. To overcome this, we propose four neural networks that can process signals of variable lengths, namely flatten-free CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) network, gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, and transformer. We adopt data augmentation during training which can significantly improve the model’s robustness to noise. We compare two augmentation schemes, namely offline and online augmentation. The results show the online one performs better. During the inference, a multi-packet inference approach is further leveraged to improve the classification accuracy in low SNR scenarios. We take LoRa as a case study and evaluate the system by classifying 10 commercial-off-the-shelf LoRa devices in various SNR conditions. The online augmentation can boost the low-SNR classification accuracy by up to 50% and the multi-packet inference approach can further increase the accuracy by over 20%.}

	abstract = {Deep learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has been widely and successfully adopted in many critical applications for its high effectiveness and efficiency. The rapid development of DNNs has benefited from the existence of some high-quality datasets (\ne.g\n., ImageNet), which allow researchers and developers to easily verify the performance of their methods. Currently, almost all existing released datasets require that they can only be adopted for academic or educational purposes rather than commercial purposes without permission. However, there is still no good way to ensure that. In this paper, we formulate the protection of released datasets as verifying whether they are adopted for training a (suspicious) third-party model, where defenders can only query the model while having no information about its parameters and training details. Based on this formulation, we propose to embed external patterns via backdoor watermarking for the ownership verification to protect them. Our method contains two main parts, including dataset watermarking and dataset verification. Specifically, we exploit poison-only backdoor attacks (\ne.g\n., BadNets) for dataset watermarking and design a hypothesis-test-guided method for dataset verification. We also provide some theoretical analyses of our methods. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of different tasks are conducted, which verify the effectiveness of our method.

	abstract = {In practical applications, the generalization capability of face anti-spoofing (FAS) models on unseen domains is of paramount importance to adapt to diverse camera sensors, device drift, environmental variation, and unpredictable attack types. Recently, various domain generalization (DG) methods have been developed to improve the generalization capability of FAS models via training on multiple source domains. These DG methods commonly require collecting sufficient real-world attack samples of different attack types for each source domain. This work aims to learn a FAS model without using any real-world attack sample in any source domain but can generalize well to the unseen domain, which can significantly reduce the learning cost. Toward this goal, we draw inspiration from the theoretical error bound of domain generalization to use negative data augmentation instead of real-world attack samples for training. We show that using only a few types of simple synthesized negative samples, e.g., color jitter and color mask, the learned model can achieve competitive performance over state-of-the-art DG methods trained using real-world attack samples. Moreover, a dynamic global common loss and a local contrast loss are proposed to prompt the model to learn a compact and common feature representation for real face samples from different source domains, which can further improve the generalization capability. Experimental results of extensive cross-dataset testing demonstrate that our method can even outperform state-of-the-art DG methods using real-world attack samples for training.

	abstract = {Modern privacy regulations grant citizens the right to be forgotten by products, services and companies. In case of machine learning (ML) applications, this necessitates deletion of data not only from storage archives but also from ML models. Due to an increasing need for regulatory compliance required for ML applications, machine unlearning is becoming an emerging research problem. The right to be forgotten requests come in the form of removal of a certain set or class of data from the already trained ML model. Practical considerations preclude retraining of the model from scratch after discarding the deleted data. The few existing studies use either the whole training data, or a subset of training data, or some metadata stored during training to update the model weights for unlearning. However, strict regulatory compliance requires time-bound deletion of data. Thus, in many cases, no data related to the training process or training samples may be accessible even for the unlearning purpose. We therefore ask the question: is it possible to achieve unlearning with zero training samples? In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of zero-shot machine unlearning that caters for the extreme but practical scenario where zero original data samples are available for use. We then propose two novel solutions for zero-shot machine unlearning based on (a) error minimizing-maximizing noise and (b) gated knowledge transfer. These methods remove the information of the forget data from the model while maintaining the model efficacy on the retain data. The zero-shot approach offers good protection against the model inversion attacks and membership inference attacks. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Anamnesis Index (AIN) to effectively measure the quality of the unlearning method. The experiments show promising results for unlearning in deep learning models on benchmark vision data-sets. The source code is available here: https://github.com/ayu987/zero-shot-unlearning}

	abstract = {The development of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has recently advanced the research of physical layer security (PLS). Beneficial impacts of RIS include but are not limited to offering a new degree-of-freedom (DoF) for key-less PLS optimization, and increasing channel randomness for physical layer secret key generation (PL-SKG). However, there is a lack of research studying how adversarial RIS can be used to attack and obtain legitimate secret keys generated by PL-SKG. In this work, we show an Eve-controlled adversarial RIS (Eve-RIS), by inserting into the legitimate channel a random and reciprocal channel, can partially reconstruct the secret keys from the legitimate PL-SKG process. To operationalize this concept, we design Eve-RIS schemes against two PL-SKG techniques used: (i) the CSI-based PL-SKG, and (ii) the two-way cross multiplication based PL-SKG. The channel probing at Eve-RIS is realized by compressed sensing designs with a small number of radio-frequency (RF) chains. Then, the optimal RIS phase is obtained by maximizing the Eve-RIS inserted deceiving channel. Our analysis and results show that even with a passive RIS, our proposed Eve-RIS can achieve a high key match rate with legitimate users, and is resistant to most of the current defensive approaches. This means the novel Eve-RIS provides a new eavesdropping threat on PL-SKG, which can spur new research areas to counter adversarial RIS attacks.}

	abstract = {The deepening of digital transformation has led to an increasing amount of data from industries being transmitted over the Internet. However, packets in plaintext originally designed for transmission in private networks suffer from significant security threats on the Internet. Unfortunately, existing encryption schemes, such as the representative TLS, are difficult to be applied to these industrial protocols due to their specific requirements and conditions such as low latency requirements and restricted operating environments. In this paper, we present a high-performance encryption/decryption middlebox called GuardBox to provide confidentiality and integrity for packets. GuardBox is expected to transparently encrypt/decrypt packets sent/received by protected industrial equipment with low latency and supports almost any application-layer protocol. To do that, we design a high-performance packet I/O framework and an optimized encryption/decryption scheme for GuardBox. More importantly, we use commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, to ensure the security of keys and the encryption/decryption process. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that GuardBox can provide confidentiality and integrity for packets transmitted over the Internet with low latency and a near-native throughput.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting is exploited to analyze encrypted traffic traces and infer the visited website. Existing website fingerprinting methods can achieve satisfying performance for the HTTP traffic visiting websites over TCP. Recently, a new protocol QUIC has been proposed, and HTTP-over-QUIC has been formalized as the next generation HTTP, named HTTP/3. Thus, it is necessary to classify HTTP/3 traces. However, since HTTP/3 is newly proposed and is being deployed, it is difficult to collect a large number of HTTP/3 traces. Intuitively, we can use sufficient TCP traces to improve the performance of the QUIC trace classifier. Unfortunately, the protocol discrepancy exists between TCP and QUIC traces, which undermines the generalization ability of the classifier. In this paper, for practical website fingerprinting of HTTP/3, we propose a Website-Aware Protocol Confusion Network (WAPCN), which exploits only a few QUIC traces to train a website classifier with the help of lots of available TCP traces. It consists of four main parts: a feature extractor, a website classifier, a protocol discriminator, and a website-aware adaptor. The feature extractor aims to extract trace representations from both TCP and QUIC traces. It cooperates with the website classifier to learn the discriminative representation for the website classification. The role of the protocol discriminator is to confuse protocols and guide the feature extractor to learn protocol-invariant representations. The website-aware adaptor can enhance protocol-invariant representations to be aware of the website classification boundary. Extensive experiments are conducted on various tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of WAPCN.}

Cache-based SCAs take advantage of cache inherent timing properties on shared memory systems to extract security-critical information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to mitigate cache-based SCAs on distributed many-core systems, based on a resource management technique. Our solution leverages dynamic task migration as a mechanism to ensure a secure execution scenario for security-critical applications. Additionally, we propose a resource-management-based mechanism to ensure a secure execution when migration is not possible due to a lack of available resources. We evaluate our solution in terms of gained security and performance impact using the Sniper simulator for different configurations. Results show that our technique effectively develops resilience against SCAs, while causing a low performance slowdown (1.6% on average, 9% worst case). For all tested benchmarks, our worst-case performance slowdown is 20% less than a state-of-the-art countermeasure. Moreover, our solution utilizes less than 1 ms of system run-time overhead for a 64 core platform with 100% utilization.}

	abstract = {Combining multiple classifiers is a promising approach to hardening forensic detectors against adversarial evasion attacks. The key idea is that an attacker must fool all individual classifiers to evade detection. The 1.5C classifier is one of these multiple-classifier detectors that is attack-agnostic, and thus even increases the difficulty for an omniscient attacker. Recent work evaluated the 1.5C classifier with SPAM features for image manipulation detection. Despite showing promising results, their security analysis leaves several aspects unresolved. Surprisingly, the results reveal that fooling only one component is often sufficient to evade detection. Additionally, the authors evaluate classifier robustness with only a black-box attack because, currently, there is no white-box attack against SPAM feature-based classifiers. This paper addresses these shortcomings and complements the previous security analysis. First, we develop a novel white-box attack against SPAM feature-based detectors. The proposed attack produces adversarial images with lower distortion than the previous attack. Second, by analyzing the 1.5C classifier’s acceptance region, we identify three pitfalls that explain why the current 1.5C classifier is less robust than a binary classifier in some settings. Third, we illustrate how to mitigate these pitfalls with a simple axis-aligned split classifier. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the increased robustness of the proposed detector for SPAM feature-based image manipulation detection.}

Due to poor ridge quality and partial observations, however, performance of the state-of-the-art fingerprint pose estimation algorithms remains unsatisfactory. In this study, we propose to fuse voting strategy and deep network to estimate fingerprint center and direction. Rather than regressing them directly, we predict dense offset maps and vote for the final estimation. Experimental results on ten fingerprint datasets with over 60K fingerprints show that (1) highly consistent fingerprint pose estimations are obtained across different impressions of the same finger, (2) performance of fingerprint indexing and verification is further improved thanks to more accurate fingerprint pose estimation, and (3) the proposed approach is more robust to sensing technologies (optical, capacitive, inking, and direct imaging) and impression types (rolled, plain, latent, and contactless).}

	abstract = {Traffic analysis is widely used in network monitoring. However, the attackers can sometimes infer sensitive information from the patterns of the encrypted network traffic, which poses a threat to network security. Most existing countermeasures are proposed to obfuscate traffic flows using adversarial examples. However, there are two challenges when adding perturbations to live network traffic. Firstly, the perturbations imposed on the feature space cannot be conveniently projected to original traffic flows in feature-space based methods. Secondly, it is laborious and impractical to apply symmetrical framework to encode/decode the adversarial traffic in traffic-space based approaches. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose an asymmetric defending scheme, namely Prism, to protect the live connection privacy against attacks of temporal network traffic analyzers. Specifically, Prism first extracts standardized temporal features via Power-Law Division (PLD) algorithm, and then employs Time-stacked State Transition Model (TSTM) to obtain the fingerprint of each application. Finally, Prism defends against the analyzers with online traffic perturbation. Since the Prism is designed as a traffic-space based defender with asymmetric defending structure, the deployment is lightweight and efficient. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our adversarial perturbations. In particular, it is encouraging to see that our proposed defending scheme outperforms the advanced countermeasures, such as adversarial training and traffic filter.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a prominent machine learning paradigm which helps tackle data privacy issues by allowing clients to store their raw data locally and transfer only their local model parameters to an aggregator server to collaboratively train a shared global model. However, federated learning is vulnerable to inference attacks from dishonest aggregators who can infer information about clients’ training data from their model parameters. To deal with this issue, most of the proposed schemes in literature either require a non-colluded server setting, a trusted third-party to compute master secret keys or a secure multiparty computation protocol which is still inefficient over multiple iterations of computing an aggregation model. In this work, we propose an efficient cross-silo federated learning scheme with strong privacy preservation. By designing a double-layer encryption scheme which has no requirement to compute discrete logarithm, utilizing secret sharing only at the establishment phase and in the iterations when parties rejoin, and accelerating the computation performance via parallel computing, we achieve an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning protocol, which also allows clients to dropout and rejoin during the training process. The proposed scheme is demonstrated theoretically and empirically to provide provable privacy against an honest-but-curious aggregator server and simultaneously achieve desirable model utilities. The scheme is applied to false data injection attack detection (FDIA) in smart grids. This is a more secure cross-silo FDIA federated learning resilient to the local private data inference attacks than the existing works.}

	abstract = {In smart grids, various Internet-of-Things-based (IoT-based) components are massively deployed across the power systems. However, most of these IoT-based components have their own vulnerabilities, leveraging which malicious users can launch different cyber/physical attacks to steal electricity. Economic losses caused by electricity theft amount to\n$96\nbillion in 2017. Most existing electricity theft detection techniques suffer from either a high deployment cost or a low detection accuracy. To address these concerns, we propose a novel Electricity Theft Detector based upon Convolutional Long Short Term Memory neural networks, called ETD-ConvLSTM. By installing a central observer meter in each community, we can know which communities have malicious users. For these communities, users’ time series of electricity consumptions with temporal correlations are transformed into spatio-temporal sequence data, mainly by constructing a two-dimensional matrix containing both consumptions and consumption differences among several adjacent days. This matrix is then divided into a sequence of sub-matrices, which are then fed into a ConvLSTM network consisting of multiple stacked ConvLSTM layers, with each layer formed by several temporarily concatenated ConvLSTM nodes. When capturing the periodicity in users’ consumption patterns, the ETD-ConvLSTM method considers both global and local knowledge, and hence the detection accuracy improves significantly. Simulations results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art detectors, the proposed ETD-ConvLSTM method can obtain better or comparable performance in terms of detection accuracy, false negative rates and false positive rates within much shorter detection time.}

	abstract = {Private neural network inference has demonstrated great importance in various privacy-critical scenarios. However, the primary challenge remaining in prior works is that the evaluation on encrypted data levies prohibitively high runtime and communication overhead. In this work, we present FastSecNet , an efficient two-party cryptographic framework for private inference in the dealer-based pre-processing setting. Specifically, 1) FastSecNet provides an efficient ReLU protocol for the evalution of non-linear layers, which is built up on a recent advanced cryptographic primitive, function secret sharing (FSS). The core of this construction are an optimized ReLU representation and a customized FSS-based ReLU protocol. 2) For linear layer evaluation, we first propose an efficient PRG-based pre-processing protocol based on the fact that one of the inputs is uniformly random in the offline phase. Then, the online phase only communicates one element and consists of lightweight secret-sharing operations in a ring. Extensive evaluations conducted on 4 real-world datasets and 9 neural network models demonstrate that during the online phase, FastSecNet achieves\n14×\nless runtime and\n18×\nless communication cost compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {Advancements in deep learning enable neural network (NN) inference to be a service, but service providers and clients want to keep their inputs secret for privacy protection. Private Inference is the task of evaluating NN without leaking private inputs. Existing secure multiparty computation (MPC)-based solutions mainly focus on fixed bit-width methodology, such as 32 and 64 bits. Binary Neural Network (BNN) is efficient when evaluated in MPC and has achieved reasonable accuracy for commonly used datasets, but prior private BNN inference solutions, which focus on Boolean Circuits, are still costly in communication and run-time. In this paper, we introduce FLEX BNN, a fast private BNN inference framework using three-party computation (3PC) in Arithmetic Circuits against semi-honest adversaries with honest-majority. In FLEX BNN, we propose to employ flexible and small bit-width equipped with a seamless bit-width conversion method and design several specific optimizations towards the basic operations: i) We propose bit-width determination methods for Matrix Multiplication and Sign-based Activation function. ii) We integrate Batch Normalization and Max-Pooling into the Sign-based Activation function for better efficiency. iii) More importantly, we achieve seamless bit-width conversion within the Sign-based Activation function with no additional cost. Extensive experiments illustrate that FLEX BNN outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in communication, run-time, and scalability. On average, FLEX BNN is $11\\times $ faster than XONN (USENIX Security’19) in LAN, $46\\times $ (resp. $9.3\\times $ ) faster than QUOTIENT (ACM CCS’19) in LAN (resp. WAN), $10\\times $ faster than BANNERS (ACM IH&MMSec’21) in LAN, and 1.1- $2.9\\times $ (resp. 1.5- $2.7\\times $ ) faster than FALCON (semi-honest, PoPETs’21) in LAN (resp. WAN), and improves the respective communication by $500\\times $ , $127\\times $ , and 1.3- $1.5\\times $ compared to XONN, BANNERS, and FALCON.}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving aggregation protocol is an essential building block in privacy-enhanced federated learning (FL), which enables the server to obtain the sum of users’ locally trained models while keeping local training data private. However, most of the work on privacy-preserving aggregation provides privacy guarantees for only one communication round in FL. In fact, as FL usually involves long-term training, i.e., multiple rounds, it may lead to more information leakages due to the dynamic user participation over rounds. In this connection, we propose a long-term privacy-preserving aggregation (LTPA) protocol providing both single-round and multi-round privacy guarantees. Specifically, we first introduce our batch-partitioning-dropping-updating (BPDU) strategy that enables any user-dynamic FL system to provide multi-round privacy guarantees. Then we present our LTPA construction which integrates our proposed BPDU strategy with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving aggregation protocol. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of LTPA parameter settings on the trade-off between privacy guarantee, protocol efficiency, and FL convergence performance from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Experimental results show that LTPA provides similar complexity to that of the state-of-the-art, i.e., an additional cost of around only 1.04X for a 100,000-user FL system, with an additional long-term privacy guarantee.}

	abstract = {As the demand for highly secure and dependable lightweight systems increases in the modern world, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) continue to promise a lightweight alternative to high-cost encryption techniques and secure key storage. While the security features promised by PUFs are highly attractive for secure system designers, they have been shown to be vulnerable to various sophisticated attacks - most notably Machine Learning (ML) based modelling attacks (ML-MA) which attempt to digitally clone the PUF behaviour and thus undermine their security. More recent ML-MA have even exploited publicly known helper data required for PUF error correction in order to predict PUF responses without requiring knowledge of response data. In response to this, research is beginning to emerge regarding the authentication of PUF devices with the assistance of ML as opposed to traditional PUF techniques of storage and comparison of pre-known Challenge-Response pairs (CRPs). In this article, we propose a classification system using ML based on a novel ‘PUF-Phenotype’ concept to accurately identify the origin and determine the validity of noisy memory-derived (DRAM) PUF responses as an alternative to helper data-reliant denoising techniques. To our best knowledge, we are the first to perform classification over multiple devices per model to enable a group-based PUF authentication scheme. We achieve up to 98% classification accuracy using a modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction in conjunction with several well-established classifiers. We also experimentally verified the performance of our model on a Raspberry Pi device to determine the suitability of deploying our proposed model in a resource-constrained environment.}

	abstract = {Edge caching has been envisioned as a promising technology in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) to proximally cache (video) contents. Nevertheless, as massive resources (e.g., energy, storage, computing, and bandwidth) are consumed to cache contents, edge caching devices (ECDs) are unwilling to provide caching services. In addition, as the ECDs are usually deployed by untrusted third parties, the cached contents may be illegally accessed, which results in the mobile users’ privacy leakage. To efficiently address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel secure edge caching scheme for video contents in HetNets. Specifically, to motivate the participation of ECDs, the Nash bargaining game is exploited to model the negotiations between the content provider and ECDs, where the optimal requested caching space of the content provider and the optimal caching price of each ECD are jointly analyzed. Apart from this, to protect the content secrecy, scalable video coding is employed to facilitate secure edge caching, where the ECDs are only utilized to cache the enhancement layers that cannot be independently decoded to reconstruct the original contents. Then, we formulate a non-convex 0–1 integer programming problem to optimize the enhancement layer caching on ECDs, and the modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the problem optimally. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides secure and efficient content caching for mobile users.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of an untrusted relay assisted over-the-air computation (AirComp) network, where each node is equipped with multiple antennas and the relay is operated in an amplify-and-forward mode. The relay receives the data from each sensor and sends them to the access point (AP) in the first and second time slot, respectively. The AP applies artificial noise (AN) to protect the aggregation of sensors’ data from being wiretapped by the untrusted relay in the first time slot. In particular, we are interested in minimizing the computation distortion measured by the mean-squared error (MSE) via jointly optimizing beamforming matrices at all nodes, subject to the MSE constraint at the relay and individual power constraints at the AP, the relay and each sensor. In the case of the perfect channel state information (CSI), we convert the nonconvex MSE minimization problem into a difference-of-convex (DC) form and propose a constrained concave-convex procedure that can obtain a local minimum to solve the DC problem. We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where the additional interference term due to incomplete interference cancellation is considered, and the nonconvex robust MSE minimization problem is solved by a proposed inexact block coordinate descent algorithm. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.}

Attackers in some situations are more like intelligent agents with initiative, who can transform their attack strategies purposefully according to the actions of defenders. Thus, we propose a new defense strategy against the interaction between the attacker and the defender which is solved by optimization learning.

	abstract = {DeepFake face swapping presents a significant threat to online security and social media, which can replace the source face in an arbitrary photo/video with the target face of an entirely different person. In order to prevent this fraud, some researchers have begun to study the adversarial methods against DeepFake or face manipulation. However, existing works mainly focus on the white-box setting or the black-box setting driven by abundant queries, which severely limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle this problem, we introduce a practical adversarial attack that does not require any queries to the facial image forgery model. Our method is built on a substitute model based on face reconstruction and then transfers adversarial examples from the substitute model directly to inaccessible black-box DeepFake models. Specially, we propose the Transferable Cycle Adversary Generative Adversarial Network (TCA-GAN) to construct the adversarial perturbation for disrupting unknown DeepFake systems. We also present a novel post-regularization module for enhancing the transferability of generated adversarial examples. To comprehensively measure the effectiveness of our approaches, we construct a challenging baseline of DeepFake adversarial attacks for future development. Extensive experiments impressively show that the proposed adversarial attack method makes the visual quality of DeepFake face images plummet so that they are easier to be detected by humans and algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be generalized to offer face image protection against various face translation methods.}

	abstract = {Security incidents such as scams and hacks have become a major threat to the health of the blockchain ecosystem, resulting in billions of dollars in losses to blockchain users each year. To reveal the real-world entities behind pseudonymous blockchain accounts and recover stolen funds from massive transaction data, much effort has recently been put into tracing illicit financial flows in blockchain by academia and industry. However, most of the current blockchain fund tracing methods are heuristics and taint analysis methods that are designed on the basis of expert experience and specific events, which have limitations in terms of universality, effectiveness and efficiency. This paper models blockchain transaction records as a transaction graph and tackles blockchain transaction tracing as a graph search task. To achieve efficient and effective tracing of fund transfers on the transaction graphs, we propose a scalable transaction tracing tool, TRacer, which to the best of our knowledge is the first intelligent transaction tracing tool that is generalized to multiple account-based blockchain platforms and can handle complex transaction behavior in decentralized finance (DeFi). Particularly, we tackle the transaction tracing task via a subgraph searching approach which employ a novel ranking method to infer the relevance between accounts during the graph search process in the multi-relational blockchain transaction graph. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on datasets from multiple blockchain platforms demonstrate that TRacer can efficiently perform the transaction tracing task at a lower cost and achieve better tracing results than existing methods or even expert manual audits.}

	abstract = {Incremental pedestrian attribute recognition (IncPAR) aims to learn novel person attributes continuously and avoid the catastrophic forgetting, which is an essential problem for image forensic and security applications, e.g., suspect search. Different from the conventional continual learning for visual classification, we formulate the IncPAR as a problem of multi-label continual learning with incomplete labels (MCL-IL), where the training samples in a novel task are annotated with only a few categories of interest but may implicitly contain other attributes of previous tasks. The incomplete label assignments is a challenging and frequently-encountered issue in real-world multi-label classification applications due to a number of reasons, e.g., incomplete data collection, moderate budget for annotations, etc. To tackle the MCL-IL problem, we propose a self-training based approach via dual uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling (DUAPL) to transfer the knowledge learned in previous tasks to novel tasks. Specially, both kinds of uncertainties, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, are modeled to mitigate the negative influences of noisy pseudo labels induced by low quality samples and immature models learned by inadequate training in early tasks. Based on the DUAPL, more reliable supervision signals can be estimated to prevent the model evolution from forgetting attributes seen in previous tasks. For standard evaluations of MCL-IL methods, two benchmarks on IncPAR, termed RAP-CL and PETA-CL, are constructed by re-organizing public human attribute datasets. Extensive experiments have been performed on these benchmarks to compare the proposed method with multiple baselines. The superior performance in terms of both recognition accuracies and forgetting ratios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DUAPL for IncPAR.}

	abstract = {To know the most recent market conditions, an e-commerce platform needs to be aware of the sales situation of its sellers’ commodities. The most recent market conditions can help to forecast future market trends and develop policies to guide sellers in reasonably allocating their inventory proportion. Statistical analysis is a fundamental approach to studying the sales situation. However, the sales data of an e-commerce platform usually has a significant volume. Therefore, outsourcing statistical analysis to cloud servers is an effective method. Nevertheless, sellers do not want their sales data leaked to anyone or any other organization. Moreover, in many circumstances, we cannot fully trust cloud servers. Thus, we need to utilize cryptographic or non-cryptographic tools to realize the above outsourcing. Secret sharing is a lightweight and powerful non-cryptographic tool to realize privacy-preserving data analysis. However, it needs secure channels to distribute secret shares. On the other hand, homomorphic encryption is a powerful cryptographic tool for designing privacy-preserving data analysis schemes. Nevertheless, these schemes usually do not allow the entity that holds the decryption key to collude with other entities. We propose a privacy-preserving and verifiable statistical analysis scheme for an e-commerce platform that combines a threshold secret sharing scheme with a verifiable threshold homomorphic encryption scheme. Our solution’s demand for secure channels is reduced by $40\\%\\sim 60\\%$ compared with a traditional threshold secret sharing scheme, thanking the designed novel distribution model for delivering secret shares. Furthermore, our solution has a stronger ability to resist collusive attacks, keep sales data private from any entity, and ensure that the platform can only obtain the analysis results with the help of some cloud servers, alleviating the single point of trust. And meanwhile, the novel distributed model makes our solution enjoy better robustness and fault tolerance. The proposed solution is validated through security analyses, performance evaluations, and comparison analyses.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, a variety of GAN generated deepfake face images/videos have emerged endlessly. The abuse of deepfake has brought serious negative effects to many industries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop advanced methods to combat the abuse of deepfake. As far as we know, there are almost no techniques that can distinguish multiple types of homologous deepfake face images. In this study, we propose a method based on the multi-classification task to address this issue. The proposed method relies on a novel network framework named FCD-Net that consists of the facial synaptic saliency module (FSS), the contour detail feature extraction module (CDFE), and the distinguishing feature fusion module (DFF). Utilizing this method, the imperceptible features introduced by deepfake can be exposed, and the differences caused by different types of deepfake can be distinguished, even if deepfake images are homologous. To test the proposed method and compare it with other SOTA methods, we establish a new homologous dataset named HDFD that contains real face images, entire face synthesis images, face swap images, and facial attribute manipulation images. Among them, the three types of deepfake images are all generated from the same real face images through different deepfake techniques. Abundant experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method has a high-level detection accuracy and relatively strong robustness against content-preserving manipulations. Moreover, the generalization of our method is superior to other SOTA methods.}

	abstract = {The foundation of network management is to timely, accurately, and flexibly monitor the status of a managed network. Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.}

	abstract = {Side-informed steganography has always been among the most secure approaches in the field. However, a majority of existing methods for JPEG images use the side information, here the rounding error, in a heuristic way. For the first time, we show that the usefulness of the rounding error comes from its covariance with the embedding changes. Unfortunately, this covariance between continuous and discrete variables is not analytically available. An estimate of the covariance is proposed, which allows to model steganography as a change in the variance of DCT coefficients. Since steganalysis today is best performed in the spatial domain, we derive a likelihood ratio test to preserve a model of a decompressed JPEG image. The proposed method then bounds the power of this test by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the cover and stego distributions. We experimentally demonstrate in two popular datasets that it achieves state-of-the-art performance against deep learning detectors. Moreover, by considering a different pixel variance estimator for images compressed with Quality Factor 100, even greater improvements are obtained.}

	abstract = {Group signatures are active cryptographic topics where group members are granted right to sign messages anonymously on behalf of their group. However, in practical applications, such rights are not permanent in most cases and are usually limited to some time periods. This means that the signing right of each group member needs to be associated with time periods such that it can be automatically changed with the latter. Among the known approaches, verifier local revocation (VLR) seems to be the feasible one to implement the above functionality, but it will cause an inefficient verification process when the group size is large. In this paper, we describe a group signature scheme with time-bound keys, based on the hardness of lattice assumption, which implements the limitation of the signing right to any time period by constructing a lattice-based redactable signature scheme. Our scheme still adds VLR mechanism for some members who need to revoke prematurely, but the time-bound keys function ensures such members are only a small fraction that do not incur excessive cost for revocation check. We give implementation for our scheme under 93-bit and 207-bit security respectively to demonstrate the practicability–all costs are independent of the group size and achieve a relatively efficient level.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is a promising technology for next-generation indoor wireless broadband communication systems. Physical layer security (PLS) is one proposed method to ensure data security for VLC in public areas. However, most PLS studies in the literature neglect the reflections in the VLC channel and do not consider inter-symbol interference (ISI). This paper investigates the ISI effects on the secrecy rate in multiple-input single-output VLC systems where the reflections are not neglected for the cases of perfect and imperfect knowledge of the eavesdropper’s channel state information. We aim to compensate for the ISI effects by designing zero-forcing (ZF) and artificial noise (AN) beamformers. In addition, we formulate optimization problems to maximize the secrecy rate resulting in non-convex and NP-hard problems. Thus, we utilize the particle swarm optimization algorithm for solutions and also convert non-convex optimization problems into easily solvable linear problems. Furthermore, robust ZF and AN beamformers for the worst-case scenario are considered for the cases of ISI and no ISI. The results reveal that ISI severely degrades the secrecy rate; however, well-designed beamformers can reverse the ISI effects.}

	abstract = {In recent years, unconstrained iris biometrics has become more prevalent due to its wide range of user applications. However, it also presents numerous challenges to the Iris pre-processing task of Localization and Segmentation (ILS). Many ILS techniques have been proposed to address these challenges, among which the most effective is the CNN-based methods. Training the CNN is data-intensive, and most of the existing CNN-based ILS approaches do not incorporate iris-specific features that can reduce their data dependence, despite the limited labelled iris data in the available databases. These trained CNN models built upon these databases can be sub-optimal. Hence, this paper proposes a guided CNN-based ILS approach IrisGuideNet. IrisGuideNet involves incorporating novel iris-specific heuristics named Iris Regularization Term (IRT), deep supervision technique, and hybrid loss functions in the training pipeline, which guides the network and reduces the model data dependence. A novel Iris Infusion Module (IIM) that utilizes the geometrical relationships between the ILS outputs to refine the predicted outputs is introduced at network inference. The proposed model is trained and evaluated with various datasets. Experimental results show that IrisGuideNet has outperformed most models across all the database categories. The codes implementation of the proposed IrisGuideNet will be available at: https://github.com/mohdjawadi/IrisGuidenet .}

	abstract = {As a promising technique of resisting steganalysis detection, generative steganography usually generates a new image driven by secret information as the stego-image. However, it generally encodes secret information as entangled features in a non-distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation, which leads to two common issues: 1) limited accuracy of information extraction, and 2) low security in the feature-domain. To address the above limitations, we propose a generative steganographic framework via auto-generation of semantic object contours, in which a given secret message is encoded as the disentangled features, i.e., object-contours, in a distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation. In this framework, we propose a contour generative adversarial nets (CtrGAN) consisting of a contour-generator and a contour-discriminator, which are adversarially trained with reinforcement learning. To realize the generative steganography, by using the contour-generator of the trained CtrGAN, a contour point selection (CPS)-based encoding strategy is designed to encode the secret message as the contours. Then, the BicycleGAN is employed to transform the generated contours to the corresponding stego-image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed steganographic approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of information extraction accuracy, especially under common image attacks, and feature-domain security.}

	abstract = {Steganography based on fixed codebook has become one of the most important branches of speech steganography due to its high imperceptibility and having the largest available carrier space. As its countermeasure technique, this paper presents a novel steganalysis method based on separable convolution network (SepSteNet) with dual-stream pyramid enhanced strategy (DPES). Specifically, to better acquire discriminative representations, we design the pulse-aware separable block to capture the pulse correspondence along independent levels of pulse positions, where the pulse-aware excitation module is plugged to avoid noisy clue accumulation by adaptively emphasizing the salient part. Moreover, the global attending block is introduced to enhance correspondence features through calculating global responses at distinct subframes. In addition, to eliminate the negative impact of sample content, DPES is leveraged to incorporate cross-domain coherence features by the inverted connected dual-stream branches. With the original and calibration speech samples, two branches enable the correspondence of two detection feature domains to interact with each other to generate coherence features independent of sample content, thereby improving the detection performance. The performance of the presented method is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the state of the arts. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented method significantly outperforms the existing ones. Furthermore, DPES is shown to be a general enhancement strategy that can effectively improve the performance of the existing deep neural network for speech steganalysis.

	abstract = {The watermarking method, which adds unique watermarks to data, has been widely used for integrity attack detection in industrial control systems (ICSs). Existing literature generally designs watermarking mechanisms without considering the existence of noises, which cannot be trivially applied to realistic ICS scenarios in the presence of strong noise interference. On one hand, the low-intensity watermarking will be ineffective under the strong noise environment; while on the other hand, the oversized watermarking can possibly degrade the control performance or even destabilize the system. Therefore, the intensity of watermarks plays a fundamental role in balancing the tradeoff between detection effectiveness and control performance, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been thoroughly analyzed yet. To this end, in this paper, we for the first time propose an optimal watermarking design method for ICSs considering the detection-performance tradeoff. To begin with, we shift the watermark container from data points to segments and update the detection metrics to reduce the noise impact. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to determine the strength of watermarks to balance the detection-performance tradeoff. Meanwhile, the detection effectiveness and control performance metrics are analytically modeled and theoretically analyzed considering the discrepancy between added watermarks and noises, signal quality, detection latency, as well as estimation of detection metrics. Finally, extensive numerical simulations and systematical experiments based on a practical Ethanol Distillation ICS are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed watermarking method in comparison with related works.}

	abstract = {Zero Trust, as an emerging trend of cybersecurity paradigms in modern infrastructure (e.g., enterprise, cloud, edge, IoT, and 5G), is moving security defenses from static and perimeter-based control systems to focus on users and resources with no assumption of implicit trust. However, the current Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) mainly focuses on the network security and lacks in-depth considerations on system-level security policies and abstractions, which leaves the realization of the principle incomplete. To bridge the gap, we propose an innovative programmable system security framework called SYS FLOW to enable unified, dynamic, and fine-grained Zero Trust security control for system resources. SYS FLOW introduces a novel system flow abstraction to model system activities across the entire infrastructure, and provides a system-level data plane and control plane separation and abstraction. The new logically centralized controller accommodates a unified programmable Policy Decision Point (PDP) that acquires a holistic view of system behaviors for controlling system resource accesses by translating programmable security policies into system flow rules. The SYS FLOW data plane, acting as Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), enforces translated system flow rules, which can be updated dynamically and facilitate fine-grained responsive actions. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SYS FLOW, which addresses the security issues in various scenarios with a minor performance overhead.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV’s performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars have found applications in a wide range of domains, including human tracking, health monitoring, and autonomous driving, for their unobtrusive nature and high range accuracy. These capabilities, however, if used for malicious purposes, could also result in serious security and privacy issues. For example, a user’s daily life could be secretly monitored by a spy radar. Hence, there is a strong urge to develop systems that can detect and locate such spy radars. In this paper, we propose Radar2, a practical system for passive spy radar detection and localization using a single commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radar. Specifically, we propose a novel Frequency Component Detection method to detect the existence of mmWave signals, distinguish between mmWave radar and WiGig signals using a waveform classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and localize spy radars using triangulation based on the detector’s observations at multiple anchor points. Not only does Radar2 work for different types of mmWave radar, but it can also detect and localize multiple radars simultaneously. Finally, we performed extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of Radar2 in various settings. Our evaluation results show that the radar detection rate is above 96% and the localization error is within 0.3m. The results also reveal that Radar2 is robust against various environmental factors (e.g., room layout and human activities).}

	abstract = {This paper presents the first performance analysis of physical layer downlink secure transmissions in a scalable cell-free massive MIMO (SCF-mMIMO) system. A stochastic geometry approach is used to model the locations of the access points (APs), user equipments (UEs), and eavesdroppers (Eves) as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs). In addition to applying maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to send the confidential messages, null-space artificial noise is also injected for secrecy enhancement. We analytically characterize the secrecy performance in terms of both the outage-based secrecy transmission rate (STR) and the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR), appropriate for slow quasi-static fading channels and fast block-fading channels, respectively. By utilizing moment matching and Gil-Pelaez inversion theorem, we are able to obtain mathematically tractable approximations for the performance metrics. These approximations are shown to have high accuracy as compared to simulation results. Our numerical results reveal useful design insights that cannot be inferred from existing studies. These insights answer important questions such as whether it is best to deploy as many APs each with fewer antennas and to what extent the artificial noise insertion is beneficial.}

The scan-based Design-for-Testability (DfT) technique has also become the prime target of attackers whose aim is to extract the secret information embedded inside a chip by misusing its scan infrastructure. Several countermeasures have been proposed to protect the chip against scan-based attacks. Recently, obfuscation-based defense mechanisms have gained significant popularity, which protect scan data by corrupting some of the scan cell’s content. In this paper, we perform a detailed security analysis of three best-known obfuscation techniques, namely, static, dynamic, and advanced dynamic obfuscation techniques, designed to protect the AES crypto-chip. We exploit their vulnerabilities and propose a generic scan-based signature attack, leading to the leakage of the secret cipher key that too, using only one observable scan cell. We also propose upgrades to the two dynamic scan obfuscation techniques to patch the discovered vulnerabilities with negligible changes to the original design. In order to show the generality of the attack, we also applied our attack to the similar cipher PRESENT and seven other scan obfuscation techniques. The result shows that in addition to the above three best-known obfuscation techniques, five out of the seven other scan obfuscation techniques were also successfully broken by our generic attack.}

	abstract = {The purpose of privacy-preserving spam filtering is to inspect email while preserving the privacy of its detection rules and the email content. Although many solutions have emerged, they suffer from the following: 1) privacy provided is insufficient as the email content or detection rules may be exposed to third parties; 2) due to improper use of encryption, exhaustive word search attacks are possible, potentially breaking the confidentiality of encrypted emails; 3) when spam filtering is outsourced, email is given to the outsource, where user privacy may be compromised if privacy protection measures are not properly put in place; 4) confirmation of whether the encrypted email is spam is only determined after the receiver receives the email, which can lead to a situation in which spam is loaded to the memory of the receiver’s terminal for spam filtering. This can be harmful, for example, when an attacker inserts a web browser vulnerability into the body of an email to lure users to a phishing site simply by reading the email; 5) computationally expensive operations are unavoidable to provide required features of privacy-preserving spam filtering. We present Privacy-preserving Content-based Spam Filter (PCSF), which is a spam filter system that does not suffer from the aforementioned issues. Additionally, our system provides pre-validation before the receiver reads the email. We provide an implementation of our system based on the Naive Bayes spam filter and prove its security.}

Most existing studies focus on detecting anomalous nodes or edges but fail to detect anomalous motif instances. In this paper, we propose MADG, a general M otif-level A nomaly D etection framework for dynamic G raphs, which can identify the anomaly in different motifs. Motifs are specific subgraph structures that frequently occur in a network and have been widely used in network analysis. In order to learn discriminative motif-level representations and leverage the temporal information from the dynamic graph, we design motif-augmented GCN and temporal self-attention. We first use motif-augmented GCN to model the topological structure among nodes and motif instances to learn their representations at each snapshot. Then, we feed the representations of multiple snapshots into the self-attention layer with relative temporal encoding in order to capture the evolutionary patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MADG framework.}

	abstract = {Inter-app communication mechanism allows app developers to improve Android apps’ usability and provide users with rich functions via interacting with exposed components or performing data sharing. However, this mechanism may be leveraged by malicious developers or unintentionally misused by inexperienced developers. For end users, this type of attack may cause privacy breaches or remote controls of personal phone, which have a great threat of the user’s data security. The key to analyzing whether there is a collusion attack is to analyze the existence of communication channels between apps. The existing static analysis tools have done some work in this area, but the comprehensiveness of the analysis is insufficient, and such research lacks a unified test standard. In this paper, we present collusion attacks using more concealed inter-app communication channels, which can bypass existing security detection mechanisms. To defend against the new attacks, we design IAFDroid, an analysis framework that combines static and taint analysis. By examining 20K real-world apps, IAFDroid found that 94.4% of the most exposed components of Android may be leveraged to perform collusion attacks. Furthermore, the evaluation showed that the feature set extracted by IAFDroid could be used to promote the accuracy of Android malware detection. We contribute a more comprehensive benchmark for IAC analysis, IACBench, which includes the new attacks we propose. To facilitate follow-up studies, we open-sourced IAFDroid and IACBench based on the GPL agreement.}

Our analyses show that, compared to the covert capacity for classical AWGN channels, we can achieve a covertness gain of value 2 by leveraging Willie’s uncertainty of phase angles. This covertness gain is achieved when the number of possible phase angle pairs\nN=2\n.

	abstract = {In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.}

	abstract = {Subgraph counting aims to count over a large graph subgraphs matching a given shape (e.g., triangle), which plays an important role in various social graph analytics applications such as discovering social roles and characterizing social networks. Subgraph counting over social graphs, however, becomes quite challenging when the social graph to be analyzed is presented in a decentralized manner, where each user only holds a local view. Collecting the local views for subgraph counting-based analytics raises acute privacy concerns, because they capture the sensitive social relationships among individuals. In light of this, we design, implement, and evaluate MAGO, a new system aimed at maliciously secure subgraph counting on decentralized social graphs. MAGO is built from a delicate synergy of insights on graph analytics, lightweight cryptography, and local differential privacy, allowing individual users to securely contribute their local views on a decentralized social graph for a cloud-empowered subgraph counting service. In addition to the protection for data confidentiality, MAGO is also designed to protect against a malicious adversary that might try to tamper with the subgraph counting results. Extensive experiments over real-world social graph datasets demonstrate the practically affordable performance of MAGO for maliciously secure subgraph counting.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the threat of passive eavesdropping on downlink cell-free massive MIMO (CF-MaMIMO) systems, examining in a particular system under the effects of imperfect channel estimation. Physical layer security (PLS) techniques and power allocation algorithms are typically adopted to deteriorate the quality of eavesdropped signals. In the downlink stream, artificial noise (AN) is broadcasted simultaneously with the users’ data streams, with the aim of jamming the eavesdropper’s signal without sacrificing the quality of service (QoS). However, imperfect channel estimation results in AN leakage to legitimate users. Our work considers this condition, and the power allocation algorithms we present determine the minimum power that is needed to maintain the user’s QoS even in the presence of leaked AN. We first propose the cooperative PLS algorithm (COP), which facilitates AN broadcasting via access point (AP) cooperation. Unfortunately, this cooperation wastes some of the power used to send the AN and, in most cases, increases the computational complexity. We then present the independent PLS algorithm (IND), where the goal is to regain this power by allowing each AP to broadcast AN independently. However, to meet the feasibility criterion, this occurs at the cost of increasing the number of used antennas. This technique reduces the power allocation complexity but increases the computational complexities of the precoder design and the channel estimation process. Our results reveal that the proposed algorithms enhance the security performance of CF-MaMIMO. We evaluate such performance from numerous angles including the number of users, number of APs, QoS, beamforming, AN leakage, and channel estimation techniques.}

	abstract = {Cloud-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) overcomes the resource-constrained nature of the traditional IoT and is developing rapidly in such fields as smart grids and intelligent transportation. In a cloud-assisted IoT system, users can remotely control the IoT devices and send specific instructions to them. If the users’ identities are not verified, adversaries can pretend as legitimate users to send fake and malicious instructions to IoT devices, thereby compromising the security of the entire system. Thus, a sound authentication mechanism is indispensable to ensure security. At the same time, it should be noted that a gateway may connect to massive IoT devices with the exponential growth of interconnected devices in a cloud-assisted IoT system. The efficiency of authentication schemes is easily impacted by the computation capability of the gateway. Recently, several schemes have been designed for cloud-assisted IoT systems, but they have problems of one kind or another, making them not suitable for cloud-assisted IoT systems. In this paper, we take a typical scheme (proposed at IEEE TDSC 2020) as an example to identify the common weaknesses and challenges of designing a user authentication scheme for cloud-assisted IoT systems. In addition, we propose a new secure user authentication scheme with lightweight computation on gateways. The proposed scheme provides secure access between remote users and IoT devices with many ideal attributions, such as forward secrecy and multi-factor security. Meanwhile, the security of this scheme is proved under the random-oracle model, heuristic analysis, the ProVerif tool, and BAN logic. Compared with ten state-of-the-art schemes in security and performance, the proposed scheme achieves all the listed twelve security requirements with minimum computation and storage costs on gateways.}

	abstract = {Federated learning has gained extensive interest in recent years owing to its ability to update model parameters without obtaining raw data from users, which makes it a viable privacy-preserving machine learning model for collaborative distributed learning among various devices. However, due to the fact that adversaries can track and deduce private information about users from shared gradients, federated learning is vulnerable to numerous security and privacy threats. In this work, a communication-efficient protocol for secure aggregation of model parameters in a federated learning setting is proposed where training is done on user devices while the aggregated trained model could be constructed on the server side without revealing the raw data of users. The proposed protocol is robust against users’ dropouts, and it enables each user to independently validate the aggregated result supplied by the server. The suggested protocol is secure in an honest-but-curious environment, and privacy is maintained even if the majority of parties are in collusion. A practical scenario for the proposed setting is discussed. Additionally, a simulation of the protocol is evaluated, and results demonstrate that it outperforms one of the state-of-art protocols, especially when the number of dropouts increases.}

	abstract = {The ubiquity and pervasiveness of modern Internet of Things (IoT) devices opens up vast possibilities for novel applications, but simultaneously also allows spying on, and collecting data from, unsuspecting users to a previously unseen extent. This paper details a new attack form in this vein, in which the decay properties of widespread, off-the-shelf DRAM modules are exploited to accurately spy on the temperature in the vicinity of the DRAM-carrying device. Among others, this enables adversaries to remotely and purely digitally spy on personal behavior in users’ private homes, or to collect security-critical data in server farms, cloud storage centers, or commercial production lines. We demonstrate that our attack can be performed by merely compromising the software of an IoT device and does not require hardware modifications or physical access at attack time. It can achieve temperature resolutions of up to\n0.5\n∘\nC\nover a range of\n0\n∘\nC\nto\n70\n∘\nC\nin practice. The presented attack works in devices that do not have a dedicated temperature sensor on board; as the DRAM modules already present in the device are abused to spy on the temperature. To complete the work, the paper discusses practical attack scenarios as well as possible countermeasures against the new temperature-spying attacks.}

	abstract = {Microarchitectural attacks have become increasingly threatening the society with diverse set of attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. Vendor patches cannot keep up with the pace of the new threats, which makes the dynamic anomaly detection tools more evident than before. Unfortunately, hardware performance counters (HPCs) utilized in previous works can detect a few microarchitectural attacks due to the small number of counters that can be profiled concurrently while introducing high performance overhead. These challenges consequently yield to inefficient detection tools in real-world security-critical systems. In this study, we introduce MAD-EN dynamic detection tool that leverages system-wide energy consumption traces collected from a generic Intel RAPL tool to detect ongoing anomalies in two different microarchitectures, namely Intel Comet Lake and Intel Tiger Lake. In the first phase of MAD-EN , we can distinguish 16 variants from 11 different micro-architectural attacks from benign applications by utilizing a binary-class CNN-based model with an F1 score of 0.998, which makes our tool the most generic attack detection tool so far. In the second phase, MAD-EN can recognize the respective attack types with a 95% accuracy by utilizing a multi-class CNN-based classification technique after the anomaly is detected. We demonstrate that MAD-EN introduces 69.3% less performance overhead compared to performance counter-based detection mechanisms, allowing more feasible real-time detection tool for generic purpose systems.}

	abstract = {Recently deep-learning (DL) techniques have been widely adopted in side-channel power analysis. A DL-assisted SCA generally consists of two phases: a deep neural network (DNN) training phase and a follow-on attack phase using the trained DNN. However, currently the two phases are not well aligned, as there is no conclusion on what metric used in the training can result in the most effective attack in the second phase. When traditional loss functions such as negative log-likelihood (NLL) are used in training a DNN, the trained model does not yield optimal follow-on attack. Recently some information theoretical SCA leakage metrics are proposed, either as the validation metric to stop the DNN training with traditional loss functions, or as both the validation metric and the training loss function. None of those proposed metrics, however, directly measures the SCA effectiveness. We propose to conduct DNN training directly with a common SCA effectiveness metric, Guessing Entropy (GE). We overcome the prior practical difficulty of using GE in DNN training by utilizing the GEEA estimation algorithm introduced in CHES 2020. We show that using GEEA as either the validation metric or the loss function produces DNN models that lead to much more effective follow-on attacks. Our work consolidates the DL-assisted SCA framework with a consistent metric, which shows great potential to be adopted as the universal SCA-oriented DNN training framework.}

	abstract = {In batch steganography, the sender distributes the secret payload among multiple images from a “bag” to decrease the chance of being caught. Recent work on this topic described an experimentally discovered phenomenon, which we call the “bag gain”: for fixed communication rate, pooled detectors experience a decrease in statistical detectability for initially increasing bag sizes, providing an opportunity for the sender to gain in security. The bag gain phenomenon is universal in the sense of manifesting under a wide spectrum of conditions. In this paper, we explain this experimental observation by adopting a statistical model of detector response. Despite the simplicity of the model, it does capture observed trends in detectability as a function of the bag size, the rate, and cover source properties. Additionally, and surprisingly, the model predicts that in certain cover sources the sender should avoid bag sizes that are too small as this can lead to a bag loss.}

	abstract = {RGB-Infrared person re-identification (RGB-IR ReID) aims to associate people across disjoint RGB and IR camera views. Currently, state-of-the-art performance of RGB-IR ReID is not as impressive as that of conventional ReID. Much of that is due to the notorious modality bias training issue brought by the single-modality ImageNet pre-training, which might yield RGB-biased representations that severely hinder the cross-modality image retrieval. This paper makes first attempt to tackle the task from a pre-training perspective. We propose a self-supervised pre-training solution, named Modality-Aware Multiple Granularity Learning (MMGL), which directly trains models from scratch only on multi-modal ReID datasets, but achieving competitive results against ImageNet pre-training, without using any external data or sophisticated tuning tricks. First, we develop a simple-but-effective 'permutation recovery' pretext task that globally maps shuffled RGB-IR images into a shared latent permutation space, providing modality-invariant global representations for downstream ReID tasks. Second, we present a part-aware cycle-contrastive (PCC) learning strategy that utilizes cross-modality cycle-consistency to maximize agreement between semantically similar RGB-IR image patches. This enables contrastive learning for the unpaired multi-modal scenarios, further improving the discriminability of local features without laborious instance augmentation. Based on these designs, MMGL effectively alleviates the modality bias training problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it learns better representations (+8.03% Rank-1 accuracy) with faster training speed (converge only in few hours) and higher data efficiency (< 5% data size) than ImageNet pre-training. The results also suggest it generalizes well to various existing models, losses and has promising transferability across datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/hansonchen1996/MMGL .}

To this end, we designed efficient cryptographic protocols that are secure in the semi-honest setting as well as the malicious setting. By incorporating differential privacy, we further improve the efficiency by\n1.1×\nto\n73.1×\n.

	abstract = {The tremendous progress in deep learning has enabled to extract soft-biometric attributes from faces, which raises privacy concerns over images collected for face recognition. Advances toward attribute privacy have been able to conceal multiple attributes while preserving identity information but suffer from limitations: they 1) only consider a few soft-biometric attributes and 2) fail to support reversibility for attribute privacy preservation. To break these limitations, we design a reversible privacy-preserving scheme for various face attributes, called reversible attribute privacy preservation (RAPP). RAPP benefits from two modules: 1) The attribute obfuscator introduces a stream cipher to determine that special attributes have to be concealed with the user-defined password, which also supports recovering original attributes. 2) The attribute adversarial network is proposed to generate perturbed images that conceal various attributes while retaining the utility of face verification. In addition, when a wrong password is provided, the returned image with wrong attribute classification results still keeps realistic, which confuses an attacker to know whether the recovery is correct. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPP enables to conceal various attributes and recover original images while facilitating face verification.}

	abstract = {Split learning (SL) enables data privacy preservation by allowing clients to collaboratively train a deep learning model with the server without sharing raw data. However, SL still has limitations such as potential data privacy leakage and high computation for clients. In this paper, we propose to binarize the SL local layers for faster computation (up to 17.5 times less forward-propagation time in both training and inference phases on mobile devices) and reduced memory usage (up to 32 times less memory and bandwidth requirements). More importantly, the binarized SL (B-SL) model can reduce privacy leakage from SL smashed data with merely a small degradation in model accuracy. To further enhance privacy preservation, we also propose two novel approaches: 1) training with additional local leak loss and 2) applying differential privacy, which could be integrated separately or concurrently into the B-SL model. Experimental results with different datasets have affirmed the benefits of the B-SL models compared with several benchmark models. The effectiveness of B-SL models against feature-space hijacking attack (FSHA) is also illustrated. Our results have demonstrated B-SL models are promising for lightweight IoT/mobile applications with high privacy-preservation requirements such as mobile healthcare applications.}

	abstract = {Biometric cryptosystems present a promising avenue for secure authentication; however, the efficiency and security of such systems can be hindered by errors in biometric data. To address this challenge, existing systems employ error-correction codes, but often fail to consider the distribution of biometric sources, potentially leading to an underestimation of the system’s security. In response to this issue, we propose a novel algorithm pair, designated as\nENCODE\nand\nDECODE\n, which facilitates direct codeword generation from biometric samples. Our approach accounts for the distribution of biometric sources, thereby providing a more accurate estimation of system security compared to traditional methods. Our proposed algorithm pair generates codewords that maintain interpretability and are sensitive to the cosine distance between original biometric samples. This similarity metric is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional data analysis and enables a precise assessment of system performance. We have rigorously established the correctness of our algorithm pair, and empirical results illustrate its efficacy in tolerating distance between codewords while preserving accuracy in cosine distance-sensitive contexts. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and security of biometric cryptosystems, rendering them more appropriate for daily cryptographic applications.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a fundamental problem regarding the security of blockchain PoW consensus on how the existence of multiple misbehaving miners influences the profitability of selfish mining. Each selfish miner maintains a private chain and makes it public opportunistically for acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hash power. We first establish a general Markov chain model to characterize the state transition of public and private chains for Basic Selfish Mining (BSM), and derive the stationary profitable threshold of Hash power in closed form. It reduces from 25% for a single attacker to below 21.48% for two symmetric attackers theoretically, and further reduces to around 10% with eight symmetric attackers experimentally. We next explore the profitable threshold when one of the attackers performs strategic mining based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that only half of the attributes pertinent to a mining state are observable to him. An online algorithm is presented to compute the nearly optimal policy efficiently despite the large state space and high dimensional belief space. The profitable threshold is much lower for the strategic attacker. Last, we formulate a simple model of absolute mining revenue that yields an interesting observation: selfish mining is never profitable at the first difficulty adjustment period, but relies on the reimbursement of stationary selfish mining gains in future periods. The delay till being profitable of an attacker increases with the decrease of his Hash power, making blockchain miners more cautious about performing selfish mining.}

However, the ‘plain vanilla’ pay-as-you-go strategy may not be suitable for non-regular users since the latter group is likely to require a tighter identity supervision mechanism. We also note that a key building block in the construction of an anonymous credential system is identity supervision. Since identity supervision is more than revocation, the approach to regulating user behavior needs to be both reasonable and practical. In a situation where the user is allowed to control their own identities, the latter approach could be more flexible compared to the revocation. There are existing works about the limitation on the k-times or epochs. However, due to the weaknesses of these single restrictions, the combination of the customized k-times and epochs is necessary and remains to be done. In this paper, we present a permissioned redactable credentials scheme, which allows fine-grained supervision, user control, and user redaction. In our approach, we choose times and epochs as the regulation dimensions, which limits users invoke the credential show method for customized times in each epoch determined by the certificate authority. The users could also redact their credentials to realize selective disclosure. We then evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance and present a comparative summary to demonstrate potential utility.}

The scarcity and strong resource competitiveness of TCAM space put the flow tables at the risk of malicious Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose LtRFT, a Learning-To-Rank (LtR) based scheme for mitigating the low-rate DDoS attacks targeted at flow tables. LtRFT consists of three modules: monitor, ranker, and mitigator. Monitor manages the flow table status and sends alerts to other modules after detecting attacks. Ranker models the attack mitigation problem as a flow entry ranking task, and ranks malicious flows with a high eviction priority using a pairwise-based LtR algorithm. The mitigator frees up the flow table space by deleting malicious flow entries according to the flow entry ranking sequence generated by ranker. We introduce LtR to network attack detection innovatively and use both classification and information retrieval metrics to describe and evaluate LtRFT. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of LtRFT in detecting and mitigating the low-rate data plane DDoS attacks. LtRFT can detect malicious attack flows with an accuracy of over 96%, and can reduce the attack flow duration by 97.7% with an average extra latency of 0.5 seconds, which proves that LtRFT is practicable in SDN deployments.}

However, the direct applications of most existing SE schemes in cloud-assisted EHRs may result in challenges, for example in terms of functionality, security and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BPVSE, a new verifiable and dynamic SE scheme for cloud-assisted EHR. BPVSE has the following advantages over existing approaches. First, leveraging blockchain and hash-proof chain, BPVSE allows the user to publicly verify the search result returned by the cloud without a trusted authority. Second, BPVSE supports dynamic datasets with forward and backward security, using our newly designed new hidden data structure. Third, BPVSE enables the user to launch parallel search with efficient encryption. We formally prove the security of the proposed BPVSE, and also conduct theoretical comparison and experimental evaluation to show its superiority of functionality, security, and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial images. Conventional attacks strive for indistinguishable adversarial images with strictly restricted perturbations. Recently, researchers have moved to explore distinguishable yet non-suspicious adversarial images and demonstrated that color transformation attacks are effective. In this work, we propose Adversarial Color Filter (AdvCF), a novel color transformation attack that is optimized with gradient information in the parameter space of a simple color filter. In particular, our color filter space is explicitly specified so that we are able to provide a systematic analysis of model robustness against adversarial color transformations, from both the attack and defense perspectives. In contrast, existing color transformation attacks do not offer the opportunity for systematic analysis due to the lack of such an explicit space. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our AdvCF in fooling image classifiers and also compare it with other color transformation attacks regarding their robustness to defenses and image acceptability through an extensive user study. We also highlight the human-interpretability of AdvCF and show its superiority over the state-of-the-art human-interpretable color transformation attack on both image acceptability and efficiency. Additional results provide interesting new insights into model robustness against AdvCF in another three visual tasks.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel physical layer security scheme that exploits an optimization method as a one-way function. The proposed scheme builds on nonsquare differential multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), which is capable of noncoherent detection even in massive MIMO scenarios and thus resilient against risky pilot insertion and pilot contamination attacks. In contrast to conventional nonsquare differential MIMO schemes, which require space-time projection matrices designed via highly complex, discrete, and combinatorial optimization, the proposed scheme utilizes projection matrices constructed via low-complexity continuous optimization designed to maximize the coding gain of the system. Furthermore, using a secret key generated from the true randomness nature of the wireless channel as an initial value, the proposed continuous optimization-based projection matrix construction method becomes a one-way function, making the proposed scheme a physical layer secure differential MIMO system. An attack algorithm to challenge the proposed scheme is also devised, which demonstrates that the security level achieved improves as the number of transmit antennas increases, even in an environment where the eavesdropper can perfectly estimate channel coefficients and experience asymptotically large signal-to-noise ratios.}

	abstract = {Recently, various wireless Internet-of-Things devices and unmanned aerial vehicles have been frequently used to facilitate daily life. On the other hand, they can also pose serious threats to public security if maliciously used. A countermeasure against these threats is to transmit jamming signals to break the communication links between attacker and wireless devices. However, this is not easy since modern multi-device (multi-user) wireless communication systems are smart in avoiding jamming. Moreover, a relay is widely used to improve the jamming resistance. To successfully jam those malicious devices, we consider a jamming and anti-jamming zero-sum game, in which the attacker tries to maximize the sum-rate of a relay-assisted wireless system and the jammer tries to minimize it. Finding the equilibrium is challenging due to its non-convexity and complex structure. We address this problem in two cases. Specifically, in the single-device (single-user) case, we show that putting the whole jamming power to either relay or device achieves the Nash equilibrium. In the multi-device case, an efficient method is developed, which transforms this game into a min-max optimization problem and decouples it into two sub-problems by the hybrid block successive approximation method. The resultant sub-problems are solved by the multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers and the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers, respectively. Then, a stationary point of the original problem can be iteratively achieved. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed jamming methods outperform many traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have made it simple to manipulate a variety of media, including satellite images. Most of the commercially available satellite images go through the process of orthorectification to remove potential distortions due to terrain variations. This orthorectification process typically involves the use of rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) that geometrically remap the pixels in the original image to the rectified image. This paper proposes the first method to verify the authenticity of RPC metadata in an orthorectified satellite image. The steps include calculating the Residual Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) pattern from the image using a linear predictor based residual spectral analysis and comparing with Expected Residual pattern that is obtained using the RPC metadata associated with the image. If the metadata associated with orthorectified image is correct, then the Residual-DFT pattern (which represents image data) and the Expected-Residual-DFT pattern (which represents metadata) should be similar. We use SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Metric) to quantify the similarity and thereby verify if the data has been tampered or not. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves over 97% accuracy in the majority of binary tampering detection tests.}

	abstract = {Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID), including fully unsupervised ReID and unsupervised domain adaptive ReID, remains a challenge for the fields of biometrics and computer vision due to its difficulty in learning with unlabeled target domain data. Existing state-of-the-art methods, most of which generate pseudo-labels via unsupervised clustering for model optimization, are inevitably hampered by the under-explored problem of pseudo-label noise. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint framework termed pseudo-label Noise Prevention, Suppression, and Softening (NPSS) for unsupervised person re-identification. Instead of refining generated label noise after clustering as many existing methods do, we start solving this issue from the source of pseudo-label noise by proposing a new Dynamic Camera-Adaptive Clustering (DCAC), which dynamically involves camera information to prevent noise caused by cross-camera variance, thus improving their quality during clustering. Moreover, we propose an Online Domain Union (ODU) mechanism for the classification model learning on the target domain via involving source domain data with their ground-truth labels, which effectively suppresses the indelible noisy pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we present the Self-Consistency Constraint (SCC) to soften the label noise in a single model with reduced computation and network parameter cost, which achieves intra-sample knowledge ensembling with our global-local SCC and cross-sample knowledge ensembling with our inter-instance SCC. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as it surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and MSMT17 benchmarks.

	abstract = {Research in presentation attack detection (PAD) for iris recognition has largely moved beyond evaluation in “closed-set” scenarios, to emphasize ability to generalize to presentation attack types not present in the training data. This paper offers multiple contributions to understand and extend the state-of-the-art in open-set iris PAD. First, it describes the most authoritative evaluation to date of iris PAD. We have curated the largest publicly-available image dataset for this problem, drawing from 26 benchmarks previously released by various groups, and adding 150,000 images being released with this paper, to create a set of 450,000 images representing authentic iris and seven types of presentation attack instrument (PAI). We formulate a leave-one-PAI-out evaluation protocol, and show that even the best algorithms in the closed-set evaluations exhibit catastrophic failures on multiple attack types in the open-set scenario. This includes algorithms performing well in the most recent LivDet-Iris 2020 competition, which may come from the fact that the LivDet-Iris protocol emphasizes sequestered images rather than unseen attack types. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of five open-source iris presentation attack algorithms available today, one of which is newly-proposed in this paper, and build an ensemble method that beats the winner of the LivDet-Iris 2020 by a substantial margin. This paper demonstrates that closed-set iris PAD, when all PAIs are known during training, is a solved problem, with multiple algorithms showing very high accuracy, while open-set iris PAD, when evaluated correctly, is far from being solved. The newly-created dataset, new open-source algorithms, and evaluation protocol, all made publicly available with this paper, provide experimental artifacts that researchers can use to measure progress on this important problem.}

	abstract = {Physical layer key generation (PLKG) is a promising technique to establish symmetric keys between resource-constrained legitimate users. However, PLKG suffers from a low key rate in harsh environments where channel randomness is limited. To address the problem, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are introduced to reshape the channels by controlling massive reflecting elements, which can provide more channel diversity. In this paper, we design a channel probing protocol to fully extract the randomness from the cascaded channel, i.e., the channels through reflecting elements. We derive the analytical expressions of the key rate and design a water-filling algorithm based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the upper bound. To find the optimal precoding and phase shift matrices, we propose an algorithm based on the Grassmann manifold optimization methods. The system is evaluated in terms of the key rate, bit disagreement rate (BDR) and randomness. Simulation results show that our protocols significantly improve the key rate as compared to existing protocols. Compared to multiple-antennas systems without a RIS, our proposed method achieves an average 9.51 dB performance gain when the side length of an element is 1/4 wavelength and the Rician factor is 0 dB.}

	abstract = {3D perception of objects is critical for many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and robots. Among them, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D perception systems are based on deep learning models. Recently, the research community found that 3D object classifiers on point cloud based on deep learning are easily fooled by adversarial point cloud craft by attackers. To overcome this, adversarial defenses are considered the most effective ways to improve the robustness of deep learning models, and most adversarial defenses on point cloud are focused on input transformation. However, all previous defense methods decrease the natural accuracy, and the nature of the point cloud classifiers itself has been overlooked. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial defense for 3D point cloud classifiers that makes full use of the nature of the point cloud classifiers. Due to the disorder of point cloud, all point cloud classifiers have the property of permutation invariant to the input point cloud. Based on this nature, we design invariant transformations defense (IT-Defense). We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, our IT-Defense is a resilient defense against SOTA 3D attacks. Moreover, IT-Defense does not hurt clean accuracy compared to previous SOTA 3D defenses. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/cuge1995/ IT-Defense.}

	abstract = {Essential services in an Internet of Things (IoT)-based critical system should be continuously provided even when undesirable events like failures, attacks, and emergencies happen. In this work, we analyze the system’s ability to survive failures that are caused by resource exhaustion attacks. Such ability to survive means that the system’s services should be provided in compliance with the associated requirements also in presence of failures and other undesired events. Accordingly, we present a hybrid method (i.e., measurements- and model-based) to assess the expected survivability of an IoT system under resource-exhaustion attacks and, based on it, to optimize the preventive maintenance trigger period that maximizes survivability and minimizes the expected downtime cost. A realistic case study is implemented to emulate an IoT scenario and used to estimate the extent of resource consumption at each layer of the IoT stack when the system is subject to a resource-exhaustion attack. A semi-Markov process is then adopted to model the transient behavior of the system during an intrusion. The model is enriched with an additional state that represents a proactive recovery, in which the system is not available for a maintenance action aimed at preventing failure. The model solution gives the optimal maintenance triggering time.}

	abstract = {For model privacy, local model parameters in federated learning shall be obfuscated before sent to the remote aggregator. This technique is referred to as secure aggregation . However, secure aggregation makes model poisoning attacks such as backdooring more convenient given that existing anomaly detection methods mostly require access to plaintext local models. This paper proposes a new federated learning technique SAFELearning to support backdoor detection for secure aggregation. We achieve this through two new primitives - oblivious random grouping (ORG) and partial parameter disclosure (PPD) . ORG partitions participants into one-time random subgroups with group configurations oblivious to participants; PPD allows secure partial disclosure of aggregated subgroup models for anomaly detection without leaking individual model privacy. ORG is based on our construction of several new primitives including tree-based random subgroup generation, oblivious secure aggregation, and randomized Diffie-Hellman key exchange. ORG can thwart colluding attackers from knowing each other’s group membership assignment with non-negligible advantage than random guess. Backdoor attacks are detected based on statistical distributions of the subgroup aggregated parameters of the learning iterations. SAFELearning can significantly reduce backdoor model accuracy without jeopardizing the main task accuracy under common backdoor strategies. Extensive experiments show SAFELearning is robust against malicious and faulty participants, whilst being more efficient than the state-of-art secure aggregation protocol in terms of both communication and computation costs.}

	abstract = {The min-entropy is a widely used metric to quantify the randomness of generated random numbers, which measures the difficulty of guessing the most likely output. It is difficult to accurately estimate the min-entropy of a non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) source. Hence, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90B adopts ten different min-entropy estimators and then conservatively selects the minimum value among these ten min-entropy estimates. Among these estimators, the longest repeated substring (LRS) estimator estimates the collision entropy instead of the min-entropy by counting the number of repeated substrings. Since the collision entropy is an upper bound on the min-entropy, the LRS estimator inherently provides overestimated outputs. In this paper, we propose two techniques to estimate the min-entropy of a non-IID source accurately. The first technique resolves the overestimation problem by translating the collision entropy into the min-entropy. Next, we generalize the LRS estimator by adopting the general Rényi entropy instead of the collision entropy (i.e., Rényi entropy of order two). We show that adopting a higher order can reduce the variance of min-entropy estimates. By integrating these techniques, we propose a generalized LRS estimator that effectively resolves the overestimation problem and provides stable min-entropy estimates. Theoretical analysis and empirical results support that the proposed generalized LRS estimator improves the estimation accuracy significantly, which makes it an appealing alternative to the LRS estimator.}

	abstract = {With the growing use of underwater acoustic communications and the recent adoption of standards in this field, it is becoming increasingly important to secure messages against eavesdroppers. In this paper, we focus on a physical-layer security solution to generate sequences of random bits (keys) between two devices (Alice and Bob) belonging to an underwater acoustic network (UWAN); the key must remain secret to a passive eavesdropper (Eve) not belonging to the UWAN. Our method is based on measuring the propagation delay of the underwater acoustic channel over multiple hops of the UWAN: this harvests the randomness in the UWAN topology and turns the slow sound propagation in water into an advantage against eavesdropping. Our key generation protocol includes a route discovery handshake, whereby all UWAN devices at intermediate hops accumulate their message processing delays. This enables Alice and Bob to compute the actual propagation delays along each route and to map such information to a sequence of bits. Finally, from these bit sequences, Alice and Bob obtain a secret key. We analyze the performance of the protocol theoretically and assess it via extensive simulations and field experiments.}

	abstract = {The number of images produced by people everyday is rapidly increasing in recent years and their local storage space may be not big enough for storing all these images. As a result, people are currently accustomed to uploading images to cloud platforms, which raises privacy concerns. Traditional image encryption is a way to protect image privacy without preserving visual usability, so that image owners fail to conveniently browse and manage their images stored in the cloud. Hence some visual privacy protection schemes were proposed to balance image privacy and usability, while many of them are irreversible. Recently, a novel reversible technology, called Thumbnail-Preserving Encryption (TPE), has been a hot topic. However, existing TPE schemes are either inefficient, or cannot perfectly restore the original image and meanwhile achieve Nonce-Respecting (NR) security. In view of this, we propose a reversible framework for efficient and secure visual privacy protection, which tunably preserves image visual usability for image owners with the idea of data hiding. In the framework, the original image is firstly divided into several regions by our proposed region division methods and one of the regions is vacated by data hiding. Then, the vacated region is utilized to preserve the original thumbnail by pixel adjustment after image encryption. Finally, pixels in each sub block are permuted for security. According to our theoretical analysis, the above processes are completely reversible and the processed image achieves NR security. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments, including recognition by various application programming interfaces, user surveys, and efficiency comparison, to demonstrate that our framework is efficient and strikes a good balance between privacy and usability.}

	abstract = {The function or performance of a network is strongly dependent on its robustness, which quantifies the ability of the network to continue functioning under perturbations. While a wide variety of robustness metrics have been proposed, they have their respective limitations. In this paper, we propose to use the forest index as a measure of network robustness, which overcomes the deficiencies of existing metrics. Using such a measure as an optimization criterion, we propose and study the problem of breaking down a network by attacking some key edges. We show that the objective function of the problem is monotonic but not submodular, which impose more challenging on the problem. We thus resort to greedy algorithms extended for non-submodular functions by iteratively deleting the most promising edges. We first propose a simple greedy algorithm with a proved bound for the approximation ratio and cubic-time complexity. To confront the computation challenge for large networks, we further propose an improved nearly-linear time greedy algorithm, which significantly speeds up the process for edge selection but sacrifices little accuracy. Extensive experimental results for a large set of real-world networks verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, demonstrating that our algorithms outperform several baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Network Virtualization (NV) is an emerging network dynamic planning technique to overcome network rigidity. As its necessary challenge, Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) enhances the scalability and flexibility of the network by decoupling the resources and services of the underlying physical network. For future multi-domain physical network modeling with the characteristics of dynamics, heterogeneity, privacy, and real-time, the existing related works perform unsatisfactorily. Federated learning (FL) jointly optimizes the network by sharing parameters among multiple parties and is widely used to address data privacy and data silos. Aiming at the NV challenge of multi-domain physical networks, this work is the first to propose using FL to model VNE, and presents a VNE architecture based on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) (HFL-VNE). Specifically, combined with the distributed training paradigm of FL, we deploy local servers in each physical domain, which can effectively focus on local features and reduce resource fragmentation. A global server is deployed to aggregate and share training parameters, which enhances local data privacy and significantly improves learning efficiency. Furthermore, we deploy the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model in each server to dynamically adjust and optimize the resource allocation of the multi-domain physical network. In DRL-assisted FL, HFL-VNE jointly optimizes decision-making through specific local and federated reward mechanisms and loss functions. Finally, the superiority of HFL-VNE is proved by combining simulation experiments and comparing it with related works.}

	abstract = {Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) constitute the functioning basis of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and hence are often a focal point for attackers to exploit. Previous attacks have seen PLC memory maliciously altered in order to disrupt the underlying physical process. Different types of memory attack can cause a similar impact on the PLC’s operation and result in indistinguishable physical manifestations. Consequently, delays in triaging attacks through digital forensic practices can induce significant financial loss, physical damage to the infrastructure, and degradation of safety. In this work, we propose PLCPrint, a novel vendor-independent fingerprinting approach that utilises PLC memory artefacts to perform detection and classification of memory attacks. PLCPrint uses PLC memory register mapping, a novel method exploiting the relationship between PLC registers and memory artefacts including the PLC application code. Through this, registers are assigned a Mapping Condition (MC) to indicate how they exist within the PLC memory artefacts. We evaluate the performance of PLCPrint over realistic emulations conducted at a real testbed emulating water filtration and distribution. Through PLCPrint we depict how MC deviations are utilised within supervised learning schemes such as to adequately classify PLC memory attacks with high accuracy performance. In general, we demonstrate that PLCPrint fills the gap in the context of attack technique triaging since this has been a missing element within current ICS forensics schemes.}

	abstract = {With the widespread use of face masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate masked face recognition has become more crucial than ever. While several studies have investigated masked face recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is a paucity of research exploring the use of plain Vision Transformers (ViTs) for this task. Unlike ViT models used in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, the model trained by modern face recognition losses struggles to converge when trained from scratch. To this end, this paper initializes the model parameters via a proxy task of patch reconstruction and observes that the ViT backbone exhibits improved training stability with satisfactory performance for face recognition. Beyond the training stability, two strategies based on prompts are proposed to integrate holistic and masked face recognition in a single framework, namely FaceT. Along with popular holistic face recognition benchmarks, several open-sourced masked face recognition benchmarks are collected for evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FaceT performs on par or better than state-of-the-art CNNs on both holistic and masked face recognition benchmarks. Codes will be made available at https://github.com/zyainfal/Joint-Holistic-and-Masked-Face-Recognition .}

	abstract = {With the emergence of countless independent blockchain systems in recent years, cross-chain transactions have attracted considerable attention, and lots of solutions have been put forth by both industry and academia. However, most of the existing solutions suffer from either centralization or scalability issues. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose the concept of cross-chain virtual payment channels, which allows two users in different blockchain systems to conduct limitless off-chain transactions with the help of an intermediate node, hence solving the centralization and scalability issues. Furthermore, as the intermediate node is only involved in the channel open and close operations, it further improves the efficiency of cross-chain transactions, and to a certain extent, it even enhances the privacy of the cross-chain transaction. Meanwhile, we also present the first concrete cross-chain virtual payment channel scheme, which only requires one of the blockchain systems supporting the Turing-complete scripting language. The corresponding detailed security analysis in the Universal Composability framework demonstrates that our proposal holds the Consensus on Open, Update, and Close. Finally, we implement and deploy our cross-chain virtual payment channel scheme on the Ethereum and Bitcoin test networks. The extensive experimental results show that our proposal dramatically improves the efficiency of cross-chain transactions, and the advantage becomes more pronounced as the number of transactions increases.}

	abstract = {Location-based services (LBSs) provide enhanced functionality of mobile applications and convenience for mobile users, which plays a more and more remarkable role in people’s daily life. In LBSs, spatial range query is an essential tool for users to find interesting points in a specific region. However, during spatial range query, it is necessary for data owners and query users to exchange their location data, and the leakage of private location information has drawn significant attention in both governmental and social aspects. Meanwhile, most existing location privacy protection schemes only focus on achieving regular geometry range query over static location datasets. In this paper, we present an efficient and privacy-preserving arbitrary polygon range query scheme, named EPAPRQ. With EPAPRQ, the arbitrary and fine-grained polygon range query can be executed over a dynamic and time-series location dataset with privacy protection. Specifically, in EPAPRQ, an arbitrary polygon range query algorithm is first introduced with sub-range query technique. Then, to protect the private location information of the data owner and query users, a series privacy-preserving data computation protocols are constructed with a symmetric homomorphic encryption algorithm, and a ciphertext-based location dataset updating strategy is also designed. Finally, we propose a double filtration method through combining the quadtree index structure and minimum bounded rectangle, which is able to greatly improve the query efficiency over ciphertexts. Detailed security analysis shows that the sensitive location information in EPAPRQ can be well protected. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of EPAPRQ in the real map, and the results demonstrate that EPAPRQ is indeed efficient.}

To protect data privacy, many privacy-preserving FL approaches have been designed and implemented in various scenarios. However, existing works incur high communication burdens on clients, and affect the training model accuracy due to non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data samples separately owned by clients. To solve these issues, in this paper we propose a secure Model-Contrastive Federated Learning with improved Compressive Sensing (MCFL-CS) scheme, motivated by contrastive learning. We combine model-contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss to design the local network architecture of our scheme, which can alleviate the impact of data heterogeneity on model accuracy. Then we utilize improved compressive sensing and local differential privacy to reduce communication costs and prevent clients’ privacy leakage. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme satisfies\n(ε,δ)\n-differential privacy. And extensive experiments using five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our scheme improves the model accuracy by 3.45% on average of all datasets under the non-IID setting and reduces the communication costs by more than 95%, when compared with FedAvg.}

We consider a general adversary model where attackers jointly exploit the vulnerability of IoT devices and that of the blockchain employed in the BIoT. The optimal attacking strategy which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence is pursued. It can be shown that this optimization problem is nonconvex, and hence it is generally intractable to find the globally optimal solution to such a problem. To overcome this issue, we first propose a relaxation method that can convert the original nonconvex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem, and then the analytic expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed convex optimization problem is derived. The optimal value of the relaxed convex optimization problem provides a detection performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks. In addition, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm which is based on a capped water-filling method to solve the relaxed convex optimization problem, and moreover, we show that the convergence of the proposed coordinate descent algorithm can be guaranteed.}

	abstract = {Anti-spoofing ability is vital for fingerprint identification systems. Conventional fingerprint scanning devices can only obtain information from the fingertip surfaces, and their performance is susceptible to skin conditions and presentation attacks (PAs). However, optical coherence tomography (OCT) can scan subcutaneous tissue and obtain 3D fingerprint structures, naturally enhancing its PA detection (PAD) ability from the perspective of hardware. Existing unsupervised PAD methods are based on image reconstruction. However, the reconstruction error is easily affected by OCT noise and the rich details of OCT images. Therefore we propose feature-based reconstruction to alleviate this problem, called the prototype-guided autoencoder. The model consists of a memory module and a denoising autoencoder without the requirement of PA fingerprints. As only bona fide fingerprints are available during the training phase, the memory module contains the prototype features of the bona fide fingerprints. During the inference phase, as the prototype memory module is frozen, the reconstructed representation of the bona fide input is close to the bona fide fingerprint features. Calculating the distance between the original features and the prototype reconstructed representation of the sample can achieve PAD. To obtain a better decision making boundary, we propose a representation consistency constraint, which reduces the bona fide representation reconstruction distance closer, so that it is easier to differentiate between fingerprints and PAs.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of machine learning, the cloud server has been employed to collect massive data and train machine learning models. Several privacy-preserving machine learning schemes have been suggested recently to guarantee data and model privacy in the cloud. However, these schemes either mandate the involvement of the data owner in model training or utilize high-cost cryptographic techniques, resulting in excessive computational and communication overheads. Furthermore, none of the existing work considers the malicious behavior of the cloud server during model training. In this paper, we propose the first privacy-preserving and verifiable support vector machine training scheme by employing a two-cloud platform. Specifically, based on the homomorphic verification tag, we design a verification mechanism to enable verifiable machine learning training. Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency of model training, we combine homomorphic encryption and data perturbation to design an efficient multiplication operation for the encryption domain. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates the security and reliability of our scheme. The experimental results indicate that our scheme can reduce computational and communication overheads by at least 43.94% and 99.58%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SVM training methods.}

Template unlinkability, together with template irreversibility, is an essential requirement to properly guarantee template protection. In fact, it ensures that templates generated from the same trait, but used in different applications, cannot be linked to the same identity. This paper deals with the design of a system satisfying the unlinkability requirement. The robustness of the proposed solution is evaluated by exploiting methods stemming from the theory of stochastic optimization, as well as by using quantitative measures specifically proposed to characterize the unlinkability of biometric protection schemes. A case study using finger-vein biometrics is considered to test the proposed cryptosystem on non-ideal data. The proposed scheme guarantees 128 bits of security with acceptable false recognition rates in real-life conditions. Moreover, we provide guidelines to determine the parameters of the transformations to be applied to real biometric traits so as to ensure proper recognition, security, and unlinkability performance.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threat (APT) as a new type of cyber espionage poses a severe threat to modern organizations. Artificial APT defense, in which an organization engages experienced cybersecurity experts to artificially check if there exist rootkits implanted by APT actors within the organizational internet and, if so, artificially remove the discovered rootkits, is recognized as an indispensable part of APT defense. There are two different ways of artificial APT defenses: continuous artificial defense (CAD), where the defense work is conducted at all time points, and impulsive artificial defense (IAD), where the defense work is conducted at a scheduled sequence of time points. IAD is superior to CAD in terms of the overall service cost. In the context of IAD, we refer to each sequence of service costs as an IAD policy. This paper addresses the problem of developing a cost-effective IAD policy (the IAD problem). First, by introducing an impulsive state evolutionary model for the organizational intranet, the IAD problem is reduced to an optimal impulsive control model (the IAD model). Second, by deriving the optimality system for the IAD model, an iterative algorithm for solving the IAD model (the IAD algorithm) is presented. Next, the convergence and effectiveness of the IAD algorithm are validated through numerical experiments. Finally, the effect of some factors is inspected. To our knowledge, this is the first time IAD is inspected from the perspective of optimal impulsive control theory.}

	abstract = {Additively Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) has been widely used in various applications, such as federated learning, blockchain, and online auctions. Elliptic Curve (EC) based AHE has the advantages of efficient encryption, homomorphic addition, scalar multiplication algorithms, and short ciphertext length. However, EC-based AHE schemes require solving a small exponential Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) when running the decryption algorithm, i.e., recovering the plaintext\nm∈{0,1\n}\nℓ\nfrom\nm∗G\n. Therefore, the decryption of EC-based AHE schemes is inefficient when the plaintext length\nℓ>32\n. This leads to people being more inclined to use RSA-based AHE schemes rather than EC-based ones. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm called\nFastECDLP\nfor solving the small exponential ECDLP at 128-bit security level. We perform a series of deep optimizations from two points: computation and memory overhead. These optimizations ensure efficient decryption when the plaintext length\nℓ\nis as long as possible in practice. Moreover, we also provide a concrete implementation and apply\nFastECDLP\nto some specific applications. Experimental results show that\nFastECDLP\nis far faster than the previous works. For example, the decryption can be done in 0.35 ms with a single thread when\nℓ=40\n, which is about 30 times faster than that of Paillier. Furthermore, we experiment with\nℓ\nfrom 27 to 54, and the existing works generally only consider\nℓ≤32\n. The decryption only requires 1 second with 16 threads when\nℓ=54\n. In the practical applications, we can speed up model training of existing vertical federated learning frameworks by 4 to 14 times. At the same time, the decryption efficiency is accelerated by about 140 times in a blockchain financial system (ESORICS 2021) with the same memory overhead.}

	abstract = {In heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) networks, various communication technologies lead to different transmission ranges of nodes, and they can cooperatively provide seamless communication. Unfortunately, the flexible communication mode offers more chances for malware to invade the IoT devices. To maintain its cyber security, two key issues, i.e. the critical threshold of the onset of malware propagation and the lowest-cost defense strategy after it occurs, need to be addressed. To solve the first challenge, we construct a dynamics model by using the degree-based mean-field theory and point process theory, to study the malware propagation-defense process among heterogeneous IoT devices. We analytically derive the closed-form expression of the critical malware transmission rate which can be used to predict whether the malware can propagate or not. For the latter problem, we investigate the equivalent conditions of degree-related patching strategies in defense effectiveness, which can be used to determine the lowest-cost one more directly. In addition, We compare different transmission ways of malware, and find that the malware infection is hard to avoid under the way of centralized transmission, but the decentralized transmission has a greater risk of large-scale infection. We also explore how the immunization measures and the different communication frequencies affect malware propagation. The results show that it is significant to identify important devices for immunization and infected cluster may form in some cases. Our results offer a theoretical foundation to predict and defense malware propagation in heterogeneous IoT networks.}

	abstract = {With the large bandwidths available in the terahertz regime, directional transmissions can exhibit angular dispersion, i.e., frequency-dependent radiation direction. Unfortunately, angular dispersion introduces new security threats as increased bandwidth necessarily yields a larger signal footprint in the spatial domain and potentially benefits an eavesdropper. This paper is the first study of secure transmission strategies on angularly dispersive links. Based on information theoretic foundations, we propose a transmission strategy that channelizes the wideband transmission in frequency, and performs secure coding across frequency channels. With model-driven evaluations and over-the-air experiments, we show that the proposed method exploits the properties of angular dispersion to realize secure wideband transmissions, despite the increased signal footprint and even for practical irregular beams with side lobes and asymmetry. In contrast, without the proposed cross-channel coding strategy, angularly dispersive links can suffer from significant security degradation when bandwidth increases. In addition, we find that the security degradation due to bandwidth increment for angularly dispersive links is secondary compared to other factors including the selected secrecy rate or the directivity of the link. Nonetheless, we find that a higher angular dispersion level, i.e., a larger angular spread with the same bandwidth, results in a higher security degradation as bandwidth increases.}

	abstract = {Previous works have extensively studied the transferability of adversarial samples in untargeted black-box scenarios. However, it still remains challenging to craft targeted adversarial examples with higher transferability than non-targeted ones. Recent studies reveal that the traditional Cross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted adversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the logit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain saturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this paper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along the optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and effective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the logits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively. Both of them can effectively encourage optimization to produce a larger logit margin and lead to higher transferability. Besides, we show that minimizing the cosine distance between the adversarial examples and the classifier weights of the target class can further improve the transferability, which is benefited from downscaling logits via L2-normalization. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods in black-box targeted attacks.

With an ever-increasing need for always-running logistics and tighter shipping schedules, operators rely more on computerized instruments and their indications. As a result, modern ships have become complex cyber-physical systems in which sensors and computers constantly communicate and coordinate. In this work, we discuss novel threats related to the radar system, one of a ship’s most security-sensitive components. In detail, we first discuss some new attacks capable of compromising the integrity of data displayed on a radar system, with potentially catastrophic impacts on the crew’s situational awareness or safety. Then, we present a detection system to highlight anomalies in the radar video feed, requiring no modifications to the target ship configuration. Finally, we stimulate our detection system by performing the attacks inside a simulated environment. The experimental results indicate that the attacks are feasible, easy to carry out, and hard to detect. Moreover, they prove that the proposed detection technique is effective.}

	abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in modern electronic systems and embedded devices makes their integrity a top security concern. To take advantage of the economies of scale, today’s PCB design and manufacturing are often performed by suppliers around the globe, exposing them to many security vulnerabilities along the segmented PCB supply chain. Moreover, the increasing complexity of the PCB designs also leaves ample room for numerous sneaky board-level attacks to be implemented throughout each stage of a PCB’s lifetime, threatening many electronic devices. In this paper, we propose PDNPulse , a power delivery network (PDN) based PCB anomaly detection framework that can identify a wide spectrum of board-level malicious modifications. PDNPulse leverages the fact that the PDN’s characteristics are inevitably affected by modifications to the PCB. By detecting changes to the PDN impedance profile against the golden model and using the Frechet distance-based anomaly detection algorithms, PDNPulse can robustly and successfully discern malicious modifications across the system. Using PDNPulse, we conduct extensive experiments on seven commercial-off-the-shelf PCBs, covering different design scales, different threat models, and seven different anomaly types. The results confirm that PDNPulse creates an effective security asymmetry between attack and defense.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a joint transmissive and reflective reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) -aided secure multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where both a RIS-assisted transmitter and a RIS-based reflector are deployed to defend against the simultaneous jamming attack and wiretapping threat. Our design focuses on maximizing the sum rate under the unknown jammer’s beamforming, joint RISs’ coupled phase shift errors (PSEs), and spatially-correlated angular channel uncertainties. Besides, we take into account the various quality-of-service (QoS) requirement constraints for guaranteeing the secure performance. Since the problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable, a new optimization framework is established to facilitate the solution development to the formulated problem. Specifically, armed with the Akaike information criterion, a novel diagonalization method is first proposed to estimate the unknown jamming covariance matrix. Then, a series of fractional-eliminated rate expressions is derived that facilitates the application of the proposed Double Deterministic Transformation (DDT) to tackle the coupled stochastic PSEs. Besides, regardless of the spatial correlation matrix, a general discretization method is proposed to convert the e spatially-correlatd angular uncertainties into a worst-case robust one. Subsequently, building upon the above transformations which transform the original problem into tractable one, a two-layer iterative Lagrange multiplier algorithm capitalizing a low-complexity dual method is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution of the digital precoder, where the multiple QoS constraints are handled without iteration. Meanwhile, we develop a novel polyblock-based multiple penalty method to obtain the globally optimal solutions to RISs’ phase shifts which can simultaneously satisfy the multiple QoS constraints. Moreover, to address the narrow feasibility region induced by the multiple QoS constraints, a heuristic initial optimization method is proposed, which strengthens the existing result. Finally, theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the optimality and the excellent performance of our proposed optimization framework.}

This is the case especially in recent times of social distancing and working from home arrangements, where online attendance is the preferred option in contrast to physical presence. In this work, we explore the limitations of mouse dynamics authentication by impersonating legitimate user mouse action sequences. Specifically, towards that aim, we develop a novel generative WC-DCGAN model to generate highly accurate fake user action sequences. We apply our WC-DCGAN to this problem and show that it causes the target classifier can be tricked into identifying a fraudster as a legitimate user. WC-DCGAN has several benefits, including: achieving dominated convergence, hence implying the existence of solutions and optimal discriminator regardless of data and generator distributions; and acting as an unsupervised model for a fixed class label and generator. Experiments are conducted to verify these points. Subsequently, we analyzed the cause of misclassifications, and propose a novel mouse dynamics strategy that offers much tighter authentication with significant reductions in misclassification events.}

	abstract = {Face recognition technology is increasingly being integrated into our daily life, e.g. Face ID. With the advancement of machine learning algorithms, the personal information such as age, gender, and race can be easily deduced from the recorded face images in these applications. This poses a serious privacy threat to individuals who do not want to be profiled, as face images are collected for biometric purposes. Existing methods mostly focus on adding the invisible adversarial perturbations into the images to make automatic inference infeasible. However, the application scenarios of these methods are limited due to the perturbations depending on the specific model. In this paper, we introduce a novel face privacy-enhancing framework by obfuscating the stored faces, which could maintain the data utility (face identity) while protecting the privacy of users (facial attributes). Specifically, we first develop a feature attribution module to discover the identity-related facial parts. Within this module, we introduce a pixel importance estimation model based on Shapley value to obtain a pixel-level attribution map, and then each pixel on the attribution map is aggregated into semantic facial parts, which are used to quantify the importance of different facial parts. Next, we design a privacy-enhancing module to generate the high-quality obfuscated images, which can modify the privacy semantic content and preserve the identity-related information. Using the proposed method, users can choose the single or multiple attributes to be obfuscated without affecting identity matching. Extensive experiments conducted on CelebA-HQ and VGGFace2-HQ benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.}

	abstract = {Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e. , three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.}

	abstract = {Emerging blockchain technology has become the cornerstone of many applications providing trusted data services. However, existing blockchain platforms cannot meet the growing demand for big data storage. Blockchain should duplicate both transactions and other user-defined data across nodes for integrity assurance. The rapid expansion of data on blockchain (on-chain data) increases the difficulty of deploying a full node, resulting in decreasing the degree of decentralization and adding the risk of broken data. To tackle these problems, we propose sChain, a novel framework for improving blockchain storage capacity, which does not revise blockchain implementation and can be applied to almost all the existing blockchain platforms. sChain outsources the user data to storage devices that are structurally external to the blockchain network. In theory, a user can outsource unlimited data to sChain. However, those off-chain data may suffer from corruption. To verify the data integrity, we propose a new provable data possession (PDP) scheme, which does not need a centralized entity to maintain any secret keys and therefore eliminates a single point of failure. What is more, we also design a prototype to accelerate the proposed PDP scheme through Intel SGX technology and parallel processing. Security analysis and evaluation results show that sChain can protect data security and effectively improve the blockchain storage capacity, respectively.}

	abstract = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a technique to identify the unknown emitters by using the hardware impairment of the transmitter. In this paper, we consider the effect of the wireless channel on the SEI, which deteriorates the identification performance severely. Two identifiers are proposed to address the wireless channel effect from the model-based and the data-based perspectives, respectively. From the model-based perspective, the fingerprint extractor using the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is first proposed to jointly estimate the fingerprint parameters, the wireless channel, and the noise power in the multipath fading channels. Then, the classifier using the weighted Euclidean distance is designed to identify the unknown emitter. From the data-based perspective, the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm is adopted to meta-train the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the task collection, which is generated based on the transmitter distortion mechanism and the channel distribution. The trained CNN is fine-tuned on the unseen SEI task and then is used to identify the unknown emitter. Moreover, the Cramer-Rao lower bounds of the estimation of the fingerprint parameters are derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed fingerprint extractor. Numerical results show that the SBL identifier outperforms the MAML one in a small number of samples, while the MAML identifier outperforms the SBL one in a large number of samples. Both identifiers are robust to the wireless channel, obtain better identification performance, and require a small number of samples compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, the simulation results indicate that the mean squared error performance of the SBL fingerprint extractor is close to the performance lower bound.}

	abstract = {We investigate the physical layer security (PLS) in multi-user interference networks. In particular, we consider secure transmission from a legitimate source (Alice) to a legitimate destination (Bob), coexisting with multiple passive eavesdroppers (Eves), as well as multiple legitimate transceivers. By assuming that only statistical channel state informations (CSIs) of Eves and local CSIs of legitimate users are available, we propose an artificial noise (AN) assisted interference alignment (IA) for security enhancement. Unlike traditional IA based security approaches which may result in secret signal cancellation, we design a modified alternating minimization (AM) scheme to overcome this threat, by incorporating the max-eigenmode beamforming (MEB) for secure transmission. Moreover, by partitioning the IA equation into three independent subsets and their combinations, a much tighter necessary condition for IA feasibility is established. We also provide guiding insights into the practical system designs, including useful guidelines for the selection of the dimension of AN. Furthermore, the power allocation ratio between the secret signal and the AN signal is optimized to minimize the secrecy outage probability (SOP), subject to a minimum secrecy rate constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that our design can enhance both quality and security of the secret signal, and thus is suitable and reliable for PLS in interference networks.}

	abstract = {Distributed online social network (DOSN) solves the challenges of single-point failure and user data privacy faced by traditional online social network (OSN). Online discussion group, allowing a user to facilitate the communications with other users, is one of the most important components of (D)OSN. Key management is the key technology to ensure the secure establishment of discussion groups in DOSNs. However, the existing key management schemes for secure discussion group establishment in DOSNs cannot meet the requirements of sender non-restriction, receiver controllability, round optimal, certificate freeness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel key management scheme for secure discussion group establishment in DOSNs. In our scheme, any user could use our key management scheme to initialize a discussion group with a piece of discussion group information. Users who are interested in the group topic contained in the discussion group information can join and leave the discussion group at any time once the discussion group is initialized with one-round communication. Any user/sender can find the users that he/she wants to communicate with by looking up the discussion group information of a discussion group and then send encrypted messages to some or all of the users in the discussion group. Therefore, our scheme achieves sender non-restriction, receiver controllability, round optimal, certificate freeness simultaneously. Security analysis also shows that our scheme achieves confidentiality, authentication, full collusion resistance, known-key security and perfect forward security.}

	abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized platform for e-voting. Among various blockchain-based voting systems, score voting provides flexible choices and better reflects public opinions. However, existing blockchain-based score voting systems suffer from heavy range proof overheads, and are much inefficient compared with other blockchain-based voting systems. Besides, voter anonymity in these systems is not rigorously addressed. In this paper, we propose an efficient, flexible and privacy-preserving score voting system, named ACB-Vote, from anonymously convertible ballots. ACB-Vote achieves voting anonymity with BBS+ signature and signature of knowledge. Driven by convertibly linkable signatures (CLS), ACB-Vote allows cast ballots to be converted, where the conversion mechanism prevents anonymous voters from multiple voting. Besides, the proposed system avoids heavy range proofs, enables batch ballot verification and facilitates flexible tallying methods. We formally define a security model for ACB-Vote and provide rigorous security proofs. Experiments show that the efficiency of ACB-Vote is competitive compared with the previous score voting systems and is affordable in blockchain environments.}

The new method can be used in block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, and sponge constructions. Moreover, we define a new stream cipher mode of operation through a fixed pseudorandom permutation and provide its security proofs in the indistinguishability model. We refer to a stream cipher as a Small Internal State Stream (SISS) cipher if its internal state size is less than twice its key size. There are not many studies about how to design and analyze SISS ciphers due to the criterion on the internal state sizes, resulting from the classical tradeoff attacks. We utilize our new mode and diffusion layer construction to design an SISS cipher having two versions, which we call DIZY. We further provide security analyses and hardware implementations of DIZY. In terms of area cost, power, and energy consumption, the hardware performance is among the best when compared to some prominent stream ciphers, especially for frame-based encryptions that need frequent initialization. Unlike recent SISS ciphers such as Sprout, Plantlet, LILLE, and Fruit; DIZY does not have a keyed update function, enabling efficient key changing.}

In this paper, we make a two-stage error analysis of the commonly used two-level randomness tests in the NIST SP 800–22 test suite. Especially, we give the estimates of the\np\n-value deviations of chi-square approximation in the basic tests based on our proposed continuity constraints, and mathematically express the reliability of uniformity test used in the test suite with the fact of noncentral chi-square approximation. Finally, we analyze the respective error factors and derive the corresponding probability deviation estimation for the tests, explaining some false positive issues in practical test experiments. With our derived error analysis models, one can get a more reliable randomness test strategy with extremely large samples and wider parameter selections.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is essentially a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables the joint training of a global model by aggregating gradients from participating clients without exchanging raw data. However, a malicious aggregation server may deliberately return designed results without any operation to save computation overhead, or even launch privacy inference attacks using crafted gradients. There are only a few schemes focusing on verifiable FL, and yet they cannot achieve collusion-resistant verification. In this paper, we propose a novel V erifiable, C ollusion-resistant, and D ynamic FL (VCD-FL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, we first optimize Lagrange interpolation by gradient grouping and compression for achieving efficient verifiability of FL. To protect clients’ data privacy against collusion attacks, we propose a lightweight commitment scheme using irreversible gradient transformation. By integrating the proposed efficient verification mechanism with the novel commitment scheme, our VCD-FL can detect whether or not the aggregation server is involved in collusion attacks. Moreover, considering that clients might go offline due to some reason such as network anomaly and client crash, we adopt the secret sharing technique to eliminate the effect of federation dynamics on FL. In a nutshell, our VCD-FL can achieve collusion-resistant verification and collusion attack detection with supporting the correctness, privacy, and dynamics. Finally, we theoretically prove the effectiveness of our VCD-FL, make comprehensive comparisons, and conduct a series of experiments on MNIST dataset with MLP and CNN models. The theoretical proof and experimental analysis demonstrate that our VCD-FL is computationally efficient, robust against collusion attacks, and able to support the dynamics of FL.}

Although the fifth-generation (5G) network provides a solution for real-time services in vehicular networks, the security and privacy of the services needs to be addressed first. The existing secure video reporting service schemes in 5G-enabled vehicular networks have significant computing, communication, and storage overheads, because of public key certificates, expensive bilinear pairing operations, and repeated video reporting to the cloud. To address these issues, we propose a secure edge computing-assisted video reporting service in 5G-enabled vehicular networks. In the proposed method, edge nodes complete the message verification and classification. Moreover, these nodes send the first received report message of the same accident to the designated official vehicles to realizes a local upload and download of video reports and to minimize the storage of repeated accident reports in the cloud. Security analysis indicates the proposed scheme is secure under the random oracle model and meets a series of vehicular networks requirements. In addition, performance evaluations show that the scheme achieves lower authentication overhead than existing signature schemes, and has lower total delay than other relevant video reporting service schemes.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been highly praised for its immutability, attracting considerable attention in the academic and industrial community. However, since permanent storage in blockchains would result in copyright disputes and harmful information spreads, it is desired to equip blockchains with mutability nowadays for legal and moral duty restrictions. A redactable blockchain is a variation, which enables the editing of block objects without affecting other blocks in the blockchain. Most existing redactable blockchains can only support editing operations such as modification and deletion, rather than insertion. However, insertion is necessary for some scenarios, especially when patching codes are needed for smart contracts and mistaken deletions occur. In addition, we argue that the verifiability of blockchains is also significantly important, especially for the redactable ones, in which one block may have multiple versions. Hence, an efficient mechanism is required to invalidate history versions and incent distributed adoptions of editing operations. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and redactable blockchain with fully editing operations for the first time. One distinguishable property is the simultaneous achievement of fully editability of block objects and verifiability of blockchain state, with acceptable extra cost. Specifically, we construct the redactable blockchain based on a double trapdoor chameleon hash family, enabling computationally efficient and key-exposure resistant block editing. Additionally, we combine trapdoorless universal accumulators and the largest sequence number principle to make the blockchain state verifiable. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the security and feasibility of the proposed redactable blockchain.}

Inner and outer bounds on the rate regions defined under secrecy, privacy, communication, and distortion constraints are derived for both passive attack scenarios.

To build a secure living habitat, it’s vital to ensure the virtual-physical traceability that tracking a malicious player in the physical world via his avatars in virtual space. In this paper, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on biometric-based authentication and chameleon signature. First, aiming at disguise in virtual space, we design an avatar’s two-factor identity model to ensure the verifiability of avatar’s virtual identity and physical identity. Second, facing at authentication efficiency and keys holding cost, we propose a chameleon collision signature algorithm to efficiently ensure that the avatar’s virtual identity is associated with its physical identity. Finally, aiming at impersonation in the physical world, we design two decentralized authentication protocols based on the avatar’s identity model and the chameleon collision signature to achieve real-time authentication on the avatar’s identity. Security analysis indicates that the proposed authentication framework guarantees the consistency and traceability of the avatar’s identity. Simulation experiments show that the framework not only completes the decentralized authentication between avatars but also achieves virtual-physical tracking.}

	abstract = {Proxy re- encryption (PRE) provides a promising solution for applications requiring efficient and secure ciphertext conversion, such as secure cloud data sharing. While the one with the function of ciphertext evolution is more desirable for some long-term schemes involving key update. Recently, Yao et al. constructed an identity-based conditional proxy re- encryption scheme simultaneously supporting authorization and ciphertext evolution. However, its delegated ciphertext can be re- authorized, which may cause the authorization to exceed the original delegator’s expectation. In contrast, the single-hop PRE authorization scheme may be more appropriate for systems requiring better control over authorization. In this paper, an identity-based proxy re- encryption scheme with single-hop conditional delegation and multi-hop ciphertext evolution (IBPRE-SHCD-MHCE) is proposed. Also, its description, construction, and security analysis are given. The analysis and experimental comparison results show that the proposed scheme has improved the computational efficiency and storage consumption compared with the two underlying schemes.}

	abstract = {The efficiency of the profiling side-channel analysis can be significantly improved with machine learning techniques. Although powerful, a fundamental machine learning limitation of being data-hungry received little attention in the side-channel community. In practice, the maximum number of leakage traces that evaluators/attackers can obtain is constrained by the scheme requirements or the limited accessibility of the target. Even worse, various countermeasures in modern devices increase the conditions on the profiling size to break the target. This work demonstrates a practical approach to dealing with the lack of profiling traces. Instead of learning from a one-hot encoded label, transferring the labels to their distribution can significantly speed up the convergence of guessing entropy. By studying the relationship between all possible key candidates, we propose a new metric, denoted Label Correlation (LC), to evaluate the generalization ability of the profiling model. We validate LC with two common use cases: early stopping and network architecture search, and the results indicate its superior performance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of answering count queries for genomic data subject to perfect privacy constraints. Count queries are often used in applications that collect aggregate (population-wide) information from biomedical Databases (DBs) for analysis, such as Genome-wide association studies. Our goal is to design mechanisms for answering count queries of the following form: How many users in the database have a specific set of genotypes at certain locations in their genome? At the same time, we aim to achieve perfect privacy (zero information leakage) of the sensitive genotypes at a pre-specified set of secret locations. The sensitive genotypes could indicate rare diseases and/or other health traits one may want to keep private. We present both local and central count-query mechanisms for the above problem that achieves perfect information-theoretic privacy for sensitive genotypes while minimizing the expected absolute error (or per-user error probability, depending on the setting) of the query answer. We also derived a lower bound of the per-user probability of error for an arbitrary query-answering mechanism that satisfies perfect privacy. We show that our mechanisms achieve error close to the lower bound, and match the lower bound for some special cases. We numerically show that the performance of each mechanism depends on the data prior distribution, the intersection between the queried and sensitive genotypes, and the strength of the correlation in the genomic data sequence.}

	abstract = {Learning from fully-unlabeled data is challenging in Multimedia Forensics problems, such as Person Re-Identification and Text Authorship Attribution. Recent self-supervised learning methods have shown to be effective when dealing with fully-unlabeled data in cases where the underlying classes have significant semantic differences, as intra-class distances are substantially lower than inter-class distances. However, this is not the case for forensic applications in which classes have similar semantics and the training and test sets have disjoint identities. General self-supervised learning methods might fail to learn discriminative features in this scenario, thus requiring more robust strategies. We propose a strategy to tackle Person Re-Identification and Text Authorship Attribution by enabling learning from unlabeled data even when samples from different classes are not prominently diverse. We propose a novel ensemble-based clustering strategy whereby clusters derived from different configurations are combined to generate a better grouping for the data samples in a fully-unsupervised way. This strategy allows clusters with different densities and higher variability to emerge, reducing intra-class discrepancies without requiring the burden of finding an optimal configuration per dataset. We also consider different Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and subsequent distance computations between samples. We refine these distances by incorporating context and grouping them to capture complementary information. Our method is robust across both tasks, with different data modalities, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a fully-unsupervised solution without any labeling or human intervention.}

	abstract = {As an efficient and multi-platform scripting language, Lua is gaining increasing popularity in the industry. Unfortunately, Lua’s unique advantages also catch cybercriminals’ attention. A growing number of IoT malware authors switch to Lua for malicious payload development and then distribute malware in bytecode form. To impede malware code analysis, malware authors obfuscate standard Lua bytecode into a customized bytecode specification. Only the attached interpreter can execute that particular bytecode file. Rapid recovery of Lua obfuscated bytecode is essential for a swift response to new malware threats. However, existing generic code deobfuscation approaches cannot keep up with the pace of emerging threats. In this paper, we present a novel reverse engineering technique, called interpreter semantics testing . Given a customized interpreter used to execute obfuscated Lua bytecode, we construct a set of LuaGadgets that can adapt to the customized interpreter. Each LuaGadget contains a carefully chosen opcode sequence to fulfill an observable calculation—it is designed to test one or two particular opcodes at a time. Next, we mutate unknown opcode values to generate a bunch of test cases and run them using the customized interpreter; we can observe the expected result only when the mutation hits the opcode’s right value. We perform test case prioritization to cost-effectively recover the semantics of all obfuscated opcodes. Our approach makes no assumptions about the interpreter’s structure and is free from analyzing the numerous execution traces of opcode handlers. We have evaluated our tool, LuaHunt , with Lua malware variants and real-world applications. LuaHunt is able to recover the obfuscated bytecode’s semantics within 90 seconds for each test case, and all of our deobfuscation results can pass the correctness testing. The encouraging results demonstrate that LuaHunt is a promising tool to lighten the burden of security analysts.}

The recent surge of zero knowledge arguments has been focusing on its efficiency and practicality. Among them, GKR-based arguments have received wide attention and become the foundation of many zero-knowledge proof protocols. However, GKR-based protocols are restricted to layered arithmetic circuits. We propose Terrace , a new, efficient zero-knowledge argument system for general circuits, based on GKR. By dynamically patching cross-layer claims to the original circuit for verification instead of verifying those claims separately, Terrace is able to reduce the total circuit size and thus enjoys a logarithmic factor less verification time and proof size. Terrace is further extended to include the verification of non-arithmetic operations by rewriting those claims in the multilinear extension form. Experimental results demonstrate that Terrace enjoys a competitive performance on efficiency, and shows great promise in enabling low-cost verification of neural networks.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Location-Based Services (LBS), a large number of LBS providers outsource spatial data to cloud servers to reduce their high computational and storage burdens, but meanwhile incur some security issues such as location privacy leakage. Thus, extensive privacy-preserving LBS schemes have been proposed. However, the existing solutions using Bloom filter do not take into account the redundant bits that do not map information in Bloom filter, resulting in high computational overheads, and reveal the inclusion relationship in Bloom filter. To solve these issues, we propose an efficient Privacy-preserving Spatial Range Query (PSRQ) scheme by skillfully combining Geohash algorithm with Circular Shift and Coalesce Bloom Filter (CSC-BF) framework and Symmetric-key Hidden Vector Encryption (SHVE), which not only greatly reduces the computational cost of generating token but also speeds up the query efficiency on large-scale datasets. In addition, we design a Confused Bloom Filter (CBF) to confuse the inclusion relationship by confusing the values of 0 and 1 in the Bloom filter. Base on this, we further propose a more secure and practical enhanced scheme PSRQ + by using CBF and Geohash algorithm, which can support more query ranges and achieve adaptive security. Finally, formal security analysis proves that our schemes are secure against Indistinguishability under Chosen-Plaintext Attacks (IND-CPA) and PSRQ + achieves adaptive IND-CPA, and extensive experimental tests demonstrate that our schemes using million-level dataset improve the query efficiency by\n100×\ncompared with previous state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {State-of-the-art speaker recognition systems comprise a speaker embedding front-end followed by a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) back-end. The effectiveness of these components relies on the availability of a large amount of labeled training data. In practice, it is common for domains (e.g., language, channel, demographic) in which a system is deployed to differ from that in which a system has been trained. To close the resulting gap, domain adaptation is often essential for PLDA models. Among two of its variants are Heavy-tailed PLDA (HT-PLDA) and Gaussian PLDA (G-PLDA). Though the former better fits real feature spaces than does the latter, its popularity has been severely limited by its computational complexity and, especially, by the difficulty, it presents in domain adaptation, which results from its non-Gaussian property. Various domain adaptation methods have been proposed for G-PLDA. This paper proposes a generalized framework for domain adaptation that can be applied to both of the above variants of PLDA for speaker recognition. It not only includes several existing supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation methods but also makes possible more flexible usage of available data in different domains. In particular, we introduce here two new techniques: 1) correlation-alignment in the model level, and 2) covariance regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposed application of such techniques for domain adaptation w.r.t. HT-PLDA. The efficacy of the proposed techniques has been experimentally validated on NIST 2016, 2018, and 2019 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE’16, SRE’18 and SRE’19) datasets.}

	abstract = {In big data era, companies and organizations are keen to collect data from users and analyse their behaviour patterns to make decisions or predictions for profits. However, it undermines users’ privacy because the collected data can be quite sensitive and easy to leak. To address privacy problems, local differential privacy (LDP) has been proposed for untrusted data collectors to obtain statistical information without compromising user privacy. Most studies on LDP assume that all users fully cooperate and contribute to the data collection process and thus the collected dataset is complete. However, in practice, especially when user population is large, such assumption seldom holds due to communication loss, user unresponsiveness or unwillingness, and incomplete user-side data. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art LDP-based data collection schemes, such as GRR, OUE and OLH, cannot handle partial data collection effectively. In this paper, we propose collaborative sampling to address partial data collection in a multi-dimensional setting. Thanks to a two-phase mechanism, we can derive the optimal sampling rate for each dimension. The optimality is shown and proved with respect to the variance of estimated frequency. Besides that, collaborative sampling is general and can be used in GRR, OUE and OLH with minimal adaption. Through experimental results, we show collaborative sampling outperforms existing mainstream data collection schemes in partial multi-dimensional data collection.}

Secure computation aims to solve this problem, but current secure computation protocols often fail to provide efficient solutions due to large communication, especially in a real-life Internet network where the bandwidth and the delay can be unsatisfying. Assuming the existence of a trusted hardware component that is resilient to side-channel attacks and will faithfully compute a pre-agreed program, secure computation can be realized by each party sending its input to the hardware and receiving the execution result back. However, a recent work of Lu et al. (ESORICS’21) points out that the hardware components can’t be fully trusted. In this work, we improve the semi-trusted hardware model of Lu et al., and we propose secure computation protocols with low communication in the new model. We observe that the ESORICS’21 two-party computation protocol have some security flaws; in this work, we fix them and improve its online efficiency. Moreover, we propose an efficient constant-round secure multi-party computation protocol which has a communication cost of\n(n−1)λ+2(n−1)ℓ\nbits, where\nn\nis the number of the parties,\nλ\nis the security parameter and\nℓ\nis the input/output size.

	abstract = {Android malware and its variants are a major challenge for mobile platforms. However, there are two main problems in the existing detection methods:\na\n) The detection method lacks the evolution ability for Android malware, which leads to the low detection rate of the detection model for malware and its variants.\nb\n) Traditional detection methods require centralized data for model training, however, the aggregation of training samples is limited due to the infectivity of malware and growing data privacy concerns, centralized detection methods are difficult to be applied in actual detection scenarios. In this paper, we propose FEDriod, a comprehensive Android malware detection method based on federated learning architecture that protects against growing Android malware or emerging Android malware variants. Specifically, we employ genetic evolution strategy to simulate the evolution of Android malware and develop potential malware variants from typical Android malware. Then, we customize the Android malware detection model based on residual neural network to achieve high detection accuracy. Finally, to achieve the protection sensitive data, we develope a federated learning framework to allows multiple Android malware detection agencies to jointly build a comprehensive Android malware detection model. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of FEDriod on the CIC, Drebin, and Contagio authoritative datasets. Experimental results show that our local model outperforms all baseline classifiers. In the federal scenario, our proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art detection methods, especially in the cross-dataset evaluation, the F1 of FEDriod is 98.53%. More important, we performed genetic evolution experiments on the Drebin dataset, and the results showed that our proposed method has the ability to detect Android malware variants.}

	abstract = {In an acceleration-based Secure Device Pairing (SDP) scheme, two unauthenticated devices continuously measure their own acceleration. If the similarity of their measurements are sufficiently high, the devices will build a secure communication channel assume that it is hard for any attacker to estimate their measurements in real-time. This paper demonstrates that the assumption does not hold and further proposes an effective Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on acceleration-based SDP schemes. That is to say, an MitM adversary is able to quickly estimate the acceleration measurements of the target devices with automatic visual tracking technologies, and then compromise the device’s communication channel by impersonating the target devices with the estimated measurements. The present attack is extensively evaluated on acceleration-based SDP schemes in indoor and outdoor environments. The evaluation results show that the device’s acceleration can be estimated with high accuracy in real time. Thus, the present MitM attack is practical to defeat the acceleration-based SDP schemes.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of mobile Internet, smart terminal devices, and GPS positioning technology has generated a vast number of trajectory data that location-based applications can utilize. However, delivering LBSs based on trajectories without extra protection may expose the personal information of users and even their social ties. Despite the fact that many works have been offered to achieve differential privacy for trajectory correlation, the vast majority of them only consider the trajectory correlation of a single user, and privacy protection for trajectory correlation amongst multiple users is not considered. Directly applying these works to protect correlation amongst multiple users may lead to the low availability of published trajectory data. To address the above challenges, we propose a trajectory correlation privacy-preserving mechanism (TCPP) that fulfills differential privacy. Specifically, we first apply the Euclidean distance to filter out a set of trajectories whose correlation needs to be protected. Then, we employ the Kalman filter to generate a dataset with high availability from the set of trajectories. Finally, we present a mechanism for publishing trajectories that preserves the trajectory correlation based on a customized privacy budget allocation strategy. Rigid security analysis shows that our proposed mechanism can well preserve the correlation privacy of trajectories. Experimental results on real-world datasets further demonstrate the privacy, availability and time efficiency advantages of our mechanism.}

	abstract = {Recently, it has been widely known that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable and easily broken by adversarial attacks. To mitigate the adversarial vulnerability, many defense algorithms have been proposed. Recently, to improve adversarial robustness, many works try to enhance feature representation by imposing more direct supervision on the discriminative feature. However, existing approaches lack an understanding of learning adversarially robust feature representation. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called Robust Proxy Learning. In the proposed method, the model explicitly learns robust feature representations with robust proxies. To this end, firstly, we demonstrate that we can generate class-representative robust features by adding class-wise robust perturbations. Then, we use the class representative features as robust proxies. With the class-wise robust features, the model explicitly learns adversarially robust features through the proposed robust proxy learning framework. Through extensive experiments, we verify that we can manually generate robust features, and our proposed learning framework could increase the robustness of the DNNs.}

	abstract = {Quantum Anonymous Private Information Retrieval (QAPIR) allows a user to retrieve an item from a database anonymously thus achieving better user privacy. Recently, Khan et al. proposed the first QAPIR protocol (IEEE Trans. Commun., 2022), which is the only known QAPIR protocol. However, a symbol coincidence error occurs when the main ingredients are combined to form this QAPIR protocol. Furthermore, it requires perfect (\nn+1\n)-partite\nd\n-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states to be pre-shared among the nodes where\nd≥N\nand\nN\nis the size of the database. However, the difficulties in implementing the preparation of high-dimensional GHZ states and the quantum-computing-based queries under current technologies lead to the impracticability of this QAPIR protocol due to the extremely high dimensionalities of GHZ states and oracle operations when large databases are involved. To address these issues, we first point out the symbol coincidence error in Khan et al.’s QAPIR protocol and then give an improvement on it. Finally, we propose a practical QAPIR protocol based on quantum key distribution. We analyze its performance under certain types of noise. We also prove the security of our QAPIR protocol in an active adversary scenario where active dishonest users and database owner are taken into account. Compared with Khan et al.’s protocol, our protocol is easier to implement under current technologies, and can work over the noisy quantum channel. It provides a practical way for the design of QAPIR protocols.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of face forgery techniques, the existing frame-based deepfake video detection methods have fell into a dilemma that frame-based methods may fail when encountering extremely realistic images. To overcome the above problem, many approaches attempted to model the spatio-temporal inconsistency of videos to distinguish real and fake videos. However, current works model spatio-temporal inconsistency by combining intra-frame and inter-frame information, but ignore the disturbance caused by facial motions that would limit further improvement in detection performance. To address this issue, we investigate into long and short range inter-frame motions and propose a novel dynamic difference learning method to distinguish between the inter-frame differences caused by face manipulation and the inter-frame differences caused by facial motions in order to model precise spatio-temporal inconsistency for deepfake video detection. Moreover, we elaborately design a dynamic fine-grained difference capture module (DFDC-module) and a multi-scale spatio-temporal aggregation module (MSA-module) to collaboratively model spatio-temporal inconsistency. Specifically, the DFDC-module applies self-attention mechanism and fine-grained denoising operation to eliminate the differences caused by facial motions and generates long range difference attention maps. The MSA-module is devised to aggregate multi-direction and multi-scale temporal information to model spatio-temporal inconsistency. The existing 2D CNNs can be extended into dynamic spatio-temporal inconsistency capture networks by integrating the proposed two modules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in different benchmark datasets.}

This paper combines AAoA, EAoA, channel gain as well as phase noise features to propose a novel physical layer authentication scheme for mmWave MIMO communication systems. Based on the limit posterior Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (LPBCRB) and maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation theories, we first develop an efficient approach for the evaluation of hardware phase noise and mmWave channel features. To depict the authentication performance of the new scheme, we then apply the statistical signal processing and hypothesis testing theories to derive the closed-form expressions for false alarm and detection probabilities under the scheme. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical models and to demonstrate the capability of the proposed authentication scheme against impersonation attacks.}

	abstract = {We present a supervised semantic hashing framework, named Label-Consistent Generalized Hashing (LCGH). The main novelty of LCGH is the explicit retention of information which may be irrelevant in training, but possibly useful for generalizing to unseen test classes. This is in stark contrast to typical semantic hashing methods which seek to remove redundant feature information from their hash codes in order to maximize the margin between hash codes of dissimilar data. This typical strategy leaves hash codes narrowly viable for discerning between training classes, and inadequate in discriminating between unseen test classes. Instead of limiting the information content of hash codes to those provided by the training labels, LCGH enhances its codes with information content from both supervised and unsupervised sources, improving their ability to discriminate across a wider range of data. To do so, LCGH builds upon the foundation of first agreeing with the provided training labels (label-consistency) and then incorporating possibly useful information using a reconstruction loss. In this way, LCGH respects the reliably given label information before exploring the addition of possibly useful ones. The outcome is a hashing scheme with slightly weaker within-domain (training and test classes are the same) retrieval performance, but much stronger cross-domain (training and test classes are disjoint) performance.}

	abstract = {Binary analysis of software is a critical step in cyber forensics applications such as program vulnerability assessment and malware detection. This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often necessitates converting the software’s binary file data to assembly language. The conversion process requires information about the binary file’s target instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We evaluate our approach using two different datasets: binaries from 12 ISAs and 23 ISAs. Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA identification results in ~98% accuracy compared to the ~91% accuracy of state-of-the-art features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to 16x while maintaining accuracy of ISA identification above 97%.}

	abstract = {In face of an increasing number of automotive cyber-physical threat scenarios, the issue of adversarial destabilization of the lateral motion of target vehicles through direct attacks on their steering systems has been extensively studied. A more subtle question is whether a cyberattacker can destabilize the target vehicle lateral motion through improper engagement of the vehicle brakes and/or anti-lock braking systems (ABS). Motivated by such a question, this paper investigates the impact of cyber-physical attacks that exploit the braking/ABS systems to adversely affect the lateral motion stability of the targeted vehicles. Using a hybrid physical/dynamic tire-road friction model, it is shown that if a braking system/ABS attacker manages to continuously vary the longitudinal slips of the wheels, they can violate the necessary conditions for asymptotic stability of the underlying linear time-varying (LTV) dynamics of the lateral motion. Furthermore, the minimal perturbations of the wheel longitudinal slips that result in lateral motion instability under fixed slip values are derived. Finally, a real-time algorithm for monitoring the lateral motion dynamics of vehicles against braking/ABS cyber-physical attacks is devised. This algorithm, which can be efficiently computed using the modest computational resources of automotive embedded processors, can be utilized along with other intrusion detection techniques to infer whether a vehicle braking system/ABS is experiencing a cyber-physical attack. Numerical simulations in the presence of realistic CAN bus delays, destabilizing slip value perturbations obtained from solving quadratic programs on an embedded ARM Cortex-M3 emulator, and side-wind gusts demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years in many fields. The success of DL typically relies on a considerable amount of training data and the expensive model optimization process. Therefore, a trained DL model and its corresponding training data have become valuable assets whose intellectual property (IP) needs to be protected. Once a DL model or its training dataset is released, there is currently no mechanism for the entity that owns one part to establish a clear relationship with the other. In this paper, we aim to reveal the integrated relationship between a given DL model and the corresponding training dataset, by framing the problem of knowledge representation of a dataset with respect to DL models trained on it: how to effectively represent the knowledge transferred from a training dataset to a DL model? Our basic idea is that the knowledge transferred from a training dataset to a DL model can be uniquely represented by the model’s decision boundary. Therefore, we design a novel generation method that utilizes geometric consistency to find the samples supporting the decision boundary, which can serve as the proxy for the knowledge representation. We evaluate our method in three different cases: IP audit of training data, IP audit of DL models, and adversarial knowledge distillation. The experimental results show that our method can improve the performance of existing works in all cases, which confirm that our method can effectively represent the knowledge transferred from a training dataset to a DL model.}

	abstract = {Malicious binaries have caused data and monetary loss to people, and these binaries keep evolving rapidly nowadays. With tons of new unknown attack binaries, one essential daily task for security analysts and researchers is to analyze and effectively identify malicious parts and report the critical behaviors within the binaries. While manual analysis is slow and ineffective, automated malware report generation is a long-term goal for malware analysts and researchers. This study moves one step toward the goal by identifying essential functions in malicious binaries to accelerate and even automate the analyzing process. We design and implement an expert system based on our proposed graph neural network called MalwareExpert. The system pinpoints the essential functions of an analyzed sample and visualizes the relationships between involved parts. We evaluate our proposed approach using executable binaries in the Windows operating system. The evaluation results show that our approach has a competitive detection performance (97.3% accuracy and 96.5% recall rate) compared to existing malware detection models. Moreover, it gives an intuitive and easy-to-understand explanation of the model predictions by visualizing and correlating essential functions. We compare the identified essential functions reported by our system against several expert-made malware analysis reports from multiple sources. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the pinpointed functions indicate accurate directions. In the best case, the top 2% of functions reported from the system can cover all expert-annotated functions in three steps. We believe that the MalwareExpert system has shed light on automated program behavior analysis.}

	abstract = {The surging interest in cryptocurrency has revitalized the research for digital signature schemes with strong security. In particular, signature schemes are investigated to resist the malleability attacks in cryptocurrency platforms. However, existing signature schemes only conquer partial malleability attacks due to various sources of attacks. Other solutions of new transaction realizations cannot simultaneously avoid the malleability attacks on both standard and contract transactions. Furthermore, the malleability attack becomes more stubborn in fast clearing applications. In this paper, we propose SigNT, an accessional signature scheme with unmalleable transaction implementations. The key of SigNT is an improved interactive signature scheme for securely instant confirmation of transactions. Unlike standard signatures, this signature is generated by the owner and block producers. Combining it with several other optimizations ( i.e., hash execution of intermediate transactions and secret-based claiming conditions), SigNT achieves complete resistance against malleability attacks in both the standard and contract transactions. As an example, we show an implementation in Bitcoin with the “providing a deposit” protocol. The security analysis and comparative experiments demonstrate that SigNT has the best resistance against malleability attacks than previous malleability solutions. Besides, better performance is achieved than other schemes.}

However, in addition to complex forgeries as the deepfakes, very simple yet effective manipulation techniques not involving any use of state-of-the-art editing tools still exist and prove dangerous. This is the case of audio splicing for speech signals, i.e., to concatenate and combine multiple speech segments obtained from different recordings of a person in order to cast a new fake speech. Indeed, by simply adding a few words to an existing speech we can completely alter its meaning. In this work, we address the overlooked problem of detection and localization of audio splicing from different models of acquisition devices. Our goal is to determine whether an audio track under analysis is pristine, or it has been manipulated by splicing one or multiple segments obtained from different device models. Moreover, if a recording is detected as spliced, we identify where the modification has been introduced in the temporal dimension. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts model-specific features from the audio recording. After extracting the features, we determine whether there has been a manipulation through a clustering algorithm. Finally, we identify the point where the modification has been introduced through a distance-measuring technique. The proposed method allows to detect and localize multiple splicing points within a recording.}

A threshold signature scheme should be functionally interchangeable, meaning that a signature produced by a threshold scheme should be verifiable by the same algorithm used for non-threshold signatures. To resist future attacks from quantum adversaries, lattice-based threshold signatures are desirable. However, the performance of existing lattice-based threshold signing protocols is still far from practical. This paper presents the first lattice-based\nt\n-out-of-\nn\nthreshold signature scheme with functional interchangeability that has been implemented. To build an\nt\n-out-of-\nn\naccess structure for arbitrary\nt≤n\n, we first present a novel\nt\n-out-of-\nn\nversion of the SPDZ MPC protocol. We avoid using the MPC protocol to evaluate hash operations for high concrete efficiency. Moreover, we design an efficient distributed rejection sampling protocol. Consequently, the online phase of our distributed signing protocol takes only 0.5 seconds in the two-party setting and 7.3 seconds in the 12-party setting according to our implementation. As a byproduct, our scheme also presents a periodic key refreshment mechanism and offers proactive security.}

	abstract = {Modular exponentiation is a vital function in public key cryptography. Dozens of protocols, including encryption schemes, signature schemes, pseudorandom functions, and more, perform this operation on a secret base and/or a secret exponent. In a multiparty computation setting, these secret data might be shared over multiple parties who wish to compute this modular exponentiation in a secure and distributed way. However, whereas typical frameworks for secure multiparty computation based on secret sharing provide a basic tool box of secure distributed computation of, most importantly, randomness generation, addition, and multiplication, the status quo of secure distributed modular exponentiation is unsatisfactory. In this work, we provide a complete and comprehensive overview on existing protocols for perfectly secure distributed exponentiation differing depending on whether the inputs and outcomes are public or shared. We perform a detailed complexity computation of the currently existing protocols, observing that earlier authors have overestimated the complexity of their own protocols, and close the remaining open problem: protocols for secure distributed exponentiation with secret base, secret exponent, and public outcome. We prove that the presented protocol is universally composably secure in the presence of malicious adversaries. We finally exemplify the practical relevance of the new protocol by demonstrating how it can be used for pseudorandom generation and signing.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the limit covert rate of the backscatter communication systems based on undecodable ambient radio frequency (RF) signals over additive white Gaussian noise channel. In the considered network, source node Alice expects to transmit information to receiver Bob without being detected by warden Willie, by backscattering undecodable ambient RF signals. In this case, it is challenging for Bob to recover the information from Alice, since the undecodable signals result in both unknown additive and multiplicative interference. A subtle communication strategy is proposed to alleviate the influences of the interference, by which we prove that no matter Willie can or cannot decode the information from the RF source and then eliminate its interference, the limit covert rate is subject to the well-known square root law (i.e.,\nO(\nn\n−\n−\n√\n)\nbits per\nn\nchannel uses). This interesting result means that even if the RF source is a cooperative node of Willie (e.g., a jammer deployed by Willie to restrict Alice from active transmission), Alice can still covertly and reliably transmit information to Bob by backscattering the ambient RF signals (e.g., the malicious jamming signals).}

	abstract = {The technique of packing multiple values into one message without losing homomorphic computation properties is the main workhorse that drives many exciting advances in applying lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes to privacy-preserving Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS). However, this technique does not directly work for the classic Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme, limiting the use of the Paillier scheme in the privacy-preserving MLaaS. To enrich the applications of Paillier in privacy-preserving MLaaS, we present a set of new methods for efficient linear computations over packed values under the Paillier scheme, such as vector multiplication, matrix multiplication, and convolutional calculation between ciphertexts and plaintexts. Different from the packing methods of lattice-based schemes, the Paillier packing method naturally allows higher packing capability for values in lower bit-length. This property can significantly benefit privacy-preserving MLaaS, as the values of user inputs and parameters of machine learning models are often quantized into low bits (e.g., 1–8 bits). We conduct comparisons based on different linear computation tasks, the proposed methods under the Paillier scheme clearly outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of communication and computational efficiency, especially in realistic scenarios. For example, compared to one of the recent arts CrypTFlow2 (Rathee et al., 2020), the communication cost of our solution can be\n21.7×\nsmaller at best. Thanks to the reduction of communication cost, the runtime can be\n2.46×\nfaster than CrypTFlow2 at the median-country-speed of current global mobile broadband.}

	abstract = {Electric network frequency (ENF) analysis is a promising forensic technique for authenticating multimedia recordings and detecting tampering. The validity of the ENF analysis heavily relies on the capability of extracting high-quality ENF signals from multimedia recordings. This paper analyzes and compares two representative methods for extracting ENF signals from visual signals acquired by cameras using the rolling-shutter mechanism. The first method proposed in prior work, direct concatenation , ignores the idle period of each frame. The second method proposed in this paper, periodic zeroing-out , inserts zeros to missing sample points instead of ignoring the idle period. Our theoretical analyses of using multirate signal processing reveal and experiments confirm that while the first method can extract ENF signals without knowing the exact value of camera read-out time, there exists some mild distortion to extracted ENF signals. In contrast, the second method taking the read-out time as the additional input is capable of extracting distortion-free ENF signals, and its frequency component of the highest strength is always located at the nominal frequency. Additionally, we examine aliased DC and negative ENF components caused by the two methods and show that their impact on the accuracy of frequency estimation is minimum. This paper facilitates the fundamental understanding of extracting ENF signals from videos. The research findings imply that the periodic zeroing-out method offers more accurate frequency estimates, but the performance improvement is moderate.}

	abstract = {Presentation attack detection (PAD) is a critical component of automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs). However, existing PAD technologies based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) mainly rely on local information, ignoring the global continuity and correlation of physiological structures. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate presentation attack instruments (PAIs) that cater to the unique OCT characteristics leads to the insufficient evaluation of PAD. The identification features, including external fingerprint (EF), internal fingerprint (IF), and subcutaneous sweat pore (SSP), provide valuable information about the intrinsic connections of physiological structures. Such intrinsic connections hold potential clues for PAD. Building upon this premise, this paper proposed a novel PAD method based on three OCT hand-crafted features: EF-IF self-matching score (SMS), SSP number (SN), and SSP coincidence rate (SCR). These simple yet effective PAD features offer a more precise and detailed description of the internal physiological structure, enabling accurate distinction between presentation attack (PA) and bona-fide. The proposed method achieves a 4% Equal Error Rate (EER), significantly outperforming other existing PAD methods. Additionally, the cross-device experiment demonstrates the generalization capability of the proposed method on both our dataset and the public OCT dataset.}

	abstract = {Since the rapid development of face recognition systems using 3D cameras, the public has demanded great safety regulations for these devices. As a closely related topic, multimodal face anti-spoofing (FAS) has become an indispensable part of face recognition systems. However, existing multimodal FAS tools suffer from performance degradation under external low-lighting conditions and insufficient representation capabilities of fusion features. To address these issues, we present an attention-aware dual-stream fusion method using 3D cameras (i.e., IR+Depth) and considering both fine-grained and global features. Specifically, we introduce a surface normal generator using depth maps to obtain robust and discriminative representations. Then, we leverage the attention mechanism to split each stream into two branches. The first branch explores complementary global information between different modalities, while the second branch captures subtle and local features from each modality. The system regards multimodal FAS as a fine-grained classification problem. Moreover, to ensure that local areas in the image do not overlap and belong to the same class, a joint loss function is developed and proven to further boost the performance of FAS. We extensively evaluate our proposed strategies on various multimodal databases, and the results show that when compared with current state-of-the-art multimodal methods, our framework achieves superior performance.}

	abstract = {With the continuous development of deep learning in the field of image generation models, a large number of vivid forged faces have been generated and spread on the Internet. These high-authenticity artifacts could grow into a threat to society security. Existing face forgery detection methods directly utilize the obtained public shared or centralized data for training but ignore the personal privacy and security issues when personal data couldn’t be centralizedly shared in real-world scenarios. Additionally, different distributions caused by diverse artifact types would further bring adverse influences on the forgery detection task. To solve the mentioned problems, the paper proposes a novel generalized residual Federated learning for face Forgery detection (FedForgery). The designed variational autoencoder aims to learn robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect forgery faces (with diverse or even unknown artifact types). Furthermore, the general federated learning strategy is introduced to construct distributed detection model trained collaboratively with multiple local decentralized devices, which could further boost the representation generalization. Experiments conducted on publicly available face forgery detection datasets prove the superior performance of the proposed FedForgery. The designed novel generalized face forgery detection protocols and source code would be publicly available at https://github.com/GANG370/FedForgery .}

	abstract = {The aggregated reverse kNN (ARkNN) query aims to identify one query record with the maximum influence set and has become a powerful tool to support optimal decision-making in crowdsensing. Considering data privacy and query privacy, ARkNN queries should be performed in a private manner. Unfortunately, existing schemes cannot support privacy-preserving ARkNN queries over crowd-sensed data. To address this issue, we propose two efficient and privacy-preserving ARkNN query schemes with different security levels, named the BARQ scheme and the EARQ scheme, where the former can only protect data privacy while the latter can protect both data privacy and query privacy. Specifically, we first formalize the models of privacy-preserving ARkNN queries and propose our BARQ scheme based on a random response (RR) frequency oracle. Then, we design a privacy-preserving hardware-assisted reverse kNN query determination (PRkD) scheme for privately determining whether a query record is among the RkNN of a data record. After that, we present our EARQ scheme by leveraging the PRkD scheme to protect query privacy and integrating the RR frequency oracle to protect data privacy. In addition, our rigorous security analysis demonstrates that the BARQ scheme can well protect data privacy, and the EARQ scheme can protect both data privacy and query privacy. Extensive experimental results illustrate that they have high accuracy in query results and are efficient in computational costs and communication overheads.}

	abstract = {The world has observed an increasing trend in the development of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) for cross-silo collaborative model training over sensitive data. As the first essential step of cross-silo PPML, it is critical that the parties can align their dataset with privacy assurance, i.e., private data join . However, the existing private data join methods typically leak the ID information in the dataset intersection, which often raises privacy concerns. In this work, we propose iPrivJoin : a novel framework of ID-private data join for PPML. Compared with naively using circuit-based Private Set Intersection (circuit-PSI) for data join, the proposed framework has two advantages: 1) data volume reduction. iPrivJoin utilizes oblivious shuffle to securely trim off the redundant data that is outside the intersection, while the entire dataset needs to be carried to further process in the circuit-PSI based approach. 2) efficiency improvement. iPrivJoin introduces a new private encoding technique to avoid the expensive circuit evaluation that is needed in circuit-PSI. As a result, compared with directly using circuit-PSI, PPML with iPrivJoin enjoys approximately\n3×\nof speedup. Moreover, we propose a new oblivious shuffle protocol, which may be of independent interest. It achieves\n1.44×\nof speedup to the state-of-the-art in the real-world WAN network setting.}

	abstract = {Detecting 3D mask attacks to a face recognition system is challenging. Although genuine faces and 3D face masks show significantly different remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals, rPPG-based face anti-spoofing methods often suffer from performance degradation due to unstable face alignment in the video sequence and weak rPPG signals. To enhance the rPPG signal in a motion-robust way, a landmark-anchored face stitching method is proposed to align the faces robustly and precisely at the pixel-wise level by using both SIFT keypoints and facial landmarks. To better encode the rPPG signal, a weighted spatial-temporal representation is proposed, which emphasizes the face regions with rich blood vessels. In addition, characteristics of rPPG signals in different color spaces are jointly utilized. To improve the generalization capability, a lightweight EfficientNet with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is designed to extract both spatial and temporal features from the rPPG spatial-temporal representation for classification. The proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets under both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. The proposed method shows a significant and consistent improvement in performance over other state-of-the-art rPPG-based methods for face spoofing detection.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to jointly train a global learning model while keeping their training data locally, thereby protecting clients’ privacy. However, there still exist some security issues in FL, e.g., the honest-but-curious servers may mine privacy from clients’ model updates, and the malicious clients may launch poisoning attacks to disturb or break global model training. Moreover, most previous works focus on the security issues of FL in the presence of only honest-but-curious servers or only malicious clients. In this paper, we consider a stronger and more practical threat model in FL, where the honest-but-curious servers and malicious clients coexist, named as the non-fully trusted model. In the non-fully trusted FL, privacy protection schemes for honest-but-curious servers are executed to ensure that all model updates are indistinguishable, which makes malicious model updates difficult to detect. Toward this end, we present an Adaptive Privacy-Preserving FL (Ada-PPFL) scheme with Differential Privacy (DP) as the underlying technology, to simultaneously protect clients’ privacy and eliminate the adverse effects of malicious clients on model training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive DP strategy to achieve strong client-level privacy protection while minimizing the impact on the prediction accuracy of the global model. In addition, we introduce DPAD, an algorithm specifically designed to precisely detect malicious model updates, even in cases where the updates are protected by DP measures. Finally, the theoretical analysis and experimental results further illustrate that the proposed Ada-PPFL enables client-level privacy protection with 35% DP-noise savings, and maintains similar prediction accuracy to models without malicious attacks.}

However, existing efforts for secure data sharing are either inflexible, insufficiently-secure or inefficient. In this paper, we invent PS-ME, the first Privacy-aware and Security-enhanced efficient Matchmaking Encryption (ME) for flexible data sharing. To be more specific, we first formulate an identity-based broadcast matchmaking encryption (IB-BME) for one-to-many data sharing, which enables both participants to specify respective access policies to the encrypted data, such that the data can be revealed by multiple recipients in the case that both access policies are satisfied. In IB-BME, a general matchmaking transformation solution realizing one-to-many sharing is initialized. We also formulate the PS-ME with the general matchmaking transformation solution of IB-BME as the underlying approach, which in addition to featuring IB-BME’s all desirable properties, enables efficient decryption, identity anonymity and CCA-security, where we address the open problem of ME regarding CCA-security (raised in CRYPTO’2019). Finally, the comprehensively rigorous security proofs indicate the security of the suggested methodologies.

The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.}

	abstract = {Skin distortion is a long standing challenge in fingerprint matching, which causes false non-matches. Previous studies have shown that the recognition rate can be improved by estimating the distortion field from a distorted fingerprint and then rectifying it into a normal fingerprint. However, existing rectification methods are based on principal component representation of distortion fields, which is not accurate and are very sensitive to finger pose. In this paper, we propose a rectification method where a self-reference based network is utilized to directly estimate the dense distortion field of distorted fingerprint instead of its low dimensional representation. This method can output accurate distortion fields of distorted fingerprints with various finger poses and distortion patterns. We conducted experiments on FVC2004 DB1_A, expanded Tsinghua Distorted Fingerprint database (with additional distorted fingerprints in diverse finger poses and distortion patterns) and a latent fingerprint database. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art rectification performance in terms of distortion field estimation and rectified fingerprint matching.}

	abstract = {Anonymous cryptocurrencies are distributed applications based on blockchain technology that enhance the anonymity of user transactions. However, they also provide cover for many criminal activities. Existing traceable modifications of anonymous transaction protocols do not support public verification of the traceability of transactions, meaning dishonest users can still evade tracing by forging partial proofs. In this paper, we first propose EPoK, which is a partially extractable zero-knowledge proof scheme designed to address this issue. We provide the instantiation of EPoK, as well as its formal security proofs. Combined with EPoK and the classic anonymous transaction protocol RingCT, we propose a traceable anonymous transaction protocol TRCT for tracing participants’ addresses and transaction amounts in anonymous transactions. Compared to previous works, TRCT is the first to implement public verification of the transaction’s traceability while still maintaining anonymity. This ensures that users cannot forge relevant proofs to evade tracing. We present and prove the security properties of TRCT, and experimentally compare its efficiency with the original RingCT protocol. The result shows that the extra overhead generated by TRCT is small.}

	abstract = {Botnets extensively leverage Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to establish reliable communication channels between bots and Command and Control (C&C) servers. Numerous character-level DGA classifiers have been extensively studied to detect and classify domain names generated by DGAs. Meanwhile, a series of adversarial domain generation algorithms have been proposed to evade DGA classifiers. Although the existing domain name generation algorithms have progressed against DGA classifier, their anti-detection abilities are still weak. This paper proposes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network-based adversarial DGA with high anti-detection ability, referred to as ReplaceDGA. ReplaceDGA requires no knowledge of the targeted DGA classifiers. It first builds a prediction model for benign domain names using the BiLSTM network to model the semantic relationship hidden within benign domain names and then replaces two characters of each input benign domain name based on the prediction model to maximize the similarity between the benign and generated domain names. Our experimental results validate that ReplaceDGA successfully evades various character-level DGA classifiers even after they are retrained by domain names generated by ReplaceDGA and outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial DGAs in anti-detection ability, repetition rate, and collision rate. Our study of ReplaceDGA promotes the urgent need for developing more comprehensive and robust DGA classifiers that consider other factors besides character-level information of domain names.}

Seeking to jointly address both privacy and utility, in this paper we connect the layer-wise relevance propagation with gradient descent for injecting proper noise into gradients. We also improve the conventional gradient clipping method by dividing the gradients into several groups; thus, minimizing the gradient distortion. Since the noisy gradient causes the undetermined descent direction and might adversely affect the loss minimization, we use the NoisyMin algorithm to select the best step size for each gradient perturbation. Finally, we integrate the adaptive optimizer into the gradient descent. In addition to improving the model utility, we also leverage the leading Sinh-Normal noise addition mechanism to achieve truncated concentrated differential privacy (tCDP) – as demonstrated by our rigorous analysis. Our experimental evaluations also validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {The highly heterogeneous nature of images found in real-world environments, such as online sharing platforms, has been one of the long-standing obstacles to the transition of steganalysis techniques outside the laboratory. Recent advances in identifying the properties of images relevant to steganalysis as well as the effectiveness of deep neural networks on highly heterogeneous datasets have laid some groundwork for resolving this problem. Despite this progress, we argue that the way the game played between the steganographer and the steganalyst is currently modeled lacks some important features expected in a real-world environment: 1) the steganographer can adapt her cover source choice to the environment and/or to the steganalyst’s classifier, 2) the distribution of cover sources in the environment impacts the optimal threshold for a given classifier, and 3) the steganalyst and steganographer have different goals, hence different utilities. We propose to take these facts into account using a two-player non-zero-sum game constrained by an environment composed of multiple cover sources. We then show how to convert this non-zero-sum game into an equivalent zero-sum game, allowing us to propose two methods to find Nash equilibria for this game: a standard method using the double oracle algorithm and a minimum regret method based on approximating a set of atomistic classifiers. Applying these methods to contemporary steganography and steganalysis in a realistic environment, we show that classifiers which do not adapt to the environment severely underperform when the steganographer is allowed to select into which cover source to embed.}

	abstract = {The widely applications of deep learning have raised concerns about the privacy issues in deep neural networks. Model inversion attack aims to reconstruct specific details of each private training sample from a given neural network. However, limited to the availability of useful information, reconstructing distinctive private training samples still has a long way to go. In this paper, the requirements to reconstruct distinctive private training samples are investigated using information entropy. We find that more information is needed to reconstruct distinctive samples and propose to use the often ignored hidden information to achieve this goal. To better utilize this information, Amplified-MIA is proposed. In Amplified-MIA, a nonlinear amplification layer is inserted between the target network and the attack network. This nonlinear amplification layer further contains a nonlinear amplification function. The definition of the nonlinear amplification function is given and the effect of this nonlinear amplification function on the entropy of the hidden information is derived. The proposed nonlinear amplification function can amplify the small prediction vector entries and enlarge the differences between different prediction vectors in the same class. Thus, the hidden information can be better utilized by the attack network and distinctive private samples can be reconstructed. Various experiments are performed to empirically analyze the effects of the nonlinear amplification function on the reconstruction results. The reconstruction results on three different datasets show that the proposed Amplified-MIA outperforms existing works on almost all tasks. Especially, it achieves up to 68% performance gain of the Pixel Accuracy score over the direct inversion method on the hardest face reconstruction task.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technique to extend the network coverage and improve spectral efficiency. This paper investigates an IRS-assisted terahertz (THz) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system based on hybrid precoding with the presence of eavesdropper. Two types of sparse RF chain antenna structures are adopted, i.e., sub-connected structure and fully connected structure. First, cluster heads are selected for each beam, and analog precoding based on discrete phase is designed. Then, users are clustered based on channel correlation, and NOMA technology is employed to serve the users. In addition, a low-complexity forced-zero method is utilized to design digital precoding in order to eliminate inter-cluster interference. On this basis, we propose a secure transmission scheme to maximize the sum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the power allocation and phase shifts of IRS subject to the total transmit power budget, minimal achievable rate requirement of each user, and IRS reflection coefficients. Due to multiple coupled variables, the formulated problem leads to a non-convex issue. We apply the Taylor series expansion and semidefinite programming to convert the original non-convex problem into a convex one. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a feasible solution of the original problem. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and deploying IRS can bring significant beamforming gains to suppress the eavesdropping.}

	abstract = {With the development of deep learning, deep neural network (DNN)-based application have become an indispensable aspect of daily life. However, recent studies have shown that these well-trained DNN models are vulnerable to model inversion attacks (MIAs), where attackers can recover their training data with high fidelity. Although several defensive strategies have been proposed to mitigate the impact of such attacks, existing defenses will inevitably compromise the model performance and are ineffective against more sophisticated attacks, such as Mirror (An et al., 2022). In this paper, we introduce a novel GAN-based defense approach against model inversion attacks. Unlike previous works that perturb the prediction vector of the model, we manipulate the training procedure of the victim model by incorporating carefully-designed GAN-based fake samples. We also adjust the loss of the inversed samples to inject misleading features into the protected label of the victim model. Additionally, we adopt the concept of continual learning to improve the utility of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CelebA, VGG-Face, and VGG-Face2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defenses against state-of-the-art model inversion attacks, including DMI (Chen et al., 2021), Mirror (An et al., 2022), Privacy (Fredrikson et al., 2014), and AMI (Yang et al., 2019). It is shown that our proposed method can also retain a high defense performance in black-box scenarios.}

	abstract = {Personalized federated learning (PFL), as a novel federated learning (FL) paradigm, is capable of generating personalized models for heterogenous clients. Combined with a meta-learning mechanism, PFL can further improve the convergence performance with few-shot training. However, meta-learning based PFL has two stages of gradient descent in each local training round, therefore posing a more serious challenge in information leakage. In this paper, we propose a differential privacy (DP) based PFL (DP-PFL) framework and analyze its convergence performance. Specifically, we first design a privacy budget allocation scheme for inner and outer update stages based on the Rényi DP composition theory. Then, we develop two convergence bounds for the proposed DP-PFL framework under convex and non-convex loss function assumptions, respectively. Our developed convergence bounds reveal that 1) there is an optimal size of the DP-PFL model that can achieve the best convergence performance for a given privacy level, and 2) there is an optimal tradeoff among the number of communication rounds, convergence performance and privacy budget. Evaluations on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our theoretical results are consistent with experimental results. The derived theoretical results can guide the design of various DP-PFL algorithms with configurable tradeoff requirements on the convergence performance and privacy levels.}

While data are widely used, data providers worry that their privacy will be infringed, so the security of the data has also received more attention. Private set intersection (PSI) allows two data-owning parties to jointly compute the intersection of private datasets. The party cannot obtain any other information except for the intersection results. However, Bloom filter (BF) is a naive solution that can be used to potentially obtain PSI, but the verifiability of using BF is usually a concern for effectiveness. Hence, garbled Bloom filter is indeed expected to overcome this concern in two-party setting. We aim for the outsourced scenario where there are many data-owning parties in distributed setting. These parties would like to jointly obtain the set intersection in a private manner supported by an outsourced cloud, and further to obtain data integration. The main challenges are that the previous solutions cannot be directly transformed into an outsourced scenario. In this paper, the proposed joint and effective privacy preserving outsourced set intersection and data integration protocols are called\nJEDI\n. They are generic constructions. We start by introducing a basic outsourced PSI protocol from the cryptographic building blocks and new BF and GBF techniques. Then, we modify the basic protocol and propose the full-fledged scheme to achieve an outsourced multi-party PSI protocol. Finally, we analyze the security and execution efficiency aspects to ensure usability.}

	abstract = {With the increasing electricity consumption and the wide application of renewable energy sources, energy auction attracts a lot of attention due to its economic benefits. In recent years, much research employs double auction mechanisms to design a market model for smart grid and shows its paramount importance for energy trading. However, few of them are able to quickly and securely identify the potential winner or winners from all sealed bids and asks throughout the auction process. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-user threshold equality retrieval (MTER) by a novel non-interactive threshold public key encryption with equality test (T-PKEET) as a building block for bid-ask filtering to help different double auction mechanisms be implemented effectively in the smart grid. In this new T-PKEET primitive, the key used to authorize the equality test is shared among\nn\nservers so that at least\nk\nservers are collaborated to compute the test function: a combiner who has a user\nU\n’s ciphertext\nC\nand another user\nU\nˆ\n’s ciphertext\nC\nˆ\nwishes to carry out the equality test on ciphertexts\nC\nand\nC\nˆ\n. Preferably, T-PKEET solves a challenge problem of resisting against message recovery attack in PKEET system. We construct a concrete T-PKEET scheme with flexible authorization by issuing tag-based test key shares and ciphertext-based test key shares and prove it to achieve st-IND-CCA2 security against insider adversary in the standard model. The experimental results show that the Trapdoor and Test algorithms of T-PKEET scheme have significant efficiency, whose cost is only 8.46% and 17.78% that of the work closest to ours. Therefore, our construction can effectively facilitate demand responses of the filtering on sealed bids and asks for double auction in smart grid.}

	abstract = {Recognition of known malicious patterns through signature-based systems is unsuccessful against malware for which no known signature exists to identify them. These include not only zero-day but also known malicious software able to self-replicate rewriting its own code leaving unaffected its execution, namely metamorphic malware. YARA is a popular malware analysis tool that uses the so-called YARA-rules, which are built to match malicious contents within files or network packets analyzed by an Anti-Virus engine. Sometimes such content is expressed in the form of a byte-signature, i.e., a sequence of operational machine-level code. However, these can be bypassed since malware obfuscation techniques can change these sequences, rewriting them in several equivalent forms. This paper presents YAMME, a YARA-byte-signatures Metamorphic Mutation Engine to strengthen rules against some malware obfuscation techniques deployed in metamorphic mutation engines. First, it rewrites YARA-bye-signatures in several equivalent ways, as a metamorphic mutation engine would do. Second, an optimization phase exploits the YARA-rules syntax constructs to provide several rules formats, making them suitable for different real-world application requirements. YAMME rules have been evaluated on MWOR, G2, NGVCK, and MetaNG datasets, resulting in a better detection rate than that achieved by YARA-rules generated through AutoYara. Furthermore, an analysis of computational overhead required by different YAMME rules formats validates the low impact introduced by the mutation engine at the YARA-rules level.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role in radio surveillance to decipher malicious messages, thanks to their flexibility, mobility, and likely line-of-sight (LoS) to ground targets. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can potentially create radio surveillance channels towards the UAVs by passively configuring the radio environments without raising suspicion. This paper presents a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven framework for radio surveillance, where a fixed-wing UAV is employed to acquire the radio fingerprint of a suspicious transmitter (Tx) with the aid of a benign RIS. A new Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) model is designed to allow the UAV to learn its trajectory and the RIS configuration based on its observed transmit rate of the suspicious Tx, eliminating the need for channel state information to and from the RIS. The novel contributions include the consideration of the fixed-wing UAV, and the action and reward designed to capture the mobility constraint of the UAV. Simulations demonstrate that the new approach offers the UAV monitor an exceptional and reliable radio surveillance capability, while keeping a desired distance from the UAV to the Tx. The use of the RIS allows for significant improvements of over 37% and 59% in the eavesdropping success probability and average eavesdropping rate, respectively.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. To expand the usage scenarios of DL-based methods, federated learning (FL) allows multiple users to train a global model on the basis of respecting individual data privacy. However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose two privacy evaluation metrics designed for FL-based NIDSs, including (1) privacy score that evaluates the similarity between the original and recovered traffic features using reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using adversarial attack with the recovered traffic. We conduct experiments to illustrate that existing defenses provide little protection and the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based NIDS, we further propose FedDef, a novel optimization-based input perturbation defense strategy with theoretical guarantee. It achieves both high utility by minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing the input distance. We experimentally evaluate four existing defenses on four datasets and show that our defense outperforms all the baselines in terms of privacy protection with up to 7 times higher privacy score, while maintaining model accuracy loss within 3% under optimal parameter combination.}

	abstract = {Considering a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS)-aided dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) system, this paper proposes a symbol-level precoding-based scheme for concurrent securing confidential information transmission and performing target sensing, where the public signals intended for multiple unclassified users are exploited to deceive the multiple potential malicious radar targets. Specifically, the STAR-RIS-aided DFRC system design is formulated as a joint optimization problem that determines the transmission waveform signal, the transmission and reflection coefficients of STAR-RIS. The objective is to maximize the average received radar sensing power subject to the quality-of-service constraints for multiple communication users, the security constraint for multiple potential eavesdroppers, as well as various practical waveform design restrictions. However, the formulated problem is challenging to handle due to its nonconvexity. Furthermore, the high dimensionality of the optimization variables also renders existing optimization algorithms inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a distance-majorization induced low-complexity algorithm to obtain an efficient solution, which converts the nonconvex joint design problem into a sequence of subproblems that can be solved in closed-form, relieving the required high computational burden of the conventional approaches, e.g., the interior point method. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the STAR-RIS in improving the DFRC performance. Besides, by comparing with the state-of-the-art alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, simulation results validate the efficiency of our proposed optimization algorithm and show that it enjoys excellent scalability for different number of T-R elements equipped at the STAR-RIS.}

	abstract = {Currently, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF), which describes the physical layer features of wireless signals in time-frequency domain, has been intensively studied. However, the research of polarization fingerprint (PF), which describes the physical layer features of wireless signals in the polarization domain, has just started. In this paper, PF is deeply studied, and a PF-based LoRaWAN physical layer authentication solution is designed under the actual application scenario. Firstly, the physical layer features in polarization are analyzed from the full path of polarization formation, propagation and reception, and the mathematical model of PF is constructed. There exist two main properties in PF: frequency characteristic and spatial characteristic. The spatial characteristic is the unique property of PF compared with RFF, which significantly improves the fingerprint discrimination of the same type of device. Subsequently, the solution has two authentication mechanisms according to different deployment strategies of LoRa devices: polarization fingerprint identification (PFI) based authentication and PF tracking-based authentication. PFI is implemented based on ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN), which assigns different weights to parts of PF with different discrimination to improve identification accuracy. PF tracking-based authentication solves the impact of LoRa device movement on authentication. Finally, the authentication performance and robustness of the solution are evaluated by experiments, and the ability of the solution to deal with typical attacks is analyzed. In summary, the PF-based LoRaWAN physical layer authentication solution provides considerable application potential.}

	abstract = {There are two main security concerns in outsourcing computations. One is how to protect the privacy of the outsourced data, and the other is how to ensure the correctness of the outsourced computations. Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) schemes allow a client to store a set of private data on two servers and then offload a computation on the data to servers. Such schemes ensure that each individual server learns no information about the data. While HSS schemes that allow the client to use a secret key to verify the correctness of the computation results exist and relieve both security concerns, the current literature lacks a publicly verifiable HSS scheme for polynomial evaluations. In this paper, we consider a two-server publicly verifiable HSS (PVHSS) model, where any third party can use a public key to perform verifications. We propose both a basic construction and an improved construction of PVHSS for evaluating polynomials. Our PVHSS ensures that no single server is able to learn any information about the outsourced data or persuade the verifier to accept a wrong result. We also implement the proposed scheme. For polynomials of degree\n≤20\n, our experiments show that: 1) the proposed PVHSS is\n2×\n-\n144×\nfaster than the existing non-verifiable or privately verifiable HSS on the server-side; 2) the proposed PVHSS is friendly to resource-restricted clients and takes less than\n27ms\nto reconstruct and verify the results.}

In particular, the selected users emit interfering signals via an orthogonal resource dedicated to the covert user together with signals for their own communications using orthogonal resources allocated to the selected users, which helps the covert user hide the presence of the covert communication. For the covert communication scheme, we carry out extensive analysis and find system parameters in closed forms. The analytic derivation for the system parameters allows one to find the optimal combination of system parameters by performing a simple one-dimensional search. In addition, the analytic results elucidate relations among the system parameters. In particular, it will be proved that the optimal strategy for the non-covert users is an on-off scheme with equal transmit power. The theoretical results derived in this work are confirmed by comparing them with numerical results obtained with exhaustive searches. Finally, we demonstrate that the results of work can be utilized in versatile ways by demonstrating a design of covert communication with energy efficiency into account.}

	abstract = {Aggregate signatures enable the sensor nodes of Industrial Internet of Things to send their signatures to the aggregator to realize signature compression. Before being stored in the data center, sensitive data and non-sensitive data should adopt different data processing methods in the process of sensor data fusion. In the high security analysis scenario of Industrial Internet of Things, only the verifier with a specified high security level can verify the resulting aggregate signature. So far, no one has explored how to ensure sensitive data privacy in the designated-verifier aggregate signatures. Motivated by it, this paper proposes a designated-verifier aggregate signature scheme (named DVAS) based on permissioned blockchain to achieve sensitive data privacy. In this scheme, the aggregator can be used not only to aggregate signatures, but also to sanitize data. Through smart contracts, the aggregator can sanitize the sensitive data according to the contract, and convert the original signature of the sensitive data into a valid signature. Therefore, DVAS can achieve elastic sensitive data privacy, not limited to encryption operations. The security attributes of DVAS include conditional anonymity, unforgeability, immutability and protecting data privacy. At the same time, DVAS realizes accountability through signature verification. Finally, the formal security proof, performance evaluation and experiments indicate that DVAS is secure, effective and practical for Industrial Internet of Things.}

	abstract = {With the continuous development of sensor technology, more and more users hope to monitor and collect information in a certain area safely and efficiently by deploying heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs). However, nodes in HWSNs have limited capabilities, which leads to many security challenges. Existing data transmission schemes in HWSNs take measures to resist these security threats, which aggravate the node computation overhead and increase the network energy consumption. This paper proposes a Lightweight and Secure Data Transmission (LSDT) scheme against malicious nodes in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Firstly, considering node capabilities limitations in HWSNs, we design a lightweight secret sharing scheme based on XOR operation, which maps data to multiple shares and makes it convenient to transmit shares separately to the sink node via multiple paths. While guaranteeing data security, this scheme can greatly reduce the computation overhead of nodes compared with traditional secret sharing schemes. Further, during the delivery of shares, the network may be attacked by malicious nodes, causing the interruption of message transmission. Therefore, we design a malicious node detection and feedback mechanism, which can quickly respond to malicious node attacks and update the reputation degree of malicious nodes. Finally, we propose a routing selection scheme based on reference path which comprehensively considers the energy and reputation degree of heterogeneous nodes. It makes message transmission bypass malicious nodes while achieving network energy load balance, significantly extending the network lifetime. The security analysis proves that our scheme guarantees the security of data transmission. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our scheme has significant advantages over the existing HWSNs data transmission schemes in terms of network lifetime extension and malicious node resistance.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a data-efficient detection method for deep neural networks against backdoor attacks under a black-box scenario. The proposed approach is motivated by the intuition that features corresponding to triggers have a higher influence in determining the backdoored network output than any other benign features. To quantitatively measure the effects of triggers and benign features on determining the backdoored network output, we introduce five metrics. To calculate the five-metric values for a given input, we first generate several synthetic samples by injecting the input’s partial contents into clean validation samples. Then, the five metrics are computed by using the output labels of the corresponding synthetic samples. One contribution of this work is the use of a tiny clean validation dataset. Having the computed five metrics, five novelty detectors are trained from the validation dataset. A meta novelty detector fuses the output of the five trained novelty detectors to generate a meta confidence score. During online testing, our method determines if online samples are poisoned or not via assessing their meta confidence scores output by the meta novelty detector. We show the efficacy of our methodology through a broad range of backdoor attacks, including ablation studies and comparison to existing approaches. Our methodology is promising since the proposed five metrics quantify the inherent differences between clean and poisoned samples. Additionally, our detection method can be incrementally improved by appending more metrics that may be proposed to address future advanced attacks.

	abstract = {Deep hashing has been intensively studied and successfully applied in large-scale image retrieval systems due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models, that is, adversarial vulnerability. Notably, it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning, and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover, current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper, we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically, we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly, our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner, where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover, adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features, the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further, we, for the first time, formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms, meanwhile, the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

	abstract = {The novel technology based on reinforcement learning (RL) is considered as a promising direction to achieve cognitive and even intelligent anti-jamming communication. However, traditional RL converges slowly in the face of huge state-action space, while the performance improvement of deep RL depends on high-cost computing resources. Under unknown and dynamic malicious jamming attacks, it is still a major challenge to realize online anti-jamming communication through fast and autonomous learning. In this paper, we propose a fast anti-jamming scheme based on intra-domain knowledge reuse for distributed wireless networks. First, we introduce the Bisimulation Relation to measure the similarity of different state-action pairs in the communication anti-jamming problem, so as to build a bridge of knowledge reuse between state-action pairs. This similarity stems from the fact that the anti-jamming problem can be divided into two categories according to whether it successfully resists jamming attacks, in which different state-action pairs in the same category have similarities. Then, through the real-time update and reuse of state-action values, each node can independently learn the characteristics of dynamic environment and adjust the transmission strategy quickly, so as to avoid external malicious jamming and internal mutual interference. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly accelerates the convergence speed and improves the network normalized throughput compared with the benchmark against unknown and dynamic jamming, and has remarkable agility and jamming memory.}

	abstract = {A secure storage code maps\nK\nsource symbols, each of\nL\nw\nbits, to\nN\ncoded symbols, each of\nL\nv\nbits, such that each coded symbol is stored in a node of a graph (one may view a node as a server). Each edge of the graph is either associated with\nD\nof the\nK\nsource symbols such that from the pair of nodes connected by the edge, we can decode the\nD\nsource symbols and learn no information about the remaining\nK−D\nsource symbols; or the edge is associated with no source symbols such that from the pair of nodes connected by the edge, nothing about the\nK\nsource symbols is revealed. The ratio\nL\nw\n/\nL\nv\nis called the symbol rate of a secure storage code and the highest possible symbol rate is called the capacity. We characterize all graphs over which the capacity of a secure storage code is equal to 1, when\nD=1\n. This result is generalized to\nD>1\n, i.e., we characterize all graphs over which the capacity of a secure storage code is equal to\n1/D\nunder a mild condition that for any node, the source symbols associated with each of its connected edges do not include a common element. Further, we characterize all graphs over which the capacity of a secure storage code is equal to\n2/D\n.}

	abstract = {Steganography is an important technology for ensuring the security of cyberspace and the privacy of communications. In the last decade, emerging biotechnology has made it possible for DNA to be used as a promising steganographic carrier with high hidden capacity, high imperceptibility and high feasibility. However, severe statistical distortion might appear in steganographic carriers generated by existing DNA steganographies when they are compared with the natural ones. Therefore, efforts are being made to seek an advanced strategy to generate quasi-natural steganographic carriers with a strong anti-steganalysis capability. In this work, we first thoroughly analyze and model the numerous complicated statistical properties that exist in natural DNA chains, and then utilize the LSTM model to learn the serialized statistical properties. After obtaining an optimal sequence model that highly satisfies the statistical properties of natural DNA chains, we utilize the Adaptive Dynamic Grouping (ADG) algorithm to perform information hiding. In addition, we have carried out experimental analysis and verification from the perspectives of perceptual-imperceptibility, statistical-imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capability, all of which show that our proposed steganography method vastly outperforms previous DNA steganographic methods, taking a successful step towards achieving higher security DNA steganography.}

However, NTRU and its variants suffer from several drawbacks, including difficulties in achieving worst-case correctness error in a moderate modulus, inconvenient sampling distributions for messages, and relatively slower algorithms compared to other lattice-based schemes. In this work, we propose a new NTRU-based key encapsulation mechanism (\nKEM\n), called\nNTRU+\n, which overcomes nearly all existing drawbacks.\nNTRU+\nis constructed based on two new generic transformations:\nACWC\n2\nand\nFO\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n⊥\n(a variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform).\nACWC\n2\nis used to easily achieve worst-case correctness error, while\nFO\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n⊥\nis used to achieve chosen-ciphertext security without re-encryption. Both\nACWC\n2\nand\nFO\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n¯\n⊥\nare defined using a randomness-recovery algorithm and an encoding method. In particular, our simple encoding method, the semi-generalized one-time pad (\nSOTP\n), allows us to sample a message from a natural bit-string space with an arbitrary distribution. We provide four parameter sets for\nNTRU+\nand present implementation results using NTT-friendly rings over cyclotomic trinomials.}

	abstract = {The availability of handy multi-modal (i.e., RGB-D) sensors has brought about a surge of face anti-spoofing research. However, the current multi-modal face presentation attack detection (PAD) has two defects: (1) The framework based on multi-modal fusion requires providing modalities consistent with the training input, which seriously limits the deployment scenario. (2) The performance of ConvNet-based model on high fidelity datasets is increasingly limited. In this work, we present a pure transformer-based framework, dubbed the Flexible Modal Vision Transformer (FM-ViT), for face anti-spoofing to flexibly target any single-modal (i.e., RGB) attack scenarios with the help of available multi-modal data. Specifically, FM-ViT retains a specific branch for each modality to capture different modal information and introduces the Cross-Modal Transformer Block (CMTB), which consists of two cascaded attentions named Multi-headed Mutual-Attention (MMA) and Fusion-Attention (MFA) to guide each modal branch to mine potential features from informative patch tokens, and to learn modality-agnostic liveness features by enriching the modal information of own CLS token, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that the single model trained based on FM-ViT can not only flexibly evaluate different modal samples, but also outperforms existing single-modal frameworks by a large margin, and approaches the multi-modal frameworks introduced with smaller FLOPs and model parameters.}

In this paradigm, the privacy of model owners and users should be considered. Existing solutions focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but their efficiency is much lower than GALA, which is a solution that only protects user privacy. Furthermore, these solutions adopt approximations that reduce the model accuracy and thus require model owners to retrain the models. In this paper, we present an efficient CNN inference outsourcing solution that protects the privacy of both model owners and users. Specifically, we design secure two-party computation protocols based on two non-colluding cloud servers, which calculate with additive secret shares of the model and the user’s input. Our protocols avoid the expensive permutation operations in linear calculations and approximations in non-linear calculations. We implement our solution on realistic CNNs and experimental results show that our solution is even 2–4 times faster than GALA.}

	abstract = {Data sharing is an integral part of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which provide drivers with safe and comfortable driving environments. However, when data are shared among multiple vehicles, they must be encrypted multiple times. Some solutions have used identity-based broadcast encryption to solve this problem. However, these schemes have two major limitations. First, the decryption cost is linearly related to the number of data receivers, where the identity of other receivers must be known. Second, only the data sender can forward the data. To address these important deficiencies, we propose an identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption scheme to realize flexible and efficient data-sharing in VANETs. The data sender generates a fixed ciphertext that can be obtained by newly added vehicles through authorized vehicles. Data receivers can decrypt ciphertext directly without knowing the identities of other receivers, where the decryption overhead is constant. In addition, our scheme can achieve complete anonymous data sharing to protect vehicle privacy. A security proof shows that our scheme has sufficient security, and a performance analysis shows that our scheme performs well. Our proposed scheme is thus suitable for securing VANETs.}

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the abundance of personal data has led to the rapid development of machine learning models and important advances in artificial intelligence (AI). However, alongside all the achievements, there are increasing privacy threats and security risks that may cause significant losses for data providers. Recent legislation requires that the private information about a user should be removed from a database as well as machine learning models upon certain deletion requests. While erasing data records from memory storage is straightforward, it is often challenging to remove the influence of particular data samples from a model that has already been trained. Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm that aims to make machine learning models “forget” what they have learned about particular data. Nevertheless, the unlearning issue for federated learning has not been completely addressed due to its special working mode. First, existing solutions crucially rely on retraining-based model calibration, which is likely unavailable and can pose new privacy risks for federated learning frameworks. Second, today’s efficient unlearning strategies are mainly designed for convex problems, which are incapable of handling more complicated learning tasks like neural networks. To overcome these limitations, we took advantage of differential privacy and developed an efficient machine unlearning algorithm named FedRecovery. The FedRecovery erases the impact of a client by removing a weighted sum of gradient residuals from the global model, and tailors the Gaussian noise to make the unlearned model and retrained model statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, the algorithm neither requires retraining-based fine-tuning nor needs the assumption of convexity. Theoretical analyses show the rigorous indistinguishability guarantee. Additionally, the experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the FedRecovery is efficient and is able to produce a model that performs similarly to the retrained one.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the deployment of fully supervised gait recognition. However, due to domain diversity, gait recognition models designed under the fully supervised condition suffer from poor generalization in unseen domains. How to improve the generalization ability of gait recognition models and enhance their performance on unseen domains is unexplored in existing gait recognition approaches. This paper investigates the generalizable gait recognition problem and proposes a Progressive Sub-domain Information Mining (PSIM) framework for single-source generalizable gait recognition. During training, the PSIM can mine sub-domain information from a single large-scale source domain by differentiating gait features extracted from different people through unsupervised clustering. Then, domain information mitigation loss and domain homogenization loss are introduced to regularize those gait features to be domain-insensitive. The above procedures are conducted iteratively until the model converges. The PSIM framework is model-agnostic, which can directly improve the generalization ability of state-of-the-art gait recognition models without significantly increasing the complexity of the model. In experiments, our model-agnostic PSIM framework is adopted on several gait recognition models to show its effectiveness in boosting gait recognition performance for the single-source generalizable gait recognition task.}

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN), which is used for communication between in-vehicle devices, has been shown to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Voltage-based spoofing detection (VBS-D) mechanisms are considered state-of-the-art solutions, complementing cryptography-based authentication whose security is limited due to the CAN protocol’s limited message size. Unfortunately, VBS-D mechanisms are vulnerable to poisoning performed by a malicious device connected to the CAN bus, specifically designed to poison the deployed VBS-D mechanism as it adapts to environmental changes that take place when the vehicle is moving. In this paper, we harden VBS-D mechanisms using a deep learning-based mechanism which runs immediately, when the vehicle starts; this mechanism utilizes physical side-channels to detect and locate physical intrusions, even when the malicious devices connected to the CAN bus are silent. We demonstrate the mechanism’s effectiveness (100% intrusion detection accuracy and error rates of close to 0%) in various physical intrusion scenarios and varying temperatures on a CAN bus prototype. In addition, we present a deep learning-based VBS-D mechanism that securely adapts to environmental changes. This mechanism’s robustness (99.8% device identification accuracy) is demonstrated on a real moving vehicle.}

	abstract = {Privacy image classification (PIC) has attracted increasing attention as it can help people make appropriate privacy decisions when sharing images. Most recently, some pioneer research efforts have been made to utilize multimodal information for PIC, since multi-modality can provide richer information than single modality. Those research efforts on multimodal PIC are under the assumption of independently identically distribution. However, connections between different modalities commonly exist in real-world cases. Taking the modalities of scene and object as example, in the scene of ‘library/indoor’, the object ‘book jacket’ resides with high probabilities. To this end, in this paper, a novel PIC approach, called CoupledPIC, is proposed to bridge this gap by comprehensively capturing the coupling relations between different modalities. In CoupledPIC, two submodules are designed to capture explicit and implicit coupling relations between different modalities respectively. The explicit modality coupling is learned with a tensor fusion networks based submodule, via the direct interaction of features. For the implicit modality coupling, a graph convolutional networks based submodule is proposed to learn on both the initial graphs and attention guided graphs, via information aggregation on graphs. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark, PicAlert, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CoupledPIC, yielding significant improvement by modeling inter-modality coupling information.}

Given these observations, we propose PKDGA, a partial knowledge-based domain generation algorithm with high anti-detection ability and high practicality. PKDGA employs the reinforcement learning architecture, which makes it evolve automatically based only on the easily-observable feedback from detectors. We evaluate PKDGA using a comprehensive set of real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that it reduces the detection performance of existing detectors from 91.7% to 52.5%. We further apply PKDGA to the Mirai malware, and the evaluations show that the proposed method is quite lightweight and time-efficient.}

	abstract = {Due to the widespread use of text in cyberspace, linguistic steganography, which hides secret information into normal texts, develops quickly in these years. While linguistic steganography protects users’ privacy, it also has the risk of being abused to endanger network security. Therefore, its corresponding detection technology, namely linguistic steganalysis, has attracted more and more researchers’ attention in the past several years. However, most of the current linguistic steganalysis methods rely heavily on a large number of labeled samples, which presents a significant gap from real-world scenarios where labeled steganographic samples are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we proposed the Pre-trained Language model with Self-training for Few-shot Linguistic Steganalysis (LSFLS) method which effectively copes with few-shot linguistic steganalysis through a small number of labeled samples and some auxiliary unlabeled samples. Numerous experiments have proved that the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy of linguistic steganalysis when only a few labeled samples are provided (even less than 10), significantly improving the detection ability of existing methods in few-shot scenario. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain good detection capability in the case of data source mismatch and label unbalance. We believe that our work will greatly advance the practical application of linguistic steganalysis techniques.}

This manuscript describes a privacy-preserving protocol that enables WSN nodes to jointly compute an arbitrary function without disclosing their own private inputs. The computation takes place at data source nodes, while computation instructions and intermediate results move across the network secured by cryptography. The protocol relies on the Onion Routing technique to provide uniformly distributed network traffic and confine the knowledge a foreign actor can gain from monitoring messages traveling the network. We show that the communication protocol is privacy-preserving against the external and internal attacker models, and we validate our protocol implementation using the NS3 network simulator.}

	abstract = {Link flooding attacks (LFAs) have always been a security concern as the impact of volumetric attacks on transit links are increasingly severe. Capacity expansion, while being effective in combating LFAs, involves considerable deployment costs. Therefore, how to efficiently manage the link resource among spatio-temporal dynamic customers remains a challenge for Internet service providers (ISPs). In this paper, we study the differential pricing strategy for bandwidth allocation with LFA resilience by leveraging a multi-leader-multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game approach. Based on network capabilities, we employ pricing approaches instead of empirical assignments to regulate the privileged channel allocation, economically facilitating the domain-level resource coordination. And we formulate the bandwidth pricing and allocation decision problem by using a Stackelberg game-theoretic approach to capture the interactions between providers and customers. Then, we analyze the Stackelberg game equilibrium of uniform pricing strategy and differential pricing strategy, where differential pricing is applied to adjust the prices that individual customers receive according to heterogeneous factors. Furthermore, we give the optimal solution derivation in the case of differential pricing. By comparing with other relevant pricing strategies, our numerical results show that the differential pricing strategy achieves congestion-free property and provides enough incentives for ISPs to deploy.}

	abstract = {Against spatial memory violations threatening a vast amount of legacy software, various safety solutions have been suggested for decades. However, their practical uses have been impeded by diverse reasons, such as significant overheads and mandatory modifications of existing architectures. Accordingly, there has been a clear need for a practical safety solution that is fast enough and yet runs on commodity systems for its wide applicability in the field. As an effort to meet this need, a major processor vendor, ARM, recently announced a hardware extension, called Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), that helps engineers to implement efficient safety solutions. However, due to lack of hardware tags to isolate all data objects, MTE either resorts to a probabilistic memory safety guarantee, which is susceptible to a security loophole, or suffers from severe performance degradation to guarantee deterministic security. The aim of our work is to develop a MTE-based deterministic spatial safety solution, called ZOMETAG, with high efficiency by capitalizing on salient architectural features. Our key idea for fast, deterministic safety is to somehow assign permanently all objects unique tags throughout program execution. For this, ZOMETAG first divides the data memory into a number of small regions, called zones, and distributes data objects over the zones subject to certain constraints (to be discussed later). Then, we extend the notion of a tag in a way that each object stored with MTE tag $t$ in zone $z$ is uniquely assigned the zone-tag pair < $z$ , $t$ > as a new tag. To work with this new tag assignment, we devise a novel mechanism, called two-layer isolation, that is basically a combination of MTE-based tagging (for one-layer of isolation) with zone-based tagging (for the other) both of which collaborate together to ensure spatial safety for all objects by preventing a pointer currently assigned one zone-tag pair from erroneously referring to objects assigned different pairs. Our experimental results are quite encouraging. ZOMETAG enforces deterministic spatial safety with overheads of 35% in SPEC CPU2006 and merely of 6% in real world applications like nginx.}

	abstract = {With the prevalence of outsourced computation, such as Machine Learning as a Service, protecting the privacy of sensitive data throughout the whole computation is a critical yet challenging task. The problem becomes even more tricky when multiple sources of input and/or multiple recipients of output are involved, who would encrypt/decrypt data using different keys. Considering many computation tasks demand binary operands and operations but there are only outsourced computation constructions for arithmetic calculations, in this paper, the authors propose a privacy-preserving outsourced computation framework for Boolean circuits. The proposed framework can protect sensitive data throughout the whole computation, i.e., input, output and all the intermediate values, ensuring privacy for general outsourced tasks. Moreover, it compresses the ciphertext domain of Liu et al., (2016) and attains secure protocols for four logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, and XOR) which are the basic operations in Boolean circuits. With the proposed framework as a building block, a novel Privacy-preserved (encrypted) Bloom Filter and a Multi-keyword Searchable Encryption scheme under the multi-user setting are presented. Security proof and experimental results show that the proposal is reliable and practical.}

	abstract = {Contactless palmprint recognition, an emerging biometric technology, has attracted increasing attention due to its noninvasive and high practicability characteristics. Although it is naturally suitable for mobile application scenarios, the following two challenges severely limit its recognition performance: 1) the inconsistency in acquisition devices used in training and testing, and 2) many subjects are unable to be imaged on each device, resulting in incomplete data problems. To address these issues, we propose a self-paced CycleGAN with self-attention modules, which simultaneously synthesizes missing data and alleviates the influence of different imaging devices. Specifically, we develop CycleGAN with self-attention modules to generate missing training data by effectively mining the structural correlation among samples while capturing the cross-domain features. Furthermore, a self-paced learning strategy, which is a human cognitive-driven learning mechanism, is used to guide learning the robust cross-domain feature representation and recognition model, by which the relatively easy learning samples are gradually involved in the training process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on contactless palmprint datasets collected using different smartphones. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying contactless palmprint images.}

To tackle above issues, we are inspired by cloze tests in language education and propose a novel approach named Visual Cloze Completion (VCC), which conducts VAD by completing visual cloze tests (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first localizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC). To realize both precise and comprehensive event extraction, appearance and motion are used as complementary cues to mark the object region associated with each event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is extracted from several neighboring frames and stacked into a STC. With each patch and the patch sequence of a STC regarded as a visual “word” and “sentence” respectively, we deliberately erase a certain “word” (patch) to yield a VCT. Then, the VCT is completed by training DNNs to infer the erased patch and its optical flow via video semantics. Meanwhile, VCC fully exploits temporal context by alternatively erasing each patch in temporal context and creating multiple VCTs. Furthermore, we propose localization-level, event-level, model-level and decision-level solutions to enhance VCC, which can further exploit VCC’s potential and produce significant VAD performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VCC achieves highly competitive VAD performance.}

To address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a new concept called attribute-based authenticated encryption with keyword search (ABAEKS) and proposes an efficient ABAEKS scheme. Our ABAEKS has low end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and (insider) KGA.

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in distributed learning tasks with privacy requirements. However, it has been discovered that FL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The typical gradient inversion attacks primarily focus on attempting to obtain the client’s private input in a white-box manner, where the adversary is assumed to be either the client or the server. However, if both the clients and the server are honest and fully trusted, is the FL secure? In this paper, we propose a novel method called External Gradient Inversion Attack (EGIA) in the grey-box settings. Specifically, we concentrate on the point that public-shared gradients in FL are always transmitted through the intermediary nodes, which has been widely ignored. On this basis, we demonstrate that an external adversary can reconstruct the private input using gradients even if both the clients and the server are honest and fully trusted. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the black-box attack scenario in which the adversary has only the gradients. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to test the effectiveness of EGIA. The outcomes of our experiments validate that the EGIA method is highly effective.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to train a unified model without disclosing their private data. However, susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs) arises due to the natural inclination of FL models to overfit on the training data during the training process, thereby enabling MIAs to exploit the subtle differences in the FL model’s parameters, activations, or predictions between the training and testing data to infer membership information. It is worth noting that most if not all existing MIAs against FL require access to the model’s internal information or modification of the training process, yielding them unlikely to be performed in practice. In this paper, we present with TEAR the first evidence that it is possible for an honest-but-curious federated client to perform MIA against an FL system, by exploring the Temporal Evolution of the Adversarial Robustness between the training and non-training data. We design a novel adversarial example generation method to quantify the target sample’s adversarial robustness, which can be utilized to obtain the membership features to train the inference model in a supervised manner. Extensive experiment results on five realistic datasets demonstrate that TEAR can achieve a strong inference performance compared with two existing MIAs, and is able to escape from the protection of two representative defenses.}

	abstract = {Machine learning and neural networks have become increasingly popular solutions for encrypted malware traffic detection. They mine and learn complex traffic patterns, enabling detection by fitting boundaries between malware traffic and benign traffic. Compared with signature-based methods, they have higher scalability and flexibility. However, affected by the frequent variants and updates of malware, current methods suffer from a high false positive rate and do not work well for unknown malware traffic detection. It remains a critical task to achieve effective malware traffic detection. In this paper, we introduce CBSeq to address the above problems. CBSeq is a method that constructs a stable traffic representation, behavior sequence, to characterize attacking intent and achieve malware traffic detection. We novelly propose the channels with similar behavior as the detection object and extract side-channel content to construct behavior sequence. Unlike benign activities, the behavior sequences of malware and its variant’s traffic exhibit solid internal correlations. Moreover, we design the MSFormer, a powerful Transformer-based multi-sequence fusion classifier. It captures the internal similarity of behavior sequence, thereby distinguishing malware traffic from benign traffic. Our evaluations demonstrate that CBSeq performs effectively in various known malware traffic detection and exhibits superior performance in unknown malware traffic detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.}

The polarity map of deblocking errors can work well in modulating handcrafted embedding costs. However, it may not be easy to design an optimal deblocking method that is universal to enhance security for all images, and it is unclear how to better utilize the polarity map in modulating statistical model-based embedding costs. To circumvent the difficulty of deblocking method design, we propose an optimal polarity map selection (OPMS) method leveraging existing well-performed deblocking methods. OPMS is designed based on polarity-oriented synthetic stego and minimum feature distance, so that the selected optimal polarity map (OPM) ensures a high security performance to each image. Besides, we propose a statistical model-based modulation method to better exploiting OPM in a quaternary quantized Gaussian embedding (QQGE) model. Through shifting the mean of the distribution, QQGE can derive effective modulated embedding probabilities and reduce the number of modified coefficients without increasing coding complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overall steganographic method, called OPMS-QQGE, greatly surpasses existing state-of-the-art SIE-based methods in resisting both CNN-based and feature-based steganalyzers.}

It is critical to perturb the latent information while maintaining the utility of the data, which, unfortunately, has never been addressed. This paper presents a novel approach to obfuscating the latent information and maximizing the utility. Specifically, we first analyze the graph Fourier transform (GFT) basis that captures the latent graph structures, and the latent stimuli that are the spectral-domain inputs to the latent graphs. Then, we formulate and decouple a new multi-objective problem to alternately obfuscate the GFT basis and stimuli. The difference-of-convex (DC) programming and Stiefel manifold gradient descent are orchestrated to obfuscate the GFT basis. The DC programming and gradient descent are employed to perturb the spectral-domain stimuli. Experiments conducted on an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder dataset demonstrate that our approach can substantially outperform its differential privacy-based benchmark in the face of the latest graph inference attacks.}

	abstract = {Existing Android malware detection methods are usually hard to simultaneously resist various obfuscation techniques. Therefore, bytecode-based code obfuscation becomes an effective means to circumvent Android malware analysis. Building obfuscation-resilient Android malware analysis methods is a challenging task, due to the fact that various obfuscation techniques have vastly different effects on code and detection features. To mitigate this problem, we propose combining multiple features that are complementary in combating code obfuscation. Accordingly, we develop an obfuscation-resilient Android malware analysis method CorDroid, based on two new features: Enhanced Sensitive Function Call Graph (E-SFCG) and Opcode-based Markov transition Matrix (OMM). The first describes sensitive function call relationships, while the second reflects transition probabilities among opcodes. Combining E-SFCG and OMM can well characterize the runtime behavior of Android apps from different perspectives, hence increasing the difficulty of misleading malware analysis through using code obfuscation to affect detection features. To evaluate CorDroid, we generate 74, 138 obfuscated samples with 14 different obfuscation techniques, and compare CorDroid with the state-of-the-art detection methods (e.g., MaMaDroid, RevealDroid and APIGraph). In terms of average F1-Score, CorDroid is 29.69% higher than MaMaDroid, 21.80% higher than APIGraph, and 9.71% higher than RevealDroid, respectively. Experiments also validate the complementarity between E-SFCG and OMM, and exhibit the high execution efficiency of CorDroid.}

	abstract = {The revelations about massive surveillance have created significant interest in algorithm substitution attack (ASA), where an honest implementation of a cryptographic primitive is replaced by a subverted one which can help “big brother” to break cryptographic security while generating output indistinguishable from the honest output. The current known ASAs on public-key cryptography are either dedicated for a type of concrete constructions with specific internal, or restrictive when applying to the real-word cryptographic standards (Ateniese et al., ACM CCS’15; Russell et al., ACM CCS’17; Chen et al., ASIACRYPT’20). In this paper, we first present a practical undetectable substitution for a general randomized algorithm with certain structure such that the randomness can be revealed to the big brother. Then, instantiating this randomized algorithm, we present a series of ASAs on core primitives in public-key cryptography including public-key encryption, key encapsulation mechanism, key exchange, and digital signature. In particular, our ASAs are universal in the sense that they do not rely on the internal description of the underlying cryptographic algorithm. Moreover, our ASAs are also practical since they can affect not only the widely deployed cryptographic standards, but also the ongoing NIST post-quantum standards.}

	abstract = {The One-Tap Authentication (OTAuth) based on the cellular network is a password-less login service provided by Mobile Network Operator (MNO) through the unique communication gateway access technique. The service allows app users to quickly sign up or log in with their mobile phone numbers without entering a password. Due to its convenience, OTAuth has been widely used by various apps. However, some studies have elaborated that OTAuth services are of great drawbacks from the perspective of mobile security and identified several flawed designs, which make the MNO cannot distinguish malicious apps from normal ones and cause impersonation attacks. In this paper, we further analyze OTAuth services from the perspective of 4G and 5G cellular networks and focus on two important procedures in which the cellular network plays an important role in OTAuth services. Not surprisingly, we discover a new fundamental design flaw in determining whether the runtime environment supports OTAuth services. Moreover, we propose a mature attack paradigm by exploiting this flaw, which allows an attacker to login or register one app as a victim. To evaluate the impact of the attack, we have examined 100/90/100 Android/iOS/HarmonyOS apps for OTAuth services of 3 mainstream MNOs in China. The experimental results show that our proposed attack is applicable to almost all the apps that support OTAuth services, and affects more apps than the attacks that have been reported before. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to defend against the attack. Note that, for security’s sake, we have already reported our findings to authorized parties and received their confirmations.}

The proposed method is an output perturbation mechanism that adds noise to the release of query response such that the analyst is unable to infer the underlying class-label. The proposed DP method is capable of not only protecting the privacy of class-based data but also meets quality metrics of accuracy and is computationally efficient and practical. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method empirically while outperforming the baseline additive Gaussian noise mechanism. We also examine a real-world application and apply the proposed DP method to the autoregression and moving average (ARMA) forecasting method, protecting the privacy of the underlying data source. Case studies on the real-world advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) measurements of household power consumption validate the excellent performance of the proposed DP method while also satisfying the accuracy of forecasted power consumption measurements.}

	abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN) models have been widely used in many tasks due to their superior performance. However, DNN models are usually vulnerable to adversarial example attacks, which limits their applications in many safety-critic scenarios. How to effectively detect adversarial examples to enhance the robustness of DNN models has attracted much attention in recent years. Most adversarial example detection methods require modifying or retraining the model, which is impractical and reduces the classification accuracy of normal examples. In this paper, we propose an adversarial example detection approach that does not require modification of the DNN models and meanwhile retains the classification accuracy of normal examples. The key observation is that when we transform the input example with some operations (e.g., masking a pixel with a reference value), feed the transformed example to the target model, and use the output of the intermediate layers to predict the label of the example, the generated label sequences of adversarial examples will be extremely discrepant but the label sequences of normal examples keep nearly unchanged. Motivated by this observation, we design an approach to detect adversarial examples based on the label sequence discrepancy (LSD) of the given examples. The experimental results against five mainstream adversarial attacks on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSD outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in the detection rate of adversarial examples. Moreover, LSD performs well at various confidence levels and exhibits good generalizability between different attacks.}

	abstract = {The semi-supervised face recognition problem has become a popular research topic in recent years. However, one common and important situation, in which the unlabeled data is shallow, has rarely been considered in most existing works. In this paper, shallow data means there are only few images per identity. In the unlabeled shallow situation, the existing semi-supervised face recognition methods generally do not work well. Thus, how to effectively utilize the unlabeled shallow face data for improving face recognition performance is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised face recognition method, namely VirFace\n∞\n, to enhance the face recognition performance effectively with the unlabeled shallow data. VirFace\n∞\nconsists of VirClass and VirDistribution components. In VirClass, we inject the unlabeled data as virtual classes into the feature space to enlarge the inter-class distance. In VirDistribution, we predict the distribution of each virtual class, namely virtual distribution, and then enhance the inter-class discriminativeness by enlarging the distances between the labeled features and the virtual distributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to tackle the face recognition problem on unlabeled shallow face data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.}

	abstract = {Real-time eyeblink detection in the wild is a recently emerged challenging task that suffers from dramatic variations in face attribute, pose, illumination, camera view and distance, etc. One key issue is to well characterize eyelid’s intrinsic motion (i.e., approaching and departure between upper and lower eyelid) robustly, under unconstrained conditions. Towards this, a novel eyelid’s intrinsic motion-aware feature learning approach is proposed. Our proposition lies in 3 folds. First, the feature extractor is led to focus on informative eye region adaptively via introducing visual attention in a coarse-to-fine way, to guarantee robustness and fine-grained descriptive ability jointly. Then, 2 constraints are proposed to make feature learning be aware of eyelid’s intrinsic motion. Particularly, one concerns the fact that the inter-frame feature divergence within eyeblink processes should be greater than non-eyeblink ones to better reveal eyelid’s intrinsic motion. The other constraint minimizes the inter-frame feature divergence of non-eyeblink samples, to suppress motion clues due to head or camera movement, illumination change, etc. Meanwhile, concerning the high ambiguity between eyeblink and non-eyeblink samples, soft sample labels are acquired via self-knowledge distillation to conduct feature learning with finer supervision than the hard ones. The experiments verify that, our proposition is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art ones (i.e., advantage on F1-score over 7%) and with real-time running efficiency. It is also of strong generalization capacity towards constrained conditions. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenzhengzeng/blink_eyelid .}

The clients compute local models and send them to an aggregator which computes a global model. In hybrid FL, the local parameters are additionally masked using secure aggregation, such that only the global aggregated statistics become available in clear text, not the client specific updates. In this context, we investigate the data leakage of three popular algorithms for QR decomposition, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, the Householder algorithm and Givens rotation. We show that, even when using additive SMPC, Givens rotation and the Householder matrix leak raw data and are therefore not suited for this computation paradigm. Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization relies on inner vector products and does not leak raw data points.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing has been widely accepted as a computing paradigm to offer high-quality data services on demand. However, it suffers from various attacks as the cloud service provider and data owners are not in the same trusted domain. To support data confidentiality, existing cloud-based systems apply cryptographic tools to issue the decryption key to data users to share data in a controlled way. However, fine-grained cloud data sharing still faces many challenges, especially when dealing with dynamic user groups. In this paper, we introduce a secure and efficient cloud-based data-sharing system with fine-grained access control and dynamic user groups. Our system enjoys 1) adaptive security in prime-order groups, 2) forward secrecy against revoked user fetches data generated before being revoked, and 3) decryption key exposure resistance against the compromise of the frequently used decryption key, where the previous solutions only concentrate on one or two above-mentioned properties. More specifically, we introduce two timestamp management mechanisms that manage the timestamp in each ciphertext to support dynamic user groups with forward secrecy. By applying the proposed timestamp management mechanisms, we introduce two novel designs of attribute-based encryption schemes with formal definition and security analyses. The proposed schemes are adaptively secure in prime-order groups under a standard assumption and support decryption key exposure resistance. We conduct theoretical analysis and experimental simulation to demonstrate the outperformance of our solutions.}

	abstract = {Data management services provided by the public cloud can economize the enterprise’s local storage costs, and meanwhile, realize data sharing among the enterprise. Corporate users, however, usually have concerns about the security and privacy of their data stored in the public cloud. Searchable encryption has been used as a secure method for enterprise users in the public cloud to share data via keyword search for many years. Nevertheless, conventional search and encryption primitives are challenging to realize several critical functions flexibly, such as key update, user revocation, lightweight computation, and low communication overhead for users, which will impede their widespread application. Besides, it may cause single-key-exposure security concerns by using untrusted devices. To address these issues, we present a dynamic consensus committee-based for secure data sharing with authorized multi-receiver searchable encryption (called DCC-SE), which exploits the blockchain dynamic committee to eliminate a single-key-exposure problem and enables fast keyword search without pairing and dynamic user management. The proposed DCC-SE scheme enjoys minor computation and communication overheads. It maintains a constant ciphertext size as the receiver increases. Furthermore, it periodically supports secure key and ciphertext updating and has been proven secure against chosen plaintext attacks and the chosen keyword guessing attacks under the random oracle model. The performance evaluation results show that DCC-SE has more feasibility and higher efficiency than the previous public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) schemes through theoretical analysis and simulation studies.}

In this paper, we propose an optimization-based formal model to find the optimal false data injection attack (OFDIA) with the minimum required time leading to an FRO. The proposed model considers the dynamic behavior of the power system in an optimization framework to find the optimal size of attacks over multiple generators’ dispatching cycles to minimize the attack launch time. Using the proposed formal modeling, we study the impact of power system parameters, including inertia, governor’s droop and time constant, and the attacker’s accessibility to loads on the attack success and launch time. The results demonstrate that systems with low inertia are more vulnerable to FDIAs while systems with higher inertia are more secure as fewer generator protection relays are impacted by FRO. In addition, we show that securing more load meters can increase the time for launching an attack in the system. Moreover, our studies show that a combination of large values of the governor’s time constants and small values of the governor’s droops can raise the time of successful attacks, making the system more secure against FDIAs.}

	abstract = {Due to the limited battery and computing resource, offloading unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)’ computation tasks to ground infrastructure, e.g., vehicles, is a fundamental framework. Under such an open and untrusted environment, vehicles are reluctant to share their computing resource unless provisioning strong incentives, privacy protection, and fairness guarantee. Precisely, without strategy-proofness guarantee, the strategic vehicles can overclaim participation costs so as to conduct market manipulation. Without the fairness provision, vehicles can deliberately abort the assigned tasks without any punishments, and UAVs can refuse to pay by the end, causing an exchange dilemma. Lastly, the strategy-proofness and fairness provision typically require transparent payment/task results exchange under public audit, which may disclose sensitive information of vehicles and make the privacy preservation a foremost issue. To achieve the three design goals, we propose SEAL, an integrated framework to address S trategy-proof, fair, and privacy-pr E serving U A V computation off L oading. SEAL deploys a strategy-proof reverse combinatorial auction mechanism to optimize UAVs’ task offloading under practical constraints while ensuring economic-robustness and polynomial-time efficiency. Based on smart contracts and hashchain micropayment, SEAL implements a fair on-chain exchange protocol to realize the atomic completion of batch payments and computing results in multi-round auctions. In addition, a privacy-preserving off-chain auction protocol is devised with the assistance of the trusted processor to efficiently protect vehicles’ bid privacy. Using rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we validate that SEAL can effectively prevent vehicles from manipulating, ensure privacy protection and fairness, improve the offloading efficiency, and reduce UAV’s energy costs and expenses with low overheads.}

In this paper, we challenge the robustness of existing deep hiding schemes by preventing the recovery of secret images, building on our in-depth study of state-of-the-art deep hiding schemes and their vulnerabilities. Leveraging our analysis, we first propose a simple box-free removal attack on deep hiding that does not require any prior knowledge of the deep hiding schemes. To improve the removal performance on the deep hiding schemes that may be enhanced by adversarial training, we further design a more powerful removal attack, efficient box-free removal attack (EBRA), which employs image inpainting techniques to remove secret images from container images. In addition, to ensure the effectiveness of our attack and preserve the fidelity of the processed container images, we design an erasing phase based on the locality of deep hiding to remove secret information and then make full use of the visual information of container images to repair the erased visual content. Extensive evaluations show our method can completely remove secret images from container images with negligible impact on the quality of container images.}

	abstract = {With the spread of tampered images, locating the tampered regions in digital images has drawn increasing attention. The existing tampering localization methods, however, suffer from severe performance degradation when the images are subjected to some post-processing, as the tampering traces would be distorted by the post-processing operations. The poor robustness against post-processing has become a bottleneck for the practical applications of image tampering localization techniques. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel re storation-assisted framework for image tampering loc alization (ReLoc). The ReLoc framework mainly consists of an image restoration module and a tampering localization module. The key idea of ReLoc is to use the restoration module to recover a high-quality counterpart from the distorted tampered image, such that the distorted tampering traces can be re-enhanced, facilitating the tampering localization module to identify the tampered regions. To achieve this, the restoration module is optimized not only with the conventional constraints on image visual quality, but also with a forensics-oriented objective function. Furthermore, the restoration module and the localization module are trained alternately, which can stabilize the training process and is beneficial for improving the performance. The robustness of ReLoc has been evaluated by using several common post-processing operations, including lossy compressions, online social network transmission, and image resizing. Extensive experimental results show that ReLoc can significantly improve the localization performance compared to using a restoration-free model. In addition, we have shown that the restoration module in a well-trained ReLoc model is transferable for different localization modules and across different datasets.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration has led to more flexible and reliable vehicle-to-grid-enabled cyber-physical systems (V2G-CPSs). However, the increasing system complexity also makes them more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT) technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL) in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS, considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.}

	abstract = {Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an influential derivative that allows humans to uncover invisible knowledge, potentially substituting it for extensive labeling data. Despite the optimism generated by the availability of unlabeled data, its potential unreliability can result in numerous unknown security risks. Assailants may covertly contaminate data, leading to potentially catastrophic and unpredictable outcomes. We investigate poisoning attacks in triangular manifolds to understand how SSL models defend against attacks resulting from small perturbations. By inserting tiny amounts of artificially modified samples totaling 2% of the entire training set, we can deceive classification models into altering the prediction results of arbitrary categories. In addition, considering that the poisoned data in practical scenarios belong to a minority sample attack, which is typically only about 0.1%-2% of the total data, we employed outlier detection to examine all inserted instances and discovered that it could bypass discovery. Our poisoning strategy can work across multiple datasets, models, and application domains of images and network traffic. Experimental results prove that our proposed method is effective on at least seven semi-supervised models. The declining ratio of model detection accuracy of autoencoder with confidence (ConAE) is 52.55% at the lowest cost. Another persuasive result is that our model poisoning exceeds the state-of-the-art methods in the image domain. The extended conclusion corroborates that the more accurate classification models do not have a corresponding improvement in their ability to resist interference, which also provides a new standard for testing model robustness.}

	abstract = {Secure cloud-assisted data publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub) service provides an asynchronous method for publishers and subscribers to non-interactively exchange encrypted messages. Besides performing conjunctive subscription policy, numerous data Pub/Sub systems have recently been proposed to provide dynamic access control enforced from the publisher side to the subscriber side. However, these solutions fail to consider the following properties: (i) bilateral access control for both publishers and subscribers; (ii) the anonymity of the publisher; (iii) high matching time cost between publication and subscription. Therefore, we present P/S-BiAC, a secure and boolean cloud-assisted data Pub/Sub system with attribute-based bilateral access control that achieves authenticity and anonymity of publishers. In particular, P/S-BiAC enables cloud-based brokers to use the subscriber’s trapdoor to match published data with sub-linear time complexity. Technically, we introduce a “BiAC-and-Hidden” technique to refine publication tuples and trapdoor in classic searchable symmetric encryption solutions. Moreover, we implement P/S-BiAC and evaluate its practical performance based on Enron dataset in real cloud environment. To deal with a conjunctive subscription policy, P/S-BiAC runs\n27.8×\nfaster for matching time cost (with\ns\n-term=10) compared to state-of-the-art solutions, which demonstrates its feasibility in practical data Pub/Sub services with strong security properties.}

In the previous studies, the fundamental limits of such a protocol were analyzed, and the results showed that two auxiliary random variables were involved in the capacity region expressions. However, with two auxiliary random variables, it is difficult to directly apply the expressions to derive the computable forms of the capacity regions for certain information sources such as binary and Gaussian sources, which hold importance in practical applications. In this paper, we explore the structure of authentication channels and reveal that for the classes of degraded and less noisy authentication channels, a single auxiliary random variable is sufficient to express the capacity regions. As specific examples, we use the expressions with one auxiliary random variable to derive the computable forms for binary and Gaussian sources. Numerical calculations for the Gaussian case show the trade-off between secret-key and privacy-leakage rates under a given storage rate, which illustrates how the noise in the enrollment phase affects the capacity region.}

IP arguments are crucial building blocks for range proof and zero knowledge arguments, which can be applied to verifiable computation, confidential transactions, decentralized identification, and so on. This paper proposes a novel efficient IP argument with a trustless setup. For integer vectors of size\nN\n, the proposed IP argument provides a proof size of\nO(\nlog\n2\nN)\n, a verification cost of\nO(\nN\n−\n−\n√\n)\n, and a size of public parameter size of\nO(\nN\n−\n−\n√\n)\n. The construction relies solely on the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption, a well-established standard cryptographic assumption. Consequently, we obtain the first DL-based IP argument with a trustless setup that achieves a sublinear verifier and logarithmic proof size, which we call Leopard. Furthermore, We empirically evaluate the performance of Leopard. The experimental results demonstrate that Leopard is highly efficient and scalable compared to previous works.}

	abstract = {Despite the myriad benefits offered by blockchain technology, most of them still face several interrelated issues, such as limited transaction throughput, exorbitant transaction fees, and protracted confirmation times. Payment channel networks have emerged as a promising scalability solution, allowing two mutually distrustful users to engage in multiple off-chain transactions. However, existing schemes based on Hash Time Lock Contract or Anonymous Multi-hop Lock generally cannot ensure strong unlinkability of payments, due to the fact that the time-lock information still remains on the blockchain. To enhance on-chain privacy, a versatile tool was recently proposed by Thyagarajan et al. (CCS’20), named Verifiable Timed Signatures, but it suffers from the dual insufficiencies of linear-increasing performance and time unverifiability (i.e., performance is linear to the number of signature shares, and signatures cannot be ensured recoverable after the specified time). In this paper, we first propose an approach to reduce computational overhead of VTS, which can be applied to enhance other established schemes, such as VTD (S&P’22) and VTLRS (ESORICS’22). To further reduce the computational complexity from\nO(n)\nto\nO(1)\n, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called Verifiable Timed Adaptor Signatures. Moreover, we extend the VTAS to VTAS+ which provides the security property of verifiable recovery. We demonstrate the practicality of our proposal via presenting a concrete instantiation and constructing a privacy-enhanced payment channel network. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation reveals that our solutions exhibit superior performance than the state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN) based website fingerprinting (WF) attacks pose a severe threat to the privacy of Tor users. To overcome this challenge, adversarial perturbation based WF defenses have been recently proposed to fool the classifiers of attackers, through purposefully perturbing the user’s traffic traces. Unfortunately, these defenses significantly deteriorate once the WF attacks are enhanced with adversarial training (AT). AT endows the WF attacks with more powerful website recognition capability, through learning the perturbed traffic traces generated by attackers. To resist the WF attacks enhanced by AT, we develop a black-box WF defense, called Acup3. First, Acup3 leverages many-to- one website imitation to make the traffic traces associated with different websites look more like each other, increasing the difficulty of website classification. Second, Acup3 generates trace-agnostic perturbations without accessing traffic traces, making it suitable for practical deployment. Third, Acup3 employs perturbation variation to diversify the traffic traces of different users visiting the same website, making the knowledge learnt from AT less helpful for WF attacks. Therefore, Acup3 is more robust against AT. Experiments demonstrate Acup3 markedly surpasses four representative WF defenses (e.g., Mockingbird and AWA) in defense capability and bandwidth overhead. Facing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack Var-CNN enhanced with AT, Acup3 depresses its attack success rate (ASR) from 98% to 24.29% with only 13.95% bandwidth overhead. Compared to the SOTA defense AWA, Acup3 causes a 24.5% larger decrement in ASR of WF attacks, and achieves a more than 100 times faster speed of perturbation generation.}

	abstract = {Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE), a special cryptographic primitive, can efficiently perform ciphertext conversion on the cloud. To enable the data owner (i.e. delegator) to authorize a file access path according to the different priorities of the users (i.e. delegatees), autonomous path proxy re-encryption (AP-PRE) was proposed, where the delegator can generate a proxy re-encryption autonomous path in order of the delegatees’ priority. If one delegatee does not hold the decryption right, the ciphertext can be converted to a new ciphertext that can be decrypted by the next delegatee with lower priority in the path. Although AP-PRE enables the delegator to pre-define the whole decryption path, the access policy only supports a linked path and the data owner disallows the nodes in the proxy path to generate delegating branches to access its data. Such a linked path may be too long in practice, especially when the system scales up (i.e. the average complexity of encrypted data access is O(n) where ${n}$ denotes the number of delegatees). Hence, we propose a generalized autonomous path proxy re-encryption (APB-PRE) scheme for supporting branch functionality. Firstly, by setting the token and a carefully designed ciphertext structure, the branch functionality of the path delegation is realized. Specifically, we utilize the bilinearity of bilinear pairing to construct the token for the transition of the label embedded in the ciphertext in different paths, resulting in a far more flexible access structure with a tree-like topology. In APB-PRE, the delegatees with lower priority who need to share data can complete the decryption task earlier, without affecting the decryption of the high-priority delegatees. Finally, we prove that it achieves IND-HRA security under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Benefiting from the creation of branching paths, users on the branching path can get the re-encrypted ciphertext much earlier. Therefore, the average complexity of encrypted data access reduces to O(log n) compared to AP-PRE. The experimental results show that our proposal can extend the branching functionalities of AP-PRE with only moderate computational cost.}

	abstract = {Wireless energy harvesting (WEH) enabled Device-to-Device (D2D) communication emerges as an effective technique to improve spectral and energy efficiencies. However, D2D users are usually power-constrained devices that may be monitored or attacked by adversaries easily. To confuse randomly distributed adversaries in WEH-enabled D2D underlaying cellular networks, power beacons (PBs) can be used to send jamming signals in idle time slots. A time slot is divided into two sub-slots, i.e., WEH sub-slot and covert transmission sub-slot. The energy collected by a D2D transmitter in the first sub-slot is used to support possible covert transmission in the second sub-slot. The performance of the proposed scheme is measured by covert throughput, which is defined as D2D communication rate with several constraints, e.g., wireless energy harvesting, covertness, and cellular link communication requirements. The closed-form expressions of energy outage probability, covert probability, and desired link connection outage probabilities are derived. The minimum covert probability is used to measure covertness. Moreover, an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to maximize covert throughput. The analytical results are compared with Monte-Carlo simulation results to verify the analytical approach. In addition, the impacts of different parameters (e.g., density of PBs and covert signal transmit power) on covert performance are evaluated.}

	abstract = {Unconstrained Palmprint Recognition (UPR) shows engaging potential owing to its high hygiene and privacy. The unconstrained acquisition usually produces wide variations, against which deep methods resort to large samples that are unavailable in practice, however. We focus on Few-Shot UPR (FS-UPR), a more general problem, recognizing query samples given a few support samples per class. Because scarce samples insufficiently represent potential variations, the augmentation methods train independent hallucinators on large samples to generate more ones. Whereas, the hallucinators trained independently of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) are blind of generating promising samples to boost the downstream FSL. Moreover, training hallucinators requires large samples per class, unavailable from unconstrained palmprint databases. We aim to address FS-UPR via contrastive augmentation merely on the support samples. Observing the variations to be transferable across samples, we exploit low-rank representation to disentangle support samples into principles and variations in embedding space and augment features by variation transfer. To this end, we devise an end-to-end Deep Low-Rank Representation Feature Augmentation Network (DLRR-FAN) to simultaneously learn the embedding space and augmentation features with guaranteed reality and diversity. Furthermore, a Contrastive Recognition Regularizer (CRR) is tailored to secure the discriminability of augmentation features. During each training episode, the task motivates DLRR-FAN to augment such features that correct the biased prototypes towards upcoming query samples with variations unseen in the support samples, namely task-driven prototype correction. Extensive experiments on both the typical and extended FS-UPR tasks demonstrate the efficacy of DLRR-FAN versus the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The primary objective of anti-jamming techniques is to ensure that the transmitted data arrives at the intended receiver without being disturbed or jammed with by any jamming signal or other hostile activities to ensuring the security of the communication system. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been extensively utilized in solving the dynamic spectrum anti-jamming problem. However, most of existing DRL-based algorithms require lots of training time, which fails to adapt the fast-channging jamming environment. Our objective is to find a practical and fast-convergence anti-jamming learning solution. To achieve this, we redesign the DRL algorithm in the following two ways. First, we split the cycle of reinforcement learning into two parts: applying process and training process. Second, we use soft labels instead of rewards which bring more information. We further theoretically show that the information gain can help our proposed algorithm converge faster. Moreover, we also show that our labeled DRL algorithm is better than the idealized DRL-based scheme which can obtain the same information as the soft labels. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with existing DRL-based algorithms, our proposed algorithm reduces the number of iterations by up to 90%.}

	abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) systems typically struggle to address the challenge of data aggregation, incentive design, and privacy protection, simultaneously. However, existing solutions usually focus on one or, at most, two of these issues. To this end, this paper presents CROWD FA, a novel paradigm for privacy-preserving MCS through federated analytics (FA), which aims to achieve a well-rounded solution encompassing data aggregation, incentive design, and privacy protection. Specifically, inspired by FA, CROWD FA initiates an MCS computing paradigm that enables data aggregation and incentive design. Participants can perform aggregation operations on their local data, facilitated by CROWD FA, which supports various common data aggregation operations and bidding incentives. To address privacy concerns, CROWD FA relies solely on an efficient cryptographic primitive known as additive secret sharing to simultaneously achieve privacy-preserving data aggregation and privacy-preserving incentive. To instantiate CROWD FA, this paper presents a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (PRADA) based on CROWD FA, capable of supporting a range of data aggregation operations. Additionally, a CROWD FA-based privacy-preserving incentive mechanism (PRAED) is designed to ensure truthful and fair incentives for each participant, while maximizing their individual rewards. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that CROWD FA protects participants’ data and bid privacy while effectively aggregating sensing data. Notably, CROWD FA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving up to 22 times faster computation time.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in the fingerprinting of deep neural networks are able to detect specific instances of models, placed in a black-box interaction scheme. Inputs used by the fingerprinting protocols are specifically crafted for each precise model to be checked for. While efficient in such a scenario, this nevertheless results in a lack of guarantee after a mere modification of a model (e.g. finetuning, quantization of the parameters). This article generalizes fingerprinting to the notion of model families and their variants and extends the task-encompassing scenarios where one wants to fingerprint not only a precise model (previously referred to as a detection task) but also to identify which model or family is in the black-box (identification task). The main contribution is the proposal of fingerprinting schemes that are resilient to significant modifications of the models. We achieve these goals by demonstrating that benign inputs, that are unmodified images, are sufficient material for both tasks. We leverage an information-theoretic scheme for the identification task. We devise a greedy discrimination algorithm for the detection task. Both approaches are experimentally validated over an unprecedented set of more than 1,000 networks.}

Due to the size of the forums and the domain expertise required to identify criminal discussions, most approaches employ supervised machine learning techniques to automatically classify the posts of interest. Human annotation is costly. How to select samples to annotate that account for the structure of the forum? We present a methodology to generate stratified samples based on information about the centrality properties of the population and evaluate classifier performance. We observe that by employing a sample obtained from a uniform distribution of the post degree centrality metric, we maintain the same level of precision but significantly increase the recall (+30%) compared to a sample whose distribution is respecting the population stratification. We find that classifiers trained with similar samples disagree on the classification of criminal activities up to 33% of the time when deployed on the entire forum.}

	abstract = {Otoacoustic emission (OAE) biometrics are inherently robust to replay and falsification attacks. The widely studied transient-evoked OAE (TEOAE) is non-stationary and offers biometric value only in normal-hearing individuals since it is more susceptible to hearing loss. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel yet promising OAE biometric modality-stimulus-frequency OAE (SFOAE). Unlike TEOAE, SFOAE is a highly stationary signal whose fine structures are idiosyncratic to an individual, and relatively stable over time, making it easier to be a biometric without additional complex feature extraction. Moreover, SFOAE is even present in ears with 50 dB HL hearing loss, applicable to hearing-impaired users. In this paper, SFOAE spectra in response to three stimulus levels are fused in the feature level to consolidate different information, followed by a linear discriminant analysis or a multi-kernel convolutional neural network to further reduce the intra-subject variability and increase the inter-subject variability. Tested on a large cohort of subjects containing varying levels of deafness, the SFOAE-based biometric system yields an equal error rate of 0.541% and 1.364% in closed-set and open-set verification scenarios, respectively. In an identification mode, 99.43% and 97.37% accuracies are attained for closed-set and open-set protocols, respectively. In particular, we observe perfect performance in a population restricted to normal hearing in closed-set scenarios. The reason why the system performs well has been examined based on several comparative tests. Although there are implementation issues to be resolved before SFOAE can be applied in the field of biometric, this paper preliminarily demonstrates the basis and excellent potential of SFOAE as a biometric.}

	abstract = {Most person re-identification (re-ID) approaches are based on representation learning of pedestrian images, which assume that the person’s appearance captured by cameras in the target is fully available. However, the exposure of appearance could cause serious privacy leakages. To address this issue, we focus on a new privacy-protected person re-ID task where the person’s appearance is unavailable for training. We first overcome the dilemma of lacking real person images by utilizing the virtual pedestrian samples (e.g., PersonX). Then, we introduce a composition of data augmentations to simulate real conditions, where the learned model is transferred to the real target in a black way. Specifically, the background behind, surrounding illumination, pose, scale, and attributes of pedestrians from the target scene, irrelevant to privacy, are utilized to generate virtual images. With above privacy-irrelevant information, we propose a Translation-Rendering-Sampling (TRS) framework to generate images toward the distribution of the real-world dataset (including background, pose, attribute, etc). Extensive experiments are conducted on several realistic re-ID datasets excluding the person’s appearance. The experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline significantly as well as some transfer learning methods.}

	abstract = {Local differential privacy (LDP) is a promising technique to realize privacy-preserving data aggregation without a trusted aggregator. Normally, an LDP protocol requires each user to locally perturb his raw data and submit the perturbed data to the aggregator. Consequently, LDP is vulnerable to output poisoning attacks. Malicious users can skip the perturbation and submit carefully crafted data to the aggregator, altering the data aggregation results. Existing verifiable LDP protocols, which can verify the perturbation process and prevent output poisoning attacks, usually incur significant computation and communication costs, due to the use of zero-knowledge proofs. In this paper, we analyze the attacks on two classic LDP protocols for frequency estimation, namely GRR and OUE, and propose two verifiable LDP protocols. The proposed protocols are based on an interactive framework, where the user and the aggregator complete the perturbation together. By providing some additional information, which reveals nothing about the raw data but helps the verification, the user can convince the aggregator that he is incapable of launching an output poisoning attack. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocols have good defensive performance and outperform existing approaches in terms of efficiency.}

As a complementary type of adversary, patch attacks that introduce perceptible perturbations to the images have attracted the interest of researchers. Existing patch attacks rely on the architecture of the model or the probabilities of predictions and perform poorly in the decision-based setting, which can still construct a perturbation with the minimal information exposed – the top-1 predicted label. In this work, we first explore the decision-based patch attack. To enhance the attack efficiency, we model the patches using paired key-points and use targeted images as the initialization of patches, and parameter optimizations are all performed on the integer domain. Then, we propose a differential evolutionary algorithm named DevoPatch for query-efficient decision-based patch attacks. Experiments demonstrate that DevoPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box patch attacks in terms of patch area and attack success rate within a given query budget on image classification and face verification. Additionally, we conduct the vulnerability evaluation of ViT and MLP on image classification in the decision-based patch attack setting for the first time. Using DevoPatch, we can evaluate the robustness of models to black-box patch attacks. We believe this method could inspire the design and deployment of robust vision models based on various DNN architectures in the future.}

However, the method has yet to be considered a crucial need for replication on searchable encrypted data. It calls for challenging works on Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) since clients must share the search capability of the encrypted data replicas and guarantee forward and backward privacy. We define a new notion called “Keyword Search Shareable Encryption” (KS2E2E) and the corresponding security model capturing forward and backward privacy. In our notion, data owners are allowed to share search indexes of the encrypted data with users. A search index will be updated with a new search key before sharing to guarantee the data privacy of the source database. The target database also inherits data search efficiency along with the shared data. We further construct an instance of KS2E called Branch, prove its security, and use real-world datasets to evaluate Branch. The evaluation results show that Branch’s performance is comparable to classical DSSE schemes on search efficiency and demonstrate the effectiveness of searching encrypted data replicas from multiple owners.}

This primitive protects the privacy of clients and does not reveal exactly the matching messages to the untrusted cloud. However, the existing public-key-based schemes require many public keys to generate a single flag ciphertext. This introduces heavy costs in terms of public-key certificate management. In this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based fuzzy message detection method based on a novel identity-based online/offline encryption scheme. All heavy cost computation operations are carried out in the offline phase without the knowledge of the identities for each message, and the single flag ciphertext can be generated quickly with the message’s identities since only light cost computations are required in the online phase. We apply our scheme to the blockchain-based fuzzy message detection systems. Additionally, we design a new history indexing scheme based on Dodis’ verifiable random function and Schnorr’s signature. The transactions history and order of accessing storage cloud (storing and detecting messages) are indexed, and signed by each client. We provide the analysis of privacy guarantees and differential privacy requirements for our online/offline ID-FMD scheme, and implement our FMD system over the Fibos platform and the Huawei Elastic Cloud.}

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.}

	abstract = {Trace alignment can improve the subsequent side-channel analysis against the trace. Most current trace alignment schemes are, however, typically operated under a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which demands them to be noise reduced before alignment when practical applications in the complex environment. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for applying adaptive filtering in trace alignment preprocessing under low SNR conditions. The approach selects a trace as the reference signal of the adaptive filter, and the impulse response describing the trace offset is calculated iteratively for each trace. Different from conventional trace alignment methods, the error between the two traces in iteration determines how to eliminate the offset between trace, which eliminate most of the noise effects in the iteration process. In parallel, the filter after iterating will also function as a low-pass filter in the alignment process. Experimental studies based on three side-channel datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Compared with other alignment methods, with the reasonable computational resource cost and complexity, the average number of traces required has reduced the average number of traces required by 75%, the average confidence has improved by 60%, and the success rate has increased by 72%. Our approach provides great potential for applications in trace alignment preprocessing of side-channel analysis.}

	abstract = {Ateniese et al. introduced the primitive of matchmaking encryption (ME) at CRYPTO 2019 and left open several important questions, which include extending ME to fuzzy cases or giving an efficient ME in the identity-based setting without relying on random oracles. The main challenge is to achieve fuzzy bilateral access control while providing identity privacy of the sender and receiver, message confidentiality and authenticity without random oracles. In this work, we resolve the question by formalizing the first fuzzy identity-based ME (IB-ME) and presenting a concrete construction. Specifically, we propose the formal syntax definition of fuzzy IB-ME. In fuzzy IB-ME, the identities of senders and receivers are characterized by attribute sets. A ciphertext can be correctly decrypted if the overlaps between the attribute set of the sender or receiver and the attribute set specified by the other party are simultaneously greater than a threshold, which can be applied to many attractive applications such as fuzzy bilateral access control in online social dating. Then, we present concrete details of fuzzy IB-ME based on fuzzy identity-based encryption, which does not rely on other cryptographic tools such as two-input functional encryption and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems. In this process, fuzzy bilateral access control and identity privacy are achieved through the formalism of arranged ME and the splitting technique while message authenticity is provided through the authentication and binding of the encryption key. The identity privacy of the sender and receiver, confidentiality, and authenticity of messages are reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman, decision linear, and computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumptions in the selective model without random oracles. Finally, we implement the scheme and evaluate its performance through theoretical analyses and experiments to demonstrate its efficiency.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have been widely used in various domains owing to the success of deep learning. However, recent studies have shown that these models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we focus on the issue of adversarial robustness by examining it through the lens of semantic information, which drives us to propose a new perspective, i.e., adversarial attacks destroy the correlation between visual representations and semantic word vectors, while adversarial training restores it. Additionally, we discover that the correlation among robust representations of different categories aligns with the correlation among the corresponding semantic word vectors. Based on these empirical observations, we incorporate the semantic information into the model training process and propose Semantic Constraint Adversarial Robust Learning (SCARL). Firstly, inspired by the information-theoretical perspective, we maximize mutual information to bridge the information gap between the visual representations and the corresponding semantic word vectors in the embedding space. We further provide a differentiable lower bound to optimize such mutual information efficiently. Secondly, we introduce a novel semantic structure constraint that maintains the structure of visual representations consistent with that of semantic word vectors. Finally, we integrate these techniques with adversarial training to learn robust visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets (such as CIFAR and TinyImageNet) and evaluate the robustness against various adversarial attacks (such as PGD-attack and AutoAttack), demonstrating the benefits of incorporating semantic information for improving model robustness.}

	abstract = {Multi-label pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) involves assigning multiple attributes to pedestrian images captured by video surveillance cameras. Despite its importance, learning robust attribute-related features for PAR remains a challenge due to the large intra-attribute variations in the image space. These variations, which stem from changes in pedestrian poses, illumination conditions, and background noise, make extracted attribute-related features susceptible to irrelevant information or noise interference. Existing PAR methods rely on body prior extractors or attention mechanisms to locate attribute-correlation regions for extracting robust features. However, these methods may not be robust to intra-attribute variations, which limits their effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and flexible PAR framework that leverages the exponential information bottleneck (ExpIB) approach. Our ExpIB-Net uses mutual information compression as the main penalty during the early stage of training, thereby eliminating irrelevant information. As training progresses, the mutual information penalty weakens and the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss) contributes to improving the PAR recognition accuracy. Our method can also be integrated into an attention module to form the AttExpIB-Net, which better handles intra-attribute variations for better performance. Additionally, our model-agnostic ExpIB approach is plug-and-play, requiring no additional computational overhead during inference. Experiments on several challenging PAR datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which raises security concerns for face recognition systems using DNNs. Previous attack methods focus on the perturbation texture and generate adversarial patches with fixed shapes at random or pre-designed locations, which causes poor adversarial transferability. This paper proposes a Spatial Mutable Adversarial Patch (SMAP) method to generate a dynamic mutable patch to be injected into the face. In the proposed SMAP, the texture, position and shape of the patch are optimized simultaneously and the patch generation pipeline is end-to-end differentiable. Specifically, a Patch Location Selection Scheme is designed to find the critical patch position with the most significant influence on the target identity by the step-based gradient search. By innovatively bridging the pre-defined mask and the dynamic update of the patch, the patch position and shape are changed based on the affine transformation and sampling mechanism in each iteration, which maintains the importance of the injected patch to the adversarial objective. To evaluate the vulnerability of face recognition models, we explore more threatening impersonation attacks under the black-box setting and design a strict evaluation metric that aligns with the real-world scenario. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SMAP improves attack performance across various face recognition models and datasets. Moreover, SMAP achieves better transferability on commercial face recognition systems than existing methods.}

	abstract = {In face antispoofing, it is desirable to have multimodal images to demonstrate liveness cues from various perspectives. However, in most face recognition scenarios, only a single modality, namely visible lighting (VIS) facial images is available. This paper first investigates the possibility of generating polarized (Polar) images from VIS cameras without changing the existing recognition devices to improve the accuracy and robustness of Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) in face biometrics. A novel multimodal face antispoofing framework is proposed based on the machine-learning relationship between VIS and Polar images of genuine faces. Specifically, a dual-modal central differential convolutional network (CDCN) is developed to capture the inherent spoofing features between the VIS and the generated Polar modalities. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our proposed framework not only generates realistic Polar face images but also improves the state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing results on the VIS modal database (i.e. CASIA-SURF). Moreover, a polar face database, CASIA-Polar, has been constructed and will be shared with the public at https://biometrics.idealtest.org to inspire future applications within the biometric anti-spoofing field.}

	abstract = {A Blockchain network consists of a distributed ledger and a set of nodes participating in the network. The consistency in the ledger’s state is maintained by a Blockchain consensus mechanism. This property is essential since it is assumed that the participants in the network do not trust each other. Most Blockchain consensus algorithms are unsuitable for resource-constrained nodes due to their power consumption, storage, network overhead, and computation requirements. Furthermore, many consensus methods do not address the issue of data accountability, which guarantees that an entity will be judged on its performance or conduct concerning a duty they have taken. This study proposes a novel consensus mechanism termed Proof of Block Height (PoBH) that prioritizes accountability for reporting IoT data transactions and considers factors such as low computation cost and energy consumption. The approach relies on a pre-existing comparable deterministic value based on the height of the committed blocks. The model identifies a malicious intent using a set of predicates and consequently incurs a computation penalty to keep such nodes away from the network. As a preventive measure, the model also seeks to increment this penalty appropriately by making the network free from dishonest nodes for as long as possible, thus sanitizing the network. Importantly, the developed method does not augment the basic hierarchy of an IoT network. A formal analysis of the mechanism’s operation shows that the resource and time required to cheat the system grows exponentially with the number of faulty blocks a node tries to append to the shared ledger. The factors affecting the mechanism’s performance, scalability, and effort required (by malicious nodes) to stay within the network are also quantitatively evaluated.}

	abstract = {Facial age estimation aims to rank the face aging data by taking in the correlation among age categories. Conventional age estimation models are trained based on assumed high-quality training annotations in a totally-supervised manner. However, noisy data in a sparse distribution collected from unconstrained environment usually account for the corruption of produced gradients and ordinal relationships, which may fail to fairly describe the correlated face aging data. In this paper, we propose a meta-set learning (MSL) approach for exploiting the unfairness of face aging datasets, thus achieving unbiased age classification in unconstrained conditions. To address this, we elaborately create an unfairness filtration network under the meta-learning paradigm, which exceeds a reliable margin-reweighting initialization suffering from class variance, simultaneously exploiting the meta-reweighting intervention to minimize the training bias caused by class imbalance. Moreover, our proposed model leverages the learned instance-level margin between logits and develops a unimodal constrained logits loss, further surviving age regression models from unfairness. Experimental results on multiple in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in fingerprint recognition continues to be establishing the identity of a suspect associated with partial and smudgy fingerprints left at a crime scene (i.e., latent prints or fingermarks). Despite the success of fixed-length embeddings for rolled and slap fingerprint recognition, the features learned for latent fingerprint matching have mostly been limited to local minutiae-based embeddings and have not directly leveraged global representations for matching. In this paper, we combine global embeddings with local embeddings for state-of-the-art latent to rolled matching accuracy with high throughput. The combination of both local and global representations leads to improved recognition accuracy across NIST SD 27, NIST SD 302, MSP, MOLF DB1/DB4, and MOLF DB2/DB4 latent fingerprint datasets for both closed-set (84.11%, 54.36%, 84.35%, 70.43%, 62.86% rank-1 retrieval rate, respectively) and open-set (0.50, 0.74, 0.44, 0.60, 0.68 FNIR at FPIR=0.02, respectively) identification scenarios on a gallery of 100K rolled fingerprints. Not only do we fuse the complimentary representations, we also use the local features to guide the global representations to focus on discriminatory regions in two fingerprint images to be compared. This leads to a multi-stage matching paradigm in which subsets of the retrieved candidate lists for each probe image are passed to subsequent stages for further processing, resulting in a considerable reduction in latency (requiring just 0.068 ms per latent to rolled comparison on an AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processor, roughly 15K comparisons per second). Finally, we show the generalizability of the fused representations for improving authentication accuracy across several rolled, plain, and contactless fingerprint datasets.}

Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-stage data representation scheme, called AI2Vec (Applicant Information Vectoring), as an information density booster. It can gradually boost information density of associations by simultaneously decreasing the scale of information carriers and increasing the amount of useful information. The qualified performance of our AI2Vec is validated by the experiments over real-life data from a prestigious online lending platform.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission of multi-resource heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs) in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) from the perspective of physical layer security. Considering the network heterogeneity, resource constrain, and channel similarity, it is challenging to implement the physical layer security in SAGIN. Particularly, digital twin (DT) is considered in the cyberspace of SAGIN to reflect the physical network entities (i.e., satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial base station), which is assumed to comprehensively control and manage the heterogeneous RANs’ resources. To ensure secure transmissions of multi-tier heterogeneous downlink communications in SAGIN, a multi-point symbiotic security scheme is proposed through DT-assisted multi-dimensional domain synergy precoding, where the co-channel interference due to spectrum sharing among these heterogeneous RANs is recast to unevenly corrupt the main and wiretap channels of each legitimate user. Specifically, to realize the multi-point symbiotic security, a max-min problem is formulated to maximize the minimum secrecy rate of three heterogeneous downlinks. Since this problem is non-convex and challenging, a list of mathematical reformulations is derived and the successive convex approximation (SCA) based multi-dimensional domain synergy precoding algorithm is proposed to solve it. Moreover, the computational complexity of our proposed approach is analyzed and meaningful discussions are made. In addition, extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the secrecy rate performance and verify the efficiency of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of Internet traffic, large sensitive and valuable information is at risk of cyber attacks, which are mostly preceded by network reconnaissance. A moving target defense technique called host address mutation (HAM) helps facing network reconnaissance. However, there still exist several fundamental problems in HAM: 1) current approaches cannot be self-adaptive to adversarial strategies; 2) network state is time-varying because each host decides whether to mutate IP address; and 3) most methods mainly focus on enhancing security, but ignore the survivability of existing connections. In this paper, an Intelligence-Driven Host Address Mutation (ID-HAM) scheme is proposed to address aforementioned challenges. We firstly model a Markov decision process (MDP) to describe the mutation process, and design a seamless mutation mechanism. Secondly, to remove infeasible actions from the action space of MDP, we formulate address-to-host assignments as a constrained satisfaction problem. Thirdly, we design an advantage actor-critic algorithm for HAM, which aims to learn from scanning behaviors. Finally, security analysis and extensive simulations highlight the effectiveness of ID-HAM. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, ID-HAM can decrease maximum 25% times of scanning hits while only influencing communication slightly. We also implemented a proof-of-concept prototype system to conduct experiments with multiple scanning tools.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm of privacy-preserving distributed machine learning that effectively deals with the privacy leakage problem by utilizing cryptographic primitives. However, how to prevent poisoning attacks in distributed situations has recently become a major FL concern. Indeed, an adversary can manipulate multiple edge nodes and submit malicious gradients to disturb the global model’s availability. Currently, most existing works rely on an Independently Identical Distribution (IID) situation and identify malicious gradients using plaintext. However, we demonstrates that current works cannot handle the data heterogeneity scenario challenges and that publishing unencrypted gradients imposes significant privacy leakage problems. Therefore, we develop APFed, a layered privacy-preserving defense mechanism that significantly mitigates the effects of poisoning attacks in data heterogeneity scenarios. Specifically, we exploit HE as the underlying technique and employ the median coordinate as the benchmark. Subsequently, we propose a secure cosine similarity scheme to identify poisonous gradients, and we innovatively use clustering as part of the defense mechanism and develop a hierarchical aggregation that enhances our scheme’s robustness in IID and non-IID scenarios. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that APFed outperforms existing defense strategies while reducing the communication overhead by replacing the expensive remote communication method with inexpensive intra-cluster communication.}

	abstract = {With the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), many industrial facilities have realized remote control and monitoring. However, the widespread of CPSs has brought new issues and challenges in terms of security. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities induced by network communication, tamper with transmitted data, and cause serious accidents through carefully designed covert attacks. This paper proposes a residual-driven comprehensive defense scheme based on the coprime factorization technique to address the threat posed by concealed CPS attacks. The novel scheme protects CPS from stealth cyber-physical attacks through secure transmission and attack detection. In particular, a secure transmission method is first introduced to prevent information leakage from the source. The pivotal idea is to convert confidential transmission control and measurement signals into non-essential filtered residual signals. It contributes to the reduction of information leakage and helps reduce the risks of stealth attacks. Then, under the same residual-driven framework, a stealth attack detection approach is put forward. It can eliminate false alarms caused by system faults, and therefore, achieve superior efficacy in detection accuracy under stealth attacks. Finally, simulation research is conducted on the F-404 engine to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme and approach.}

	abstract = {Due to the immense benefits of guaranteeing user privacy, popular messaging platforms have shown enthusiasm for deploying End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). However, E2EE could be misused for bypassing media moderation, opening a shortcut for the viral spreading of harmful media. Private hash-matching techniques are proposed to identify harmful content in E2EE. Unfortunately, the pioneering solution incurs prohibitively high latency due to redundant user-cloud interactions for a private inspection. In this paper, we design Entbergen for efficient inspection of E2EE media by differentially handling harmless and harmful ingredients. For this, a novel Private-2D BloOm filter with Fuzzy Query (PBO-FQ) is designed for local, agile, and private media hash matching. It is proposed as the first structure that adapts inverted index and differential privacy (DP) towards seamless integration of sketch and mask encoding. With PBO-FQ, Entbergen can instantly filter out harmless media and only pays attention to the small-scale counterparts by scrutinizing them privately based on homomorphic encryption. Security analysis shows that Entbergen can effectively fulfil the desired privacy requirements. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Entbergen is sufficiently efficient (w.r.t. computation and communication overhead) for working on mobile devices and can easily scale to real-world inspection with a large database.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the secrecy performance for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted downlink multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, consisting of multiple legitimate users and eavesdroppers. We propose two STAR-RIS-NOMA schemes for maximizing the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the transmission and reflection beamforming of the STAR-RIS, the transmit beamforming of the base station (BS), the power allocation coefficients and the user pairing vector under the full channel state information (CSI) and the statistical CSI of the eavesdropping channel, respectively. For the full CSI available to the BS, an alternating beamforming algorithm is proposed for maximizing the secrecy sum rate. Specifically, we first propose a user pairing scheme based on the differences of user’s channel gains. Then the beamforming vectors and the power allocation coefficients are optimized based on the techniques of semidefinite programming and surrogate lower bound approximation, respectively. For the statistical CSI available to the BS, the problem of minimizing the maximum secrecy outage probability (SOP) is investigated. By invoking the subroutines of alternating beamforming algorithm, we first derive an exact SOP given the user pairing. Then, we conceive the beamforming vectors and the power allocation coefficients by linear matrix inequality and linear programming, respectively. Simulation results show that: 1) the secrecy performance of the proposed STAR-RIS-NOMA scheme outperforms the existing conventional RIS-NOMA scheme and RIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (RIS-OMA) scheme; 2) the proposed alternating beamforming algorithm is capable of achieving a near-optimal performance with low complexity compared to the exhaustive search.}

	abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) combined with federated learning, as an emerging data collection and intelligent process paradigm, has received lots of attention in social networks and mobile Internet-of-Things, etc. However, as the openness and transparent of mobile crowdsensing tasks, federated learning model and training samples for crowdsensing data still face enormous privacy revealing risks, and it will reduce the willingness of people or nodes to actively participate and provide data in MCS. In this paper, we present a Privacy-Enhanced Aggregation for Federated Learning in MCS, namely PrivacyEAFL, to implement the training of federated learning under mobile crowdsensing system in terms of privacy protection of all participants. Firstly, considering that the crowdsensing server might share information with some participants to obtain and leak some local models, we design a collusion-resistant data aggregation approach by combining homomorphic cryptosystem and hashed Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Secondly, we design a data encoding and aggregating method with data packing which can reduce the computation cost and communication overhead for the system. Thirdly, as the number of participants’ samples are dynamically changeable in MCS, we design a sample number protection method that can implement the security and privacy of the number of training samples owned by participants. Finally, we provide the experimental results on real-world datasets (i.e, MNIST and Car Evaluation) with crowdsensing devices under Raspberry-Pi 4B and Redmi-K30 Pro, respectively, and the results demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient and practical in secure and privacy-enhanced model aggregation for federated learning in mobile crowdsensing.}

	abstract = {Early and accurate detection of network intrusions is crucial to ensure network security and stability. Existing network intrusion detection methods mainly use conventional machine learning or deep learning technology to classify intrusions based on the statistical features of network flows. The feature extraction relies on expert experience and cannot be performed until the end of network flows, which delays intrusion detection. The existing graph-based intrusion detection methods require global network traffic to construct communication graphs, which is complex and time-consuming. Besides, the existing deep learning-based and graph-based intrusion detection methods resort to massive training samples. This paper proposes Graph2vec+RF, an early and accurate network intrusion detection method based on graph embedding technology. We construct a flow graph from the initial several interactive packets for each bidirectional network flow instead, adopt graph embedding technology, graph2vec, to learn the vector representation of the flow graph and classify the graph vectors with Random Forest (RF). Graph2vec+RF automatically extracts flow graph features using subgraph structures and relies on only a small number of the initial interactive packets per bidirectional network flow without requiring massive training samples to achieve early and accurate network intrusion detection. Our experimental results on the CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018 datasets show that our proposed Graph2vec+RF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.}

	abstract = {Due to limited memory usage and provably high accuracy, sketches running on programmable switches have been commonly used by the literature for network measurement. However, their vulnerabilities are still largely unknown and neglected, which is highly concerning given the increasing popularity of network measurement. In this paper, we identify the Stalker attacks, where attackers aim to degrade the accuracy of sketches running on programmable switches. More precisely, attackers tamper with some sketch operations during sketch deployment atop programmable switches. At runtime, the tampered sketch will record highly inaccurate flow data, which degrades measurement accuracy. We implement Stalker attacks on Tofino switches. The results indicate that Stalker attacks significantly drop the accuracy of network management applications, e.g., reducing the F1 score of heavy hitter detection to zero. However, our analysis indicates that none of existing methods can detect Stalker attacks since they can hardly verify the correctness of sketch operations. Finally, we analyze potential defense mechanisms and identify challenges to enable further research in this context.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), and the requirement of individual privacy motivates the protection of subjects where the individual data is distributed across multiple users in the cross-silo FL setting. In this paper, we propose a subject-level membership inference attack based on data augmentation and model discrepancy. It can effectively infer whether the data distribution of the target subject has been sampled and used for training by specific federated users, even if other users (also) may sample from the same subject and use it as part of their training set. Specifically, the adversary uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform data augmentation on a small amount of priori federation-associated information known in advance. Subsequently, the adversary merges two different outputs from the global and tested user models using an optimal feature construction method. We simulate a controlled federation configuration and conduct extensive experiments on real datasets that include both image and categorical data. Results show that the area under the curve (AUC) is improved by 12.6% to 16.8% compared to the classical membership inference attack. This is at the expense of the test accuracy of the data augmented with GAN, which is at most 3.5% lower than the real test data. We also explore the degree of privacy leakage between overfitted models and well-generalized models in the cross-silo FL setting and conclude experimentally that the former is more likely to leak individual privacy with a subject-level degradation rate of up to 0.43. Finally, we present two possible defense mechanisms to attenuate this newly discovered privacy risk.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple local clients to collaboratively train a global model, which can reduce privacy leakage by sharing model parameters instead of private datasets. However, recent works have revealed that gradient-based data reconstruction attacks, e.g., deep leakage from gradients (DLG), improved DLG (iDLG), and inverting gradients (IG), may still reveal private information by exploiting model parameters from a local client. Current privacy-preserving FL strategies, e.g., differential privacy or gradient compression, can handle such attacks to some extent, but seriously sacrifice their model accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving FL method, named privacy-encoded FL (PEFL), to combat such data reconstruction attacks without degrading the model performance. The key concept of PEFL is that each large weight matrix of the neural network model is decomposed into multiple cascading sub-matrices, which thus establishes a novel privacy-encoded mechanism by introducing an entangling nonlinear mapping between model gradients and raw data. As such, multiple sub-matrices are directly trained in parallel at the local clients, but only partial sub-matrices are reported to a global server, which suffices to reconstruct the global model whilst increasing the complexity of the coupling between the model parameters and raw data. We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy, security, and complexity of our method. As shown, it breaks the limit of classical defensive methods, by significantly reducing the risk of data reconstruction attacks yet not degrading the model performance. Compared to classical defenses, the proposed PEFL decreases the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the reconstructed data and the raw data by ~ 20dB, without sacrificing the test accuracy. As a new paradigm for privacy-preserving FL, our proposed method has great potential in privacy-demanding learning applications.}

	abstract = {Distributed learning (DL) emerges as machine learning and the Internet of Things develop quickly and widely. As edge servers pre-process and pre-learn the statistics, global servers can reduce costs, improve efficiency and output more precise results. However, to acquire high-quality and adequate data, servers should collect information from a number of end devices, which naturally leads to confidentiality and privacy problems during information transmission. If the private information or the data are compromised by malicious attackers, the users’ security and the network operation will all be in danger. To resolve this thorny challenge, numerous schemes have been put forward, adopting different cryptography technologies and aiming at aspects of security. However, many state-of-the-art schemes can hardly satisfy the security demands and are pointed out to be defective. Lately, Jiang et al. made an effort and proposed a certificateless signature scheme, as well as an authentication scheme for the purpose of solving the privacy issues. Unfortunately, in this paper, we point out that their schemes can hardly resist forgery attacks and ephemeral key leakage attacks. Further, we will propose an improved scheme noted as 2PCLA and change the method of generating the session key. Theoretical analysis and formal security analysis utilizing Tamarin analysis tool are provided to prove the security of 2PCLA scheme. Performance evaluation has been done from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The assessment results illustrate that 2PCLA can balance security properties with execution efficiency relatively well.}

	abstract = {Moving Target Defense and Cyber Deception emerged in recent years as two key proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target Defense (MTD) typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers. However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and avoided by adversaries. This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy, with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is effective in slowing down attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD techniques based on our findings.}

However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of a System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the hardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that uses an expansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of SoC. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power of the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry channels, to achieve significantly better detection performance than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based detectors. We leverage the concept of manifold hypothesis to analytically prove that adding non-core telemetry channels improves the separability of the benign and malware classes, resulting in performance gains. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from 723 benign applications and 1033 malware samples on a commodity Android Operating System (OS)-based mobile device. XMD improves over currently used HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data. XMD achieves the best detection performance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the detection rate of 80%, offered by the best performing signature-based Anti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.}

	abstract = {Blockchain, which originated with the Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention because of its decentralization, persistence, and anonymity. The execution environment of blockchain is isolated from the external world and requires “blockchain oracles”: agents that fetch information from the outside world. However, there is always the risk of oracles providing corrupt, malicious, or inaccurate data. To overcome this issue, this paper analyses the existing oracle working patterns, then introduces a decentralized autonomous oracle network (DAON) and its consensus protocol and noninteractive reputation maintenance and payment scheme. Meanwhile, the reputation and security monitoring services of DAON are designed to ensure the DAON provide trustworthy data services in a complex byzantine environment. The proposed method is verified by experiments on three applications. Using the proposed network, smart contracts on future blockchains could have reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs.}

	abstract = {Despite regularizing the Jacobians of neural networks to enhance model robustness has directly theoretical correlation with model prediction stability, a large defense performance gap exists when compared to the empirically perturbation-based adversarial training e.g. PGD-based, which enjoys nice discriminative saliency maps as well. To mitigate this issue, in this paper we first analyze the dilemma that the gradient map of its resulting model has no content hierarchy to mark out salient profile of input, as a negative signal of the obstructive for effective adversarial defense. Based on this, we argue that incorporating robust gradient-based saliency properties into regularized training may be helpful to reduce the performance gap. Specifically, we propose a simple method called Saliency-aware Gradient Regularization (SAGR), where a biased weight distribution strategy is introduced on positive gradient to structure and increase the impact of class-gradient components inside the Jacobian of model. The strategy maintains the dominant role of saliency-critical true-class gradient in learning process and differentiates diverse importance of gradient sensitivities that would localize input salient areas. Herein we interpret the sharpness of true-class sensitivity as robust recognition of more learning-relevant features e.g., regions containing dominant object in image for classification. Instead, false-class parts are considered as recognition-irrelevant nuisance factors e.g. the backgrounds, which are thus depressed with more strength. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and validate that distinguishment of sensitivities could further yield more robustness gain and sharper gradient saliency map.}

	abstract = {With the coming of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, malware attacks targeting IoT networks have posed serious threats to users. Recently, the emerging of edge computing have paved the way for new data processing paradigms in IoT networks, but it is still a challenge for deploying malware detection systems on the IoT devices. This paper develops an IoT malware detection system based on trust hybrid user-edge evaluation, namely MDHE. This system decomposes a large and complex deep learning model into two parts, which are deployed on edge servers and end devices, respectively. Specifically, a trust evaluation mechanism is used to select the trusted devices to participate the model training. Moreover, we develop a private feature generation that leverages a graph mining technology to extract the subgraph features, which then are perturbed by leveraging the differential privacy technology to prevent user privacy from leaking. Finally, we reconstruct the perturbed features on edge server, and propose a Capsule Network (CapsNet) to identify malware. Experimental results show that MDHE can effectively detect malware. Specifically, it can reduce sensitive inference while maintaining the utility of data.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a kind of stealthy, sophisticated, and long-term cyberattack that has brought severe financial losses and critical infrastructure damages. Existing works mainly focus on APT defense under stable network topologies, while the problem under time-varying dynamic networks (e.g., vehicular networks) remains unexplored, which motivates our work. Besides, the spatiotemporal dynamics in defense resources, complex attackers’ lateral movement behaviors, and lack of timely defense make APT defense a challenging issue under time-varying networks. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretical APT defense approach to promote real-time and optimal defense strategy-making under both periodic time-varying and general time-varying environments. Specifically, we first model the interactions between attackers and defenders in an APT process as a dynamic APT repair game, and then formulate the APT damage minimization problem as the precise prevention and control (PPAC) problem. To derive the optimal defense strategy under both latency and defense resource constraints, we further devise an online optimal control-based mechanism integrated with two backtracking-forward algorithms to fastly derive the near-optimal solution of the PPAC problem in real time. Extensive experiments are carried out, and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently obtain optimal defense strategy in 54481 ms under seven attack-defense interactions with 9.64% resource occupancy in stimulated periodic time-varying and general time-varying networks. Besides, even under static networks, our proposed scheme still outperforms existing representative APT defense approaches in terms of service stability and defense resource utilization.}
