	abstract = {Privacy-preserving techniques for processing sets of information have attracted the research community’s attention in recent years due to society’s increasing dependency on the availability of data at any time. One of the fundamental problems in set operations is known as Private Set Intersection (PSI). The problem requires two parties to compute the intersection between their sets while preserving correctness and privacy. Although several efficient two-party PSI protocols already exist, protocols for PSI in the multi-party setting (MPSI) currently scale poorly with a growing number of parties, even though this applies to many real-life scenarios. This paper fills this gap by proposing two multi-party protocols based on Bloom filters and threshold homomorphic PKEs, which are secure in the semi-honest model. The first protocol is a multi-party PSI, whereas the second provides a more subtle functionality - threshold multi-party PSI (T-MPSI) - which outputs items of the server that appear in at least some number of other private sets. The protocols are inspired by the Davidson-Cid protocol based on Bloom filters. We compare our MPSI protocol against Kolesnikov et al. , which is among the fastest known MPSI protocols. Our MPSI protocol performs better than Kolesnikov et al. in terms of run time, given that the sets are small and there is a large number of parties. Our T-MPSI protocol performs better than other existing works: the computational and communication complexities are linear in the number of elements in the largest set given a fixed number of colluding parties. We conclude that our MPSI and T-MPSI protocols are practical solutions suitable for emerging use-case scenarios with many parties, where previous solutions did not scale well.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a framework against inference attacks aimed at inferring the values of the controller gains of an active steering control system (ASCS). We first show that an adversary with access to the shared information by a vehicle, via a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), can reliably infer the values of the controller gains of an ASCS. This vulnerability may expose the driver as well as the manufacturer of the ASCS to severe financial and safety risks. To protect controller gains of an ASCS against inference attacks, we propose a randomized filtering framework wherein the lateral velocity and yaw rate states of a vehicle are processed by a filter consisting of two components: a nonlinear mapping and a randomizer. The randomizer randomly generates a pair of pseudo gains which are different from the true gains of the ASCS. The nonlinear mapping performs a nonlinear transformation on the lateral velocity and yaw rate states. The nonlinear transformation is in the form of a dynamical system with a feedforward-feedback structure which allows real-time and causal implementation of the proposed privacy filter. The output of the filter is then shared via the VANET. The optimal design of randomizer is studied under a privacy constraint that determines the protection level of controller gains against inference attacks, and is in terms of mutual information. It is shown that the optimal randomizer is the solution of a convex optimization problem. By characterizing the distribution of the output of the filter, it is shown that the statistical distribution of the filter’s output depends on the pseudo gains rather than the true gains. Using information-theoretic inequalities, we analyze the inference ability of an adversary in estimating the control gains based on the output of the filter. Our analysis shows that the performance of any estimator in recovering the controller gains of an ASCS based on the output of the filter is limited by the privacy constraint. The performance of the proposed privacy filter is compared with that of an additive noise privacy mechanism. Our numerical results show that the proposed privacy filter significantly outperforms the additive noise mechanism, especially in the low distortion regime.}

	abstract = {We present Poligraph, an intrusion-tolerant and decentralized fake news detection system. Poligraph aims to address architectural, system, technical, and social challenges of building a practical, long-term fake news detection platform. We first conduct a case study for fake news detection at authors’ institute, showing that machine learning-based reviews are less accurate but timely, while human reviews, in particular, experts reviews, are more accurate but time-consuming. This justifies the need for combining both approaches. At the core of Poligraph is two-layer consensus allowing seamlessly combining machine learning techniques and human expert determination. We construct the two-layer consensus using Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) and asynchronous threshold common coin protocols. We prove the correctness of our system in terms of conventional definitions of security in distributed systems (agreement, total order, and liveness) as well as new review validity (capturing the accuracy of news reviews). We also provide theoretical foundations on parameter selection for our system. We implement Poligraph and evaluate its performance on Amazon EC2 using a variety of news from online publications and social media. We demonstrate Poligraph achieves throughput of more than 5,000 transactions per second and latency as low as 0.05 second. The throughput of Poligraph is only marginally ( {4\\%}\n– {7\\%}\n) slower than that of an unreplicated, single-server implementation. In addition, we conduct a real-world case study for the review of fake and real news among both experts and non-experts, which validates the practicality of our approach.}

	abstract = {Iris pattern recognition has significantly improved the biometric authentication field due to its high stability and uniqueness. Such physical characteristics have played an essential role in security applications and other related areas. However, presentation attacks, also known as spoofing techniques, can bypass biometric authentication systems using artefacts such as printed images, artificial eyes, textured contact lenses, etc. Many liveness detection methods that improve the robustness of these systems have been proposed. The first International Iris Liveness Detection competition, where the effectiveness of liveness detection methods is evaluated, was first launched in 2013, and its latest iteration was held in 2020. In this paper, we present the approach that won the LivDet-Iris 2020 competition using two-class scenarios (bona fide iris images vs. presentation attack iris images). Additionally, we propose new three-class and four-class scenarios that complement the competition results. These methods use a serial architecture based on a MobileNetV2 modification, trained from scratch to classify bona fide iris images versus presentation attack images. The bona fide class consists of live iris images, whereas the attack presentation instrument classes consist of cadaver, printed, and contact lenses images, for a total of four species. All the images were pre-processed and weighted per class to present a fair evaluation. This approach is primarily focused on detecting the bona fide class over improving the detection of presentation attack instruments. For the two, three, and four classes scenarios BPCER 10 values of 0.99%, 0.16%, and 0.83% were obtained respectively, whereas for the BPCER 20 values of 3.09%, 0.16%, and 3.77% were obtained, with the best model overall being the proposed 3-class serial model. This work reaches competitive results according to the reported results in the LivDet-Iris 2020 competition.}

	abstract = {The physical layer security (PLS) of millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems is investigated, where the secure source-to-destination communication is assisted by an untrusted relay selected from a group of them and there are also several passive eavesdroppers (Eves) in the network. In the considered system model, while the distributions of the untrusted relays and Eves follow a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). To maximize the instantaneous secrecy rate, a novel joint relay selection and power allocation (JRP) method is developed where the destination and source aim for jamming the reception of both the untrusted relays and passive Eves. New expressions of the optimal power allocation (OPA) are derived for both non-colluding Eves (NCE) and colluding Eves (CE). Subsequently, by considering the impact of potential blockages, new closed-form equations are derived for analyzing the system’s ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for transmission over fading mmWave channels. Finally, numerical examples are provided for demonstrating the superiority of our proposed JRP method over the relevant benchmarks found in the literature. Interestingly, the ESR increases with the density of untrusted relays for both the NCE and CE scenarios, which is a benefit of the improved probability of selecting a relay with a stronger second-hop channel. Furthermore, in the low transmit power regime, employing relatively low mmWave frequencies achieves better ESR, while in the high transmit power regime, high mmWave frequencies provide higher ESR.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving Faster R-CNN framework (SecRCNN) for object detection in medical images. Faster R-CNN is one of the most outstanding deep learning models for object detection. Using SecRCNN, healthcare centers can efficiently complete privacy-preserving computations of Faster R-CNN via the additive secret sharing technique and edge computing. To implement SecRCNN, we design a series of interactive protocols to perform the three stages of Faster R-CNN, namely feature map extraction, region proposal and regression and classification. To improve the efficiency of SecRCNN, we improve the existing secure computation sub-protocols involved in SecRCNN, including division, exponentiation and logarithm. The newly proposed sub-protocols can dramatically reduce the number of messages exchanged during the iterative approximation process based on the coordinate rotation digital computer algorithm. Moreover, the effectiveness, efficiency and security of SecRCNN are demonstrated through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. The experimental findings show that the communication overhead in computing division, logarithm and exponentiation decreases to 36.19%, 73.82% and 43.37%, respectively.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the role of secret key with finite rate is studied to enhance the secrecy performance of the system when users are operating in interference limited scenarios. To address this problem, a 2-user Gaussian Z-interference channel with secrecy constraint at the receiver is considered. The paper proposes novel achievable schemes, where the schemes differ from each other based on how the key has been used in the encoding process. The first achievable scheme uses a combination of key rate splitting , one-time pad , stochastic encoding and superposition coding . In this scheme, one part of the key is used for one-time pad and the remaining part of the key is used for stochastic encoding. The encoding is performed such that the receiver experiencing interference can decode some part of the interference without violating the secrecy constraint. As a special case of the derived result, one can obtain the secrecy rate region when the key is completely used for one-time pad or part of the stochastic encoding. The second scheme uses the shared key to encrypt the message using one-time pad and in contrast to the previous case no interference is decoded at the receiver. The paper also derives outer bound on the sum rate and secrecy rate. The main novelty of deriving outer bound lies in the selection of side information provided to the receiver and using the secrecy constraint. The derived outer bounds are found to be tight for certain channel conditions and rate of the key. The scaling behaviour of key rate is also explored for different schemes using the notion of secure generalized degrees of freedom . The optimality of different schemes are characterized for some specific cases. The developed results show the importance of key rate splitting in enhancing the secrecy performance of the system.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications are highly promising to improve the capacity of modern wireless networks, while the physical layer security (PLS) techniques hold great potential to enhance the critical secrecy performance therein. By carefully exploiting the significant signal difference between the Non-Light-of-Sight (NLoS) and Line-of-Sight (LoS) mmWave links, this paper proposes a Sight-based Cooperative Jamming (SCJ) scheme to improve the PLS performance of mmWave ad hoc communications. In this scheme, each potential jammer that has no LoS link to its nearest receiver but may have LoS links to eavesdroppers is selected with a certain probability to generate artificial noise such that channel advantages at legitimate receivers can be achieved. For performance modeling of the new jamming scheme, novel and efficient theoretical approximation approaches are firstly developed to enable the challenging issue of interference distribution modeling to be tackled, and then a theoretical framework based on stochastic geometry is proposed to capture the secrecy transmission capacity behavior under the SCJ scheme. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to illustrate the SCJ scheme under various network scenarios.}

However, these methods often suffer from the challenging factors in videos, such as serious occlusion, background clutter and pose variation. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-level Context-aware Part Attention (CPA) model to learn discriminative and robust local part features. It is featured in two aspects: 1) the context-aware part attention module improves the robustness by capturing the global relationship among different body parts across different video frames, and 2) the attention module is further extended to multi-level attention mechanism which enhances the discriminability by simultaneously considering low- to high-level features in different convolutional layers. In addition, we propose a novel multi-head collaborative training scheme to improve the performance, which is collaboratively supervised by multiple heads with the same structure but different parameters. It contains two consistency regularization terms, which consider both multi-head and multi-frame consistency to achieve better results. The multi-level CPA model is designed for feature extraction, while the multi-head collaborative training scheme is designed for classifier supervision. They jointly improve our re-ID model from two complementary directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better or at least comparable performance compared to the state-of-the-art on four video re-ID datasets.}

	abstract = {Media reports have accused face recognition of being “biased”, “sexist” and “racist”. There is consensus in the research literature that face recognition accuracy is lower for females, who often have both a higher false match rate and a higher false non-match rate. However, there is little published research aimed at identifying the cause of lower accuracy for females. For instance, the 2019 Face Recognition Vendor Test that documents lower female accuracy across a broad range of algorithms and datasets also lists “Analyze cause and effect” under the heading “What we did not do”. We present the first experimental analysis to identify major causes of lower face recognition accuracy for females on datasets where previous research has observed this result. Controlling for equal amount of visible face in the test images mitigates the apparent higher false non-match rate for females. Additional analysis shows that makeup-balanced datasets further improves females to achieve lower false non-match rates. Finally, a clustering experiment suggests that images of two different females are inherently more similar than of two different males, potentially accounting for a difference in false match rates.}

To extract domain-invariant features for unseen domains, this work proposes a Dual-Branch Meta-learning Network (DBMNet) with distribution alignment for face anti-spoofing. Specifically, DBMNet consists of a feature embedding (FE) branch and a depth estimating (DE) branch for real and fake face discrimination. Each branch acts as a meta-learner and is optimized by step-adjusted meta-learning that can adaptively select the best number of meta-train steps. In order to mitigate distribution discrepancies between domains, we introduce two distribution alignment losses to directly regularize the two meta-learners, i.e. , the triplet loss for FE branch and the depth loss for DE branch, respectively. Both of them are designed as part of the meta-train and meta-test objectives, which contribute to higher-order derivatives on the parameters during the meta-optimization for further seeking domain-invariant features. Extensive ablation studies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of our method for better generalization.}

These data are typically expressed in form of tensors, but there is no principled way to guarantee privacy for tensor-valued queries. Conventional differential privacy is typically applied to scalar values without a precise definition on the shape of the queried data. Realizing that the conventional mechanisms do not take the data structural information into account, we propose Tensor Variate Gaussian (TVG), a new\n(ϵ,δ)\n-differential privacy mechanism for tensor-valued queries. We further introduce two mechanisms based on TVG with an improved utility by imposing the unimodal differentially-private noise. With the utility space available, the proposed mechanisms can be instantiated with an optimized utility, and the optimization problem has a closed-form solution scalable to large-scale problems. Finally, we experimentally test our mechanisms on a variety of datasets and models, demonstrating that TVG is superior than other state-of-the-art mechanisms on tensor-valued queries.}

	abstract = {We study a statistical signal processing privacy problem, where an agent observes useful data\nY\nand wants to reveal the information to a user. Since the useful data is correlated with the private data\nX\n, the agent employs a privacy mechanism to generate data\nU\nthat can be released. We study the privacy mechanism design that maximizes the revealed information about\nY\nwhile satisfying a strong\nℓ\n1\n-privacy criterion. When a sufficiently small leakage is allowed, we show that the optimizer distributions of the privacy mechanism design problem have a specific geometry, i.e., they are perturbations of fixed vector distributions. This geometrical structure allows us to use a local approximation of the conditional entropy. By using this approximation the original optimization problem can be reduced to a linear program so that an approximate solution for the optimal privacy mechanism can be easily obtained. The main contribution of this work is to consider a non-invertible leakage matrix with non-zero leakage. In our first example, inspired by a watermark application, we first demonstrate the accuracy of the approximation. Then, we employ different measures for utility and privacy leakage to compare the privacy-utility trade-off using our approach with other methods. In particular, we show that by allowing small leakage, significant utility can be achieved using our method compared to the case where no leakage is allowed. In the second and third examples which are based on the MNIST data set and medical applications, we illustrate the suggested design for disclosed data\nU\n. It has been shown that the letters of\nY\nwhich are disclosing more information about\nX\nare combined (randomized) to produce a new letter of\nU\n.}

	abstract = {In this work, we present polar code designs that offer a provably optimal solution for biometric identification and authentication systems under noisy enrollment for certain sources and observation channels. We consider a discrete memoryless biometric source and discrete symmetric memoryless observation channels. It is shown that the proposed polar code designs achieve the fundamental limits with privacy and secrecy constraints. Depending on how the secret keys are extracted and whether the privacy leakage rate should be close to zero, we consider four related setups, which are (i) the generated secret key system, (ii) the chosen secret key system, (iii) the generated secret key system with zero leakage, and (iv) the chosen secret key system with zero leakage. For the first two setups, (i) and (ii), the privacy level is characterized by the privacy leakage rate. For the last two setups (iii) and (iv), private keys are additionally employed to achieve close to zero privacy leakage rate. In setups (i) and (iii), it is assumed that the secret keys are generated, i.e., extracted from biometric information. While in setups (ii) and (iv), secret keys provided to the system are chosen uniformly at random from some trustful source. This work provides the first examples of fundamental limits-achieving code designs for identification and authentication. Moreover, since the code designs are based on polar codes and many existing works study low-complexity and short block-length polar coding, the proposed code designs in this work provide the code design structure and a framework for the application of biometric identification and authentication.}

This paper presents an end-to-end automated system, called C2CL, comprised of a mobile finger photo capture app, preprocessing, and matching algorithms to handle the challenges inhibiting previous cross-matching methods; namely i) low ridge-valley contrast of contactless fingerprints, ii) varying roll, pitch, yaw, and distance of the finger to the camera, iii) non-linear distortion of contact-based fingerprints, and vi) different image qualities of smartphone cameras. Our preprocessing algorithm segments, enhances, scales, and unwarps contactless fingerprints, while our matching algorithm extracts both minutiae and texture representations. A sequestered dataset of 9, 888 contactless 2D fingerprints and corresponding contact-based fingerprints from 206 subjects (2 thumbs and 2 index fingers for each subject) acquired using our mobile capture app is used to evaluate the cross-database performance of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, additional experimental results on 3 publicly available datasets show substantial improvement in the state-of-the-art for contact to contactless fingerprint matching (TAR in the range of 96.67% to 98.30% at FAR=0.01%).}

	abstract = {Channel reciprocity-based key generation (CRKG) has recently emerged as a new technique to address the problem of key distribution in wireless networks. However, as this approach relies upon the characteristics of fading channels, the corresponding secret key rate may be low when the communication link is blocked. To enhance the applicability of CRKG in harsh propagation scenarios, this paper introduces a novel multiuser key generation scheme, which is referred to as RIS-assisted multiuser key generation (RMK) that leverages the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for appropriately shaping the environment and enhancing the sum secret key rate between an access point and multiple users. In the RMK scheme, an RIS-induced channel, rather than the direct channel, serves as the key source. We derive a general closed-form expression of the secret key rate and optimize the configuration of the RIS to maximize the sum secret key rate over independent and correlated fading channels in the presence of multiple users. In the presence of independent fading, we introduce a low-complexity algorithm based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. In the presence of correlated fading, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle it, we propose a new optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RMK scheme outperforms existing RIS-assisted algorithms and achieves a near-optimal sum secret key rate over independent and correlated fading channels.}

	abstract = {Fingerprint retrieval aims to identify a query fingerprint image in a large database using indexing algorithms. Because of the abundant level 3 pore features within high-resolution fingerprint images, pore-based fingerprint retrieval algorithms have been rapidly developed. These retrieval algorithms, however, suffer from severe calculation-consuming problems with the pores increasing. This paper proposes a pore-based fingerprint retrieval method for high-resolution fingerprint images. The proposed method consists of two main steps. 1) In the pore indexing step, an indexing space is constructed using the binary codes of pores in enrolled images. Then, a designed graph-based searching algorithm searches the nearest neighbors of pores from the query image to construct one-to-many correspondences. 2) In the refinement step, the one-to-many correspondences are refined by a random walker-based graph comparison algorithm to remove the false correspondences. The remained nearest neighbors are used to calculate the similarities between the query image and the enrolled images. The proposed method is evaluated on two databases, showing that our method achieves better retrieval accuracies with a higher speed than the existing pore-based retrieval algorithms.}

	abstract = {The advances in machine learning have revealed its great potential for emerging mobile applications such as face recognition and voice assistant. Models trained via a Neural Network (NN) can offer accurate and efficient inference services for mobile users. Unfortunately, the current deployment of such service encounters privacy concerns. Directly offloading the model to the mobile device violates model privacy of the model owner, while feeding user input to the service compromises user privacy. To address this issue, we propose Leia, a lightweight cryptographic NN inference system at the edge. Leia is designed from two mobile-friendly perspectives. First, it leverages the paradigm of edge computing wherein the inference procedure keeps the model closer to the mobile user to foster low latency service. Specifically, Leia’s architecture consists of two non-colluding edge services to obliviously perform NN inference on the encoded user data and model. Second, Leia’s realization makes the judicious use of potentially constrained computational and communication resources in edge devices. We adapt the Binarized Neural Network (BNN), a trending flavor of NN with low inference overhead, and purely choose the lightweight secret sharing techniques to realize secure blocks of BNN. We implement Leia and deploy it on Raspberry Pi. Empirical evaluations on benchmark and medical datasets via various models demonstrate the practicality of Leia.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) secure communication system with the assistance of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Compared with the traditional FD system, the IRS-assisted FD communication not only greatly improves the spectrum efficiency but also provides a new way to enhance physical layer security due to the overlapping of multiple signals at the eavesdropper. Furthermore, we consider a more practical scenario without perfect channel state information (CSI) because it is very difficult to obtain the perfect CSI especially for cascaded channels via IRS. In addition, the eavesdropper is usually passive and hidden which will not actively exchange CSI with the user, which leads to an obstacle for obtaining the perfect CSI of eavesdropping channels. To this end, a worst-case achievable security rate (ASR) optimization problem is formulated under the bounded CSI error model. Due to the existence of non-convexity and highly coupled variables, this problem is extremely challenging. To directly tackle the nonconvexity of the considered optimization problem, similar to successive convex approximation (SCA), we first transform the original problem into its equivalent convex optimization problem directly, and finally obtain the optimal solution of the original non-convex problem by iteratively calculating the convex optimization problem. On this basis, we iteratively solve the transmission beamforming and IRS phase shift through Alternate Optimization (AO). In particular, when optimizing the phase shift coefficient, a penalty convex-concave procedure solution is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed robust secure beamforming scheme can effectively improve ASR, and also outperforms the nonrobust one.}

We employ a zeroth-order method to minimize the associated augmented Lagrangian function in the primal domain using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We show that the proposed algorithm, named distributed zeroth-order ADMM (D-ZOA), has intrinsic privacy-preserving properties. Most existing privacy-preserving distributed optimization/estimation algorithms exploit some perturbation mechanism to preserve privacy, which comes at the cost of reduced accuracy. Contrarily, by analyzing the inherent randomness due to the use of a zeroth-order method, we show that D-ZOA is intrinsically endowed with\n(ϵ,δ)−\ndifferential privacy. In addition, we employ the moments accountant method to show that the total privacy leakage of D-ZOA grows sublinearly with the number of ADMM iterations. D-ZOA outperforms the existing differentially-private approaches in terms of accuracy while yielding similar privacy guarantee. We prove that D-ZOA reaches a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose size depends on the privacy parameter. The convergence analysis also reveals a practically important trade-off between privacy and accuracy. Simulation results verify the desirable privacy-preserving properties of D-ZOA and its superiority over the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as its network-wide convergence.}

However, the lack of trusted labeled data has limited the performance of the current solutions in detecting fraud reviews. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as a semi-supervised method has been demonstrated to be effective for data augmentation purposes. The state-of-the-art solutions utilize GANs to overcome the data scarcity problem. However, they fail to incorporate the behavioral clues in fraud generation. Additionally, state-of-the-art approaches overlook the possible bot-generated reviews in the dataset. Finally, they also suffer from a common limitation in the generalization and stability of the GAN, slowing down the training procedure. In this work, we propose ScoreGAN for fraud review detection that makes use of both review text and review rating scores in the generation and detection process. Scores are incorporated through Information Gain Maximization (IGM) into the loss function for three reasons. One is to generate score-correlated reviews based on the scores given to the generator. Second, the generated reviews are employed to train the discriminator, allowing the discriminator to correctly label the possible bot-generated reviews through joint representations learned from the concatenation of GLobal Vector for Word representation (GLoVe) extracted from the text and the score. Finally, it can be used to improve the stability and generalization of the GAN. Results show that the proposed framework outperformed the existing state-of-the-art FakeGAN framework, in terms of AP by 7%, and 5% on the Yelp and TripAdvisor datasets, respectively.}

Despite the undoubted advantages offered by coding, reliability and security are jeopardized by a pollution attack that can easily disrupt the entire system and degrade performance. In this paper we take an abstract view of a DSS and we investigate by means of mathematical modeling what are the availability, robustness, and timeliness of heterogeneous, coding-based DSS when storage nodes (SN) are unreliable and can be malicious. To this end, we focus on a class of allocations of coded fragments to SNs that we call feasible allocations ; the model takes into account both reliability and reactivity of SNs. We define robust availability and timeliness of feasible allocations that we use to characterize the overall performance and robustness of the DSS in a reference scenario. Our analysis reveals that code redundancy is a double-edged sword in a DSS where malicious SNs come into play and that there exists an optimal value of code redundancy regardless all system parameters that maximizes the number of malicious SNs that can be tolerated to achieve maximum DSS performance. We also found that larger codes are preferred over short ones as they yield superior DSS performance in the presence of malicious SNs. Furthermore, when multiple feasible allocations yield the highest DSS performance timeliness can be used as a guide for the choice. Finally, heterogeneity plays a role in determining the timeliness of the maximally spread allocations in the case of targeted attacks.}

	abstract = {Gradient leakage attacks are considered one of the wickedest privacy threats in deep learning as attackers covertly spy gradient updates during iterative training without compromising model training quality, and yet secretly reconstruct sensitive training data using leaked gradients with high attack success rate. Although deep learning with differential privacy is a defacto standard for publishing deep learning models with differential privacy guarantee, we show that differentially private algorithms with fixed privacy parameters are vulnerable against gradient leakage attacks. This paper investigates alternative approaches to gradient leakage resilient deep learning with differential privacy (DP). First, we analyze existing implementation of deep learning with differential privacy, which use fixed noise variance to injects constant noise to the gradients in all layers using fixed privacy parameters. Despite the DP guarantee provided, the method suffers from low accuracy and is vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks. Second, we present a gradient leakage resilient deep learning approach with differential privacy guarantee by using dynamic privacy parameters. Unlike fixed-parameter strategies that result in constant noise variance, different dynamic parameter strategies present alternative techniques to introduce adaptive noise variance and adaptive noise injection which are closely aligned to the trend of gradient updates during differentially private model training. Finally, we describe four complementary metrics to evaluate and compare alternative approaches. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that differentially private deep learning with dynamic privacy parameters outperforms the deep learning using fixed DP parameters, and existing adaptive clipping approaches in all aspects: compelling accuracy performance, strong differential privacy guarantee, and high attack resilience.}

	abstract = {As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.}

	abstract = {Our main contribution is the design of a spread spectrum random access scheme without pre-shared secret with asymptotically guaranteed availability against electronic/cyber-based jamming attacks. In order to establish asymptotic anti-jamming guarantees, first we develop the system model and show that for reactive jamming (only limited by the laws of physical propagation), the required location for a successful attack can be controlled by design. Then, for non-reactive protocol-aware jamming, we map a random selection of (publicly known) spreading codes to the computational birthday problem. Differently to the related literature, we formulate the birthday problem using entropic measures (Rényi entropy), which allows to obtain the optimal spreading code set sizes that guarantee asymptotically zero collision probability. Accordingly, the birthday attack is the best strategy to optimize the (trial and error) blind acquisition at the legitimate detector. We obtain numerical results that illustrate how to use our entropic method as a system design degree of freedom to identify realistic spreading code set sizes. We also derive an upper bound of the detection latency. Finally, we show that the resulting anti-jamming throughput is higher than the throughput under conventional operation (i.e. without anti-jamming guarantees) due to the control of collision probability by-design.}

	abstract = {Clustering-based approaches have been successfully applied to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks for person re-identification (Re-ID), where no annotations are provided in target domain. However, the clustering process is sensitive to noises, leading to imperfect pseudo labels that could damage the training performance. In this work, we propose a Multi-view Evolutionary Training (MET) method to effectively reduce noises in clustering results from two dimensions. First, to improve the clustering accuracy at each time frame (i.e. snapshot quality), a Multi-view Diffusion (MvD) module is proposed. Through capturing data relationships from multiple viewpoints and aggregating their information, noises and bias from each individual viewpoint can be eliminated, and more reliable similarity matrix can be produced for clustering. Second, to improve the temporal consistency between clustering at different iterations, i.e. temporal consistency, we propose an Evolutionary Local Refinement (ELR) module, which utilizes the previous clustering results to guide and improve current results, and further make the training process more stable and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can provide clustering results with high quality, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on UDA Re-ID.}

	abstract = {Cybersecurity in front of attacks to a face recognition system is an emerging issue in the cloud era, especially due to its strong bonds with the privacy of the users registered to the system. A possible attack is the model inversion attack (MIA) which aims to reveal the identity of a targeted user by generating the most proper datapoint input to the system with maximum corresponding confidence score at the output. The generated data of a registered user can be maliciously used as a serious invasion of the user privacy. In literature, MIA processes are categorized into white-box and black-box scenarios which are respectively with and without information about the system structure, parameters, and partially about the users. This research work assumes the MIA under semi-white box scenario of availability of system model structure and parameters but not any user data information, and verifies it as a severe threat even for a deep-learning-based face recognition system despite its complex structure and the diversity of registered user data. The alert state is promoted by Deep MIA which is the integration of deep generative models in MIA, and $\\alpha $ -GAN integrated MIA-initilized by a face based seed ( $\\alpha $ -GAN-MIA-FS) is proposed. As a novel MIA search strategy, a pre-trained deep generative model with capability of generating a face image from a random feature vector is used for narrowing down the image search space to the feature vectors space, which has much lower dimensions. This allows the MIA process to efficiently search for a low-dimensional feature vector whose corresponding face image maximizes the confidence score. We have experimentally evaluated the proposed method by two objective criteria and three subjective criteria in comparison to $\\alpha $ -GAN-integrated MIA initialized with a random seed ( $\\alpha $ -GAN-MIA-RS), DCGAN-integrated MIA (DCGAN-MIA), and the conventional MIA. The evaluation results approve the efficiency and superiority of the proposed technique in generating natural looking face clones with high recognizability as the targeted users.}

	abstract = {Many adversarial attacks produce floating-point tensors which are no longer adversarial when converted to raster or JPEG images due to rounding. This paper proposes a method dedicated to quantize adversarial perturbations. This “smart” quantization is conveniently implemented as versatile post-processing. It can be used on top of any white-box attack targeting any model. Its principle is tantamount to a constrained optimization problem aiming to minimize the quantization error while keeping the image adversarial after quantization. A Lagrangian formulation is proposed and an appropriate search of the Lagrangian multiplier enables to increase the success rate. We also add a control mechanism of the\nℓ\n∞\n-distortion. Our method operates in both spatial and JPEG domains with little complexity. This study shows that forging adversarial images is not a hard constraint: our quantization does not introduce any extra distortion. Moreover, adversarial images quantized as JPEG also challenge defenses relying on the robustness of neural networks against JPEG compression.}

	abstract = {Matching the daytime visible and nighttime infrared person images, namely visible infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID), is a challenging cross-modality retrieval problem. Due to the difficulty of data collection and annotation in nighttime surveillance, VI-ReID usually suffers from noise problems, making it challenging to directly learn part discriminative features. In order to improve the discriminability and enhance the robustness against noisy images, this paper proposes a novel dynamic tri-level relation mining (DTRM) framework by simultaneously exploring channel-level, part-level intra-modality, and graph-level cross-modality relation cues. To address the misalignment within the person images, we design an intra-modality weighted-part attention (IWPA) to construct part-aggregated representation. It adaptively integrates the body part relation into the local feature learning with a residual batch normalization (RBN) connection scheme. Besides, a cross-modality graph structured attention (CGSA) is incorporated to improve the global feature learning by utilizing the contextual relation between images from two modalities. This module reduces the negative effects of noisy images. To seamlessly integrate two components, a parameter-free dynamic aggregation strategy is designed in a progressive joint learning manner. To further improve the performance, we additionally design a simple yet effective channel-level learning strategy by exploiting the rich channel information of visible images, which significantly reinforces the performance without modifying the network structure or changing the training process. Extensive experiments on two visible infrared re-identification datasets have verified the effectiveness under various settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/mangye16/DDAG}

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a salience-aware face presentation attack detection (SAFPAD) approach, which takes advantage of deep reinforcement learning to exploit the salient local part information in face images. Most existing deep face presentation attack detection approaches extract features from the entire image or several fixed regions. However, the discriminative information beneficial for presentation attack detection is unevenly distributed in the image due to the illumination and presentation attack instrument variation, so treating all regions equally fails to highlight the most discriminative information which is important for more accurate and robust face presentation attack detection. To address this, we propose to identify the discriminative salient parts using deep reinforcement learning and focus on them to alleviate the adverse effects of redundant information in the face images. We fuse the high-level features and the local features which guide the policy network to exploit discriminative patches and assist the classification network to predict more accurate results. We jointly train the SAFPAD model with deep reinforcement learning to generate salient locations. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves very competitive performance due to the concentrated employment of salient local information.}

At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob’s model includes all words (\nn=5200\n) and Alice’s SMS has at most\nm=160\nunigrams.

	abstract = {The increasing abuse of image editing software causes the authenticity of digital images questionable. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to report fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations, e.g., compression and resizing, adopted by OSNs impose great challenges for implementing the robust image forgery detection. To fight against the OSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust training scheme is proposed. Firstly, we design a baseline detector, which won the top ranking in a recent certificate forgery detection competition. Then we conduct a thorough analysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., predictable noise and unseen noise , which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the previous one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We further incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, significantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art competitors, especially in the scenarios of detecting OSN-transmitted forgeries. Finally, to promote the future development of the image forgery detection, we build a public forgeries dataset based on four existing datasets through the uploading and downloading of four most popular OSNs.

This technology, referred to as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), can be used to collect the physiological status of users who are in front of a camera, which may raise privacy concerns. To avoid the privacy abuse of the rPPG technology, this paper develops PulseEdit, a novel and efficient algorithm that can edit the physiological signals in facial videos without affecting visual appearance and thus protect the user’s physiological signal from disclosure. PulseEdit can either remove the trace of the physiological signal in a video or transform the video to contain a target physiological signal chosen by a user. Experimental results show that PulseEdit can effectively edit physiological signals in facial videos and prevent heart rate measurement based on rPPG. It is possible to utilize PulseEdit in adversarial scenarios against rPPG-based visual security algorithms. We present analyses on the performance of PulseEdit against rPPG-based liveness detection and rPPG-based deepfake detection, and demonstrate its ability to circumvent these visual security algorithms and its important role in supporting the design of attack-resilient systems.}

	abstract = {In the digital twin environment, the fusion data onto physical entities in the physical space are mapped to multiple virtual spaces for digital modeling and intelligent simulation in different dimensions. In real intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical. The experimental results show that BSPDP is effective and attractive for digital twin.}

Existing studies focused on optimized function deployment and management in NFV. Unfortunately, these studies did not well address the problem of efficient security function enforcement in networks, which is the goal of deploying network functions (NFs), i.e., for real-time security function enforcement on the traffic, since optimal function deployment does not mean efficient security function enforcement on network traffic. In particular, they incurred significant NF enforcement cost. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we propose\nFuncE\nthat aims to solve the efficient real-time security function enforcement problem by developing unified dynamic flow and function scheduling. We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming problem and prove that it is NP-hard. We tackle the problem by decomposing it and developing heuristics to achieve near-optimal solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments by using real topologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nFuncE\ndesign. The experimental results demonstrate that\nFuncE\nachieves near-optimal network function enforcement, which incurs over 100 times less latency than the existing the optimal solver. In particular, compared to the state-of-art defenses,\nFuncE\nprocesses the same number of candidate flows using over 50% less VNFs, while ensuring the same level of function enforcement.}

	abstract = {Deep face forgery and detection is an emerging topic due to the development of GANs. Face forgery detection relies greatly on existing databases for evaluation and adequate training examples for data-hungry machine learning algorithms. However, considering the wide application of face recognition in near-infrared scenarios, there is no publicly available face forgery database that includes near-infrared modality currently. In this paper, we present an attempt at constructing a large-scale dataset for face forgery detection in the near-infrared modality and propose a new forgery detection method based on knowledge distillation named cross-modality knowledge distillation aiming to use a teacher model which is pre-trained on the visible light-based (VIS) big data to guide the student model with a small amount of near-infrared (NIR) data. The proposed near-infrared face forgery dataset, named ForgeryNIR, contains a total of over 50,000 real and fake identities. A number of perturbations are applied to help simulate real-world scenarios. All source images in ForgeryNIR are collected from CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0, and fake images are generated via multiple GAN techniques. The proposed dataset fills the gap of face forgery detection research in the near-infrared modality. A comprehensive study on six representative detection baselines is conducted to evaluate the performance of face forgery detection algorithms in the NIR domain. We further construct a hard testing set, named ForgeryNIR+, which contains forged images that have bypassed existing face forgery detection methods. The proposed datasets will be publicly available and aim to help boost further research on face forgery detection, as well as NIR face detection and recognition.}

	abstract = {Practically, person re-identification (re-ID) may suffer from the critical spatial misalignment problem due to inaccurate human detection, variation on human pose and camera viewpoint, etc. To address this, a hierarchical discriminative spatial aggregation method is proposed. The key idea is to conduct spatial aggregation on local human parts via global average-pooling to acquire the strong spatial misalignment tolerance, with VALD encoding on the local parts for facilitating discriminative power jointly. This proposition is built on NetVLAD to ensure end-to-end deep learning capacity. Due to the fine-grained property of person re-ID task that has not been well concerned by the original NetVLAD model for scene recognition, a feature refinement layer that consists of 1 fully-connected (FC) layer and 2 batch normalization (BN) layers is added on top of the raw NetVLAD layer to enhance the discriminative power and training convergence. And, a human body occlusion and background component dropout manner is also proposed to resist the effect of serious occlusion. Technically, a refined codeword initialization manner is proposed to alleviate the potential codeword imbalance problem caused by naive random initialization. The proposed discriminative spatial aggregation approach is then conducted on multi-resolution convolutional feature map layers hierarchically via early feature fusion, to involve richer semantic and fine-grained visual clues jointly. Wide-range experiments on 6 datasets (i.e., CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID, Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market-1501, MSMT17 and Occluded-REID) verifies the effectiveness of our proposition.

	abstract = {Recommender system, as a data-driven way to help customers locate products that match their interests, is increasingly critical for providing competitive customer suggestions in many web services. However, recommender systems are highly vulnerable to malicious injection attacks due to their fundamental vulnerabilities and openness. With the endless emergence of new attacks, how to provide a feasible way for defending different malicious threats against online recommendations is still an under-explored issue. In this paper, we explore a new way to defend malicious injection attacks through user intention understanding and influential neighbour disclosure. Specifically, we propose a detection approach, termed TBOS ( T hree B irds with O ne S tone), to deal with different malicious threats. In TBOS , we first develop the discrimination of attack target by combining global influence evaluation and risk attitude estimation of users. In order to make TBOS controllable, second, we propose to incorporate an optimal denoising mechanism to remove disturbed information before detection. To enhance the representativeness and predictability of detection model, finally, we propose to leverage a behavioral label propagation mechanism based on constructed label space for the determination of malicious injection behaviors. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that TBOS outperforms all baselines in different cases. Particularly, the detection performance of TBOS can achieve an improvement of 6.08% FAR (false alarm rate) for optimal-injection attacks, an improvement of 3.83% FAR in average for co-visitation injection attacks, as well as an improvement of 2.3% for profile injection attacks over benchmarks in terms of FAR while keeping the highest DR (detection rate). Additional experiments on real-world data show that TBOS brings an improvement with the advantage of 6.5% FAR in average compared with baselines.}

Considering various face forgery methods could leave certain similar forgery traces in videos, we attempt to learn the common forgery features from different forgery databases, so as to achieve better generalization in the detection of unknown forgery methods. Firstly, the Specific Forgery Feature Extractors (SFFExtractors) are trained separately for each of given forgery methods. We utilize the U-net structure and consider the triplet loss, location loss, classification loss, and automatic weighted loss to ensure the detection ability of SFFExtractors on the corresponding forgery methods. Next, the Common Forgery Feature Extractor (CFFExtractor) is trained under the supervision of SFFExtractors to explore the commonality of the forgery traces caused by different forgery methods. The extracted common forgery feature is expected to have a good generalization. The experimental results on FaceForensic++ show that the SFFExtractors outperform many state-of-the-arts in face forgery detection. The generalization performance of the CFFExtractor is verified on FaceForensic++, DFDC, and CelebDF. It is proved that commonality learning can be an effective strategy to improve generalization.}

	abstract = {Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a technique that facilitates run-time data-flow analysis on a running process, allowing a system to overcome the limitations of finding data dependencies statically at compilation time. DIFT serves as the backbone for applications including data-flow integrity (DFI). However, previous uses of DIFT towards DFI often have large overhead in terms of hardware, software or both, and often cannot provide fine-granularity tracking for software object, such as variables. To address these limitations, we present FineDIFT as a DFI framework which utilizes DIFT to generate a live data-flow graph of a running process and perform hardware-based assisted analysis at fine-granularity, thus being able to enforce the application’s Data-Flow Graph (DFG). We provide a sample implementation on a RISC-V core with a performance overhead of 5.03% for BEEBS benchmarks and hardware overhead of 6% LUTs and 8% Flip-Flops in the FPGA implementation, if excluding the Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) like structure used for metadata storage. With CAM-like structure being synthesized using FPGA logic, the total hardware overhead is\n≈2×\nLUTs and 33% Flip-Flops compared to the original RISC-V core. We also use the real-world application and customized vulnerable application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in protecting computing systems.}

First, we study both the profiling complexity and the online attack complexity of different profiled distinguishers. Second, we extend the range of the noise levels of their experiments, in order to cover (higher-noise) contexts where masking is effective. Third, we further contextualize the investigated distinguishers (e.g., in terms of adversarial capabilities and a priori assumptions on the leakage probability density function). Finally, we complete the list of distinguishers considered in this previous work and add expectation-maximization, soft analytical side-channel attacks and multi-layer perceptrons in our comparisons. Our results allow shedding an interesting new light on the respective strengths and weaknesses of these different statistical tools, both in the context of a side-channel security evaluation and for concrete attacks. In particular, they confirm the experimental relevance of evaluation shortcuts leveraging the masking randomness during profiling, in order to speed up the evaluation process.}

	abstract = {We present a method to edit a target portrait footage by taking a sequence of audio as input to synthesize a photo-realistic video. This method is unique because it is highly dynamic. It does not assume a person-specific rendering network yet capable of translating one source audio into one random chosen video output within a set of speech videos. Instead of learning a highly heterogeneous and nonlinear mapping from audio to the video directly, we first factorize each target video frame into orthogonal parameter spaces, i.e. , expression, geometry, and pose, via monocular 3D face reconstruction. Next, a recurrent network is introduced to translate source audio into expression parameters that are primarily related to the audio content. The audio-translated expression parameters are then used to synthesize a photo-realistic human subject in each video frame, with the movement of the mouth regions precisely mapped to the source audio. The geometry and pose parameters of the target human portrait are retained, therefore preserving the context of the original video footage. Finally, we introduce a novel video rendering network and a dynamic programming method to construct a temporally coherent and photo-realistic video. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches. Our method is end-to-end learnable and robust to voice variations in the source audio.}

The area hosts a multitude of Internet of (Battlefield) Things (Io\nβT\n) objects. Alice and Bob perform random walks on a random regular graph. The Io\nβT\nobjects reside on the vertices of this graph, and some can serve as relays between Alice and Bob. The protocol starts with Alice splitting her message into small chunks, which she can covertly deposit to the relays she encounters. The protocol ends with Bob collecting the chunks. Alice may encode her data before the dissemination. Willie can either perform random walks as Alice and Bob do or conduct uniform surveillance of the area. In either case, he can only observe one relay at a time. We evaluate the system performance by the covertness probability and the message passing delay. In our protocol, Alice splits her message to increase the covertness probability and adds (coded) redundancy to reduce the transmission delay. The performance metrics depend on the graph, communications delay, and code parameters. We show that, in most scenarios, it is impossible to find the design parameters that simultaneously maximize the covertness probability and minimize the message delay.}

Combining the information from these endpoints can realize significant societal benefit but presents challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals, especially important in an increasingly regulated world. Differential privacy (DP) is a technique that provides a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for aggregation and release. The Shuffle Model for DP has been introduced to overcome challenges regarding the accuracy of local-DP algorithms and the privacy risks of central-DP. In this work we introduce a new protocol for vector aggregation in the context of the Shuffle Model. The aim of this paper is twofold; first, we provide a single message protocol for the summation of real vectors in the Shuffle Model, using advanced composition results. Secondly, we provide an improvement on the bound on the error achieved through using this protocol through the implementation of a Discrete Fourier Transform, thereby minimizing the initial error at the expense of the loss in accuracy through the transformation itself. This work will further the exploration of more sophisticated structures such as matrices and higher-dimensional tensors in this context, both of which are reliant on the functionality of the vector case.}

	abstract = {With the increasing number of wireless communication systems and the demand for bandwidth, the wireless medium has become a congested and contested environment. Operating under such an environment brings several challenges, especially for military communication systems, which need to guarantee reliable communication while avoiding interfering with other friendly or neutral systems and denying the enemy systems of service. In this work, we investigate a novel application of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) for joint communications and jamming with a Multi-Carrier (MC) waveform in a multi-antenna Cognitive Radio (CR) system. RSMA is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink multi-antenna wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. By employing RSMA at the secondary transmitter, our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Secondary Users (SUs) and jam Adversarial Users (AUs) to disrupt their communications while limiting the interference to Primary Users (PUs) in a setting where all users perform broadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We consider the practical setting of imperfect CSI at Transmitter (CSIT) for the SUs and PUs, and statistical CSIT for AUs. We formulate a problem to obtain optimal precoders which maximize the mutual information under interference and jamming power constraints. We propose an Alternating Optimization-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (AO-ADMM) based algorithm for solving the resulting non-convex problem. We perform an analysis based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the optimal jamming and interference power thresholds that guarantee the feasibility of problem and propose a practical algorithm to calculate the interference power threshold. By simulation results, we demonstrate that RSMA achieves a higher sum-rate performance than Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).}

We define a new attack method, called the malicious energy attack, where the attacker can charge specific nodes to manipulate routing paths. By intelligently selecting the victim nodes, the attacker can “encourage” most of the data traffic into passing through a compromised node and harm the information security. The performance of the energy attack depends on the charging strategies. We develop two reinforcement-learning enabled algorithms, namely, Q- learning enabled intelligent energy attack (Q-IEA) and Policy Gradient enabled intelligent energy attack (PG-IEA). Through interacting with the network environment, the attacker can intelligently take attack actions without knowing the private information of the IoT network. This can greatly enhance the adaptability of the attacker to different network settings. Simulation results verify that the proposed IEA methods can considerably increase the amount of traffic traveling through the compromised node. Compared with the network without attack, an additional 53.3% data traffic is lured to the compromised node, which is more than 4 times higher than the performance of Random Attack.}

In this paper, we propose two PSDMM schemes, where one is limited to the case that the shared library is stored across the servers in a replicated form but has a better performance than state-of-the-art schemes in that it can achieve a smaller recovery threshold and download cost. The other one focuses on the case that the shared library is stored across the servers in an MDS-coded form, which requires less storage in the servers. The second PSDMM code does not subsume the first one even if the underlying MDS code is degraded to a repetition code as they are totally two different schemes.}

	abstract = {Herein, design of false data injection attack on a distributed cyber-physical system is considered. A stochastic process with linear dynamics and Gaussian noise is measured by multiple agent nodes, each equipped with multiple sensors. The agent nodes form a multi-hop network among themselves. Each agent node computes an estimate of the process by using its sensor observation and messages obtained from neighboring nodes, via Kalman-consensus filtering. An external attacker, capable of arbitrarily manipulating the sensor observations of some or all agent nodes, injects errors into those sensor observations. The goal of the attacker is to steer the estimates at the agent nodes as close as possible to a pre-specified value, while respecting a constraint on the attack detection probability. To this end, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal parameter values of a certain class of linear attacks. The parameters of linear attack are learnt on-line via a combination of stochastic approximation based update of a Lagrange multiplier, and an optimization technique involving either the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions or online stochastic gradient descent. The problem turns out to be convex for some special cases. Desired convergence of the proposed algorithms are proved by exploiting the convexity and properties of stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the attack.}

Notably, we propose to exploit inherent ciphertext malleability properties of LWE/LWR-based PKEs as a powerful tool for side-channel assisted message recovery attacks. The use of ciphertext malleability widens the scope of previous attacks with the ability to target multiple operations for message recovery. Moreover, our attacks are adaptable to different implementation variants and are also applicable to implementations protected with concrete shuffling and masking side-channel countermeasures. Our work mainly highlights the presence of inherent algorithmic properties in LWE/LWR-based schemes that can aid side-channel attacks for message recovery, thereby stressing on the need for strong side-channel countermeasures against message recovery for LWE/LWR-based schemes.}

	abstract = {Advanced cyber attackers often “pivot” through several devices in such complex infrastructure to obfuscate their footprints and overcome connectivity restrictions. However, prior pivot attack detection strategies present concerning limitations. This paper addresses an improvement of cyber defence with APIVADS, a novel adaptive pivoting detection scheme based on traffic flows to determine cyber adversaries’ presence based on their pivoting behaviour in simple and complex interconnected networks. Additionally, APIVADS is agnostic regarding transport and application protocols. The scheme is optimized and tested to cover remotely connected locations beyond a corporate campus’s perimeters. The scheme considers a hybrid approach between decentralized host-based detection of pivot attacks and a centralized approach to aggregate the results to achieve scalability. Empirical results from our experiments show the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible. For example, a 98.54% detection accuracy near real-time is achievable by APIVADS differentiating ongoing pivot attacks from regular enterprise traffic as TLS, HTTPS, DNS and P2P over the internet.}

	abstract = {Source-data-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SF-UDA) is an approach to improve model performance in the target domain without accessing the source data. Some SF-UDA methods have been proposed and achieved promising results using the information from source-model parameters. However, current research on information security confirms the ability of a well-trained model to memorize its training data. Therefore, SF-UDA methods that access model parameters remain at risk of privacy disclosure. This paper introduces a new topic of source-protected UDA (SP-UDA) that adapts the source model to the target domain while protecting the source-domain data and model privacy. In SP-UDA, only a black-box source model and a set of unlabeled target data are available for domain adaptation. We consider SP-UDA from a new perspective of model memorization revelation. A Source-Protected Generative Model (SPGM) is developed to reveal task-relevant memorization from the source model. SPGM directly distills the inverse process of the source model without access to source-model parameters to meet the privacy protection objective in SP-UDA. The SPGM is learned under the supervision of a newly designed metric named privacy-protected transfer (PPT). The PPT metric measures the transferability and desensitization of the generated data to encourage the SPGM to extract task-relevant information rather than the unintended memorization. A set of desensitized pseudo data is then generated as substitutes for the real source data in UDA. The performance of the proposed method has been validated in four cross-dataset recognition applications with encouraging results.}

	abstract = {Most safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms depend on the accurate reward that is rarely available in wireless security applications and suffer from severe performance degradation for the learning agents that have to choose the policy from a large action set. In this paper, we propose a safe RL algorithm, which uses a policy priority-based hierarchical structure to divide each policy into sub-policies with different selection priorities and thus compresses the action set. By applying inter-agent transfer learning to initialize the learning parameters, this algorithm accelerates the initial exploration of the optimal policy. Based on a security criterion that evaluates the risk value, the sub-policy distribution formulation avoids the dangerous sub-policies that cause learning failure such as severe network security problems in wireless security applications, e.g., Internet services interruption. We also propose a deep safe RL and design four deep neural networks in each sub-policy selection to further improve the learning efficiency for the learning agents that support four convolutional neural networks (CNNs): The Q-network evaluates the long-term expected reward of each sub-policy under the current state, and the E-network evaluates the long-term risk value. The target Q and E-networks update the learning parameters of the corresponding CNN to improve the policy exploration stability. As a case study, our proposed safe RL algorithms are implemented in the anti-jamming communication of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to select the frequency channel and transmit power to the ground node. Experimental results show that our proposed schemes significantly improve the UAV communication performance, save the UAV energy and increase the reward compared with the benchmark against jamming.}

	abstract = {Protection of the design intellectual property (IP) has become a pertinent need owing to the globalized integrated circuit (IC) supply chain. Logic locking has been perceived as a holistic solution ensuring protection against multiple supply chain entities. The research community has proposed many logic locking techniques, out of which provably-secure logic locking (PSLL) techniques have gathered traction due to their algorithmic and mathematical security guarantees. However, there has been a perpetual cat-and-mouse game between the attackers and the defenders. Although these logic locking techniques are provably secure, they are typically short-lived due to the weaknesses in their hardware/structural implementation that attacks exploit. We attribute this cat-and-mouse game to the lack of a diagnostic tool for PSLL techniques for security-enforcing designers and raise the question, “ Can a designer proactively diagnose the hardware implementation of a PSLL technique for structural vulnerabilities before taking the design to silicon? ” In this work, we first review the recent PSLL techniques to extract generic properties, based on which we develop a first-of-its-kind security diagnostic tool ( Valkyrie ) that a security-enforcing designer can use to assess the structural vulnerabilities before taking the design to silicon. We also propose a generic circuit-recovery attack, validating the tool results to assure the community that if the tool identifies a vulnerability, it can always be exploited. Thus, our attack acts as a cautionary tale to the designer. We make these claims after verifying the efficacy of our tool and attack on 15 (seven broken and eight unbroken) PSLL techniques for different synthesis tools, technology libraries, and abstraction levels across a dataset of more than 20,000 locked designs. We observe 100% success in all these cases. Our diagnostic tool (which we open-source) can thus serve as a vehicle to test the structural resilience of the hardware implementation of any newly developed PSLL technique. We envision Valkyrie bringing a much-needed control over the cat-and-mouse game that the PSLL research has been trapped in.}

The device-specific hardware features can be extracted at the receiver by analyzing the received signal and used for authentication. In this paper, we propose a scalable and channel-robust RFFI framework achieved by deep learning powered radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) extractor and channel independent features. Specifically, we leverage deep metric learning to train an RFF extractor, which has excellent generalization ability and can extract RFFs from previously unseen devices. Any devices can be enrolled via the pre-trained RFF extractor and the RFF database can be maintained efficiently for allowing devices to join and leave. Wireless channel impacts the RFF extraction and is tackled by exploiting channel independent features and data augmentation. We carried out extensive experimental evaluation involving 60 commercial off-the-shelf LoRa devices and a USRP N210 software defined radio platform. The results have successfully demonstrated that our framework can achieve excellent generalization abilities for rogue device detection and device classification as well as effective channel mitigation.}

	abstract = {Learning on execution behaviour, i.e., sequences of API calls, is proven to be effective in malware detection. In this paper, we present CruParamer, a deep neural network based malware detection approach for Windows platform that performs learning on sequences of parameter-augmented APIs. It first employs rule-based and clustering-based classification to assess the sensitivity of a parameter to malicious behaviour, and further labels the API following the run-time parameters with varying degrees of sensitivities. Then, it encodes the APIs by concatenating the native embedding and the sensitive embedding of labelled APIs, for characterizing the relationship between successive labelled APIs and their correspondence in terms of security semantics. Finally, it feeds the sequences of API embedding into the deep neural network for training a binary classifier to detect malware. In addition to presenting the design, we have implemented CruParamer and evaluated it on two datasets. The results demonstrate that CruParamer outperforms naïve models when taking raw APIs as input, proving the effectiveness of CruParamer. Moreover, we have evaluated the impact of mimicry and adversarial attacks on our model, and the results verify the robustness of CruParamer.}

	abstract = {Acquiring the spatial distribution of users in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) brings many benefits to users ( e.g., avoiding crowded areas during the COVID-19 pandemic). Although the leakage of users’ location privacy has received a lot of research attention, existing works still ignore the rationality of users, resulting that users may not obtain satisfactory spatial distribution even if they provide true location information. To solve the problem, we employ game theory with incomplete information to model the interactions among users and seek an equilibrium state through learning approaches of the game. Specifically, we first model the service as a game in the satisfaction form and define the equilibrium for this service. Then, we design a LEFS algorithm for the privacy strategy learning of users when their satisfaction expectations are fixed, and further design LSRE that allows users to have dynamic satisfaction expectations. We theoretically analyze the convergence conditions and characteristics of the proposed algorithms, along with the privacy protection level obtained by our solution. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority and various performances of our proposal, which illustrates that our proposal can get more than 85% advantage in terms of the sensing distribution availability compared to the traditional spatial cloaking based solutions.}

	abstract = {Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image without leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence the detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and challenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is usually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation difficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy and a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism to localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is based on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages inter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high pass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery attention , is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic inconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal interdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among channels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise inconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to address the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial training strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust performance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial attacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our model on them. The proposed method is based on the assumption of content-changed manipulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in different benchmark datasets.}

Sadly, existing off-the-shelf composition policies often remain static, which creates potential security vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive password policy generation framework called HTPG. Based on the Zipf distribution of passwords, HTPG classifies all passwords in data set into two categories, that is, head passwords and tail passwords. We find that head passwords are vulnerable and high-value for attackers because they are most frequently used, while tail passwords have higher strength than head passwords. According to this fact, HTPG dynamically generates policies to enhance head passwords by modifying them so as to be closer to tail passwords on feature space. By introducing the idea of machine learning, we propose a policy sort method based on information gain ratio to help user choose more effective policies in enhancing head passwords. HTPG can effectively improve the security of entire password data set and make the password distribution more uniform. Experiments show that the number of cracked head passwords decreases 69% on average, compared with the original head passwords, by adopting policies generated by HTPG. Surveys on usability show that 80.23% enhanced passwords can be recalled by those who remember the corresponding original passwords.}

	abstract = {It is crucial to protect users’ location traces against inference attacks on aggregate mobility data collected from multiple users in various real-world applications. Most of the existing works on aggregate mobility data are focusing on inference attacks rather than designing privacy-preserving release mechanisms, and a few differential private release mechanisms suffer from poor utility-privacy tradeoffs. In this paper, we propose optimal centralized privacy-preserving aggregate mobility data release mechanisms (PAMDRMs) that minimize the leakage from an information-theoretic perspective by releasing perturbed versions of the raw aggregate location. Specifically, we use mutual information to measure user-level and aggregate-level privacy leakage separately, and formulate leakage minimization problems under utility constraints. As directly solving the optimization problems incur exponential complexity w.r.t. users’ trace length, we transform them into belief state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with a focus on the MDP formulation for the user-level privacy problem. We build reinforcement learning (RL) models and leverage the efficient Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic RL algorithm to derive the solutions to the MDPs as our optimal PAMDRMs. We compare them with two state-of-the-art privacy protection mechanisms PDPR (context-aware local design) and DMLM (context-free centralized design) in terms of mutual information leakage and adversary’s attack success (evaluated by her expected estimation error and Jensen-Shannon Divergence-based error). Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the user-level PAMDRM performs the best on both measures thanks to its context-aware property and centralized design. Even though the aggregate-level PAMDRM achieves better privacy-utility tradeoff than the other two, it does not always perform better than them on adversarial success, highlighting the necessity of considering privacy measures from different perspectives to avoid overestimating the level of privacy offered to users. Lastly, we discuss an alternative, fully data-driven approach to derive the optimal PAMDRM by leveraging adversarial training on limited data samples.}

	abstract = {Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential to secure face recognition systems and has been extensively studied in recent years. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) for the FAS task have achieved promising results in intra-dataset experiments with similar distributions of training and testing data, the DNNs’ generalization ability is limited under the cross-domain scenarios with different distributions of training and testing data. To improve the generalization ability, recent hybrid methods have been explored to extract task-aware handcrafted features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern) as discriminative information for the input of DNNs. However, the handcrafted feature extraction relies on experts’ domain knowledge, and how to choose appropriate handcrafted features is underexplored. To this end, we propose a learnable network to extract Meta Pattern (MP) in our learning-to-learn framework. By replacing handcrafted features with the MP, the discriminative information from MP is capable of learning a more generalized model. Moreover, we devise a two-stream network to hierarchically fuse the input RGB image and the extracted MP by using our proposed Hierarchical Fusion Module (HFM). We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that our MP outperforms the compared handcrafted features. Also, our proposed method with HFM and the MP can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two different domain generalization evaluation benchmarks.}

In a large open-world setting with 400,000 websites, snWF manages to determine whether a user is visiting a monitored website, with a true positive rate of 98.1% and a false positive rate of 5.7%. We also evaluated snWF in a more realistic attack scenario, termed as wide-world , to examine whether snWF can correctly classify websites that even an adversary has not seen before, and we found that snWF achieves a higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art attacks in this new setting. In addition, in the face of concept drift, snWF is found to be more resilient than any other attacks. Moreover, we are the first to reveal that under concept drift WF attacks suffer more severe performance degradation in a open-world setting than in a closed-world setting.}

	abstract = {Immutability has been widely accepted as a fundamental property protecting the security of blockchain technology. However, this property impedes the development of blockchain because of the abuse of blockchain storage and legal obligations. To mitigate this issue, a novel construction of blockchain, called redactable blockchain , was introduced. It enables a central authority to issue the rewriting privilege to a particular party who can rewrite a registered object, e.g., a block or a transaction, in a controlled way. Unfortunately, the central authority must be fully trusted and is an obvious target suffering from various attacks. In this paper, we introduce a redactable blockchain controlled at a fine-grained level in a decentralized setting. In our solution, the rewriting privilege is issued by multiple authorities for reducing the vulnerability of the centralized setting. To formalize our solution, we introduce a novel cryptographic notion, called decentralized policy-based chameleon hash (DPCH), with the formal definition and security model. By applying several simple cryptographic tools, such as chameleon hash, digital signature, and multi-authority attribute-based encryption, we present the generic construction of DPCH along with rigorous security proofs. By applying RSA-based chameleon hash and BLS short signature, we give a practical instantiation of DPCH with performance evaluation. The comprehensive evaluation shows that our solution has superior performance than the state-of-the-art solution.}

	abstract = {Currently, fingerprint authentication systems in mobile devices, which have limited-size fingerprint sensors, are mainly based on partial fingerprint matching algorithms. To cover all areas of the finger, the system usually collects multiple partially overlapping partial fingerprints during the enrollment. Existing recognition methods either perform score-level fusion after single-to-single matching, or perform single-to-single matching after image-level mosaicking. However, these two-stage methods have the risk of discarding some real information or introducing some fake information. In this paper, we define this “query2set” task and propose a novel single-to-multiple partial fingerprint recognition method based on atttention mechanism. Our end-to-end deep model can adaptively extract and fuse appropriate features from a set of fingerprints for matching based on the input query fingerprint. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art single-to-single approaches and provides a new insight of fingerprint recognition on mobile devices.}

	abstract = {Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is essential for securing face recognition systems. Despite the decent performance, few existing works fully leverage temporal information. This would inevitably lead to inferior performance because real and fake faces tend to share highly similar spatial appearances, while important temporal features between consecutive frames are neglected. In this work, we propose a temporal transformer network (TTN) to learn multi-granularity temporal characteristics for FAS. It mainly consists of temporal difference attentions (TDA), a pyramid temporal aggregation (PTA), and a temporal depth difference loss (TDL). Firstly, the vision transformer (ViT) is used as the backbone where comprehensive local patches are utilized to provide subtle differences between live and spoof faces. Then, instead of learning temporal features on global faces which may miss some important local cues, the TDA is developed to extract motion-sensitive cues on each of the comprehensive local patches. Moreover, the TDA is inserted into different layers of the ViT, learning multi-scale motion-sensitive local cues to improve the FAS performance. Secondly, it is observed that different subjects may have different visual tempos in some actions, making it necessary to model different temporal speeds. Our PTA aggregates temporal features at various tempos, which could build short-range and long-range relations among multiple frames. Thirdly, depth maps for real parts may change continuously, while they remain zeros for spoof regions. In order to locate motion features on facial parts, the TDL is proposed to guide the network to locate spoof facial parts where motion patterns between neighboring frames are set as the ground truth. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to learn temporal characteristics via transformers. Both qualitative and quantitative results on several challenging tasks demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposed methods.}

It is the first attempt to design an observed-based FDF for wind power system considering actuator fault signal. And a tolerable actuator fault threshold function is constructed to warn the occurrence of fault signal. Then, considering the bandwidth limitation of network communication, a novel dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed to decrease the occupation of communication channel. Furthermore, the DAA DoS attacks presented in this work have different blocking effects on data transmission in different network channel. On account of the existence of aperiodic DoS attacks, the general load frequency control model for wind power system is reconstructed as a new switched system. Based on the reconstructed model, the stability with an\nH\n∞\nperformance index is demonstrated by constructing appropriate polynomial Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Besides, the FDF and dynamic event-triggered controller can be achieved by solving linear matrix inequalities. Finally, some contradistinctive case studies are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approaches proposed in this article.}

	abstract = {For small, inexpensive, and power-constrained IoT devices, Radiofrequency fingerprinting (RF-fingerprinting) has emerged as a cost-effective security solution. Robustness and permanence of the RF-fingerprints (RFFs) are major challenges since this solution’s inception. This is due to domain-related complications such as environmental effects and time-varying device-related perturbations. Since data from domains have divergent distributions, blindly plugging in Machine learning algorithms can overfit domain-related residuals rather than the fingerprint. Recent popular methods like blind channel equalization-based solutions only partially solve this problem while adversely affecting the RFF’s user capacity. Our paper presents a solution to overcome the domain generalization of these computationally intensive feature mining methods in a real-world wireless domain while retaining the fingerprints’ richness. We perform a reverse analysis of a typical RFIC and create a parametric RF-impairment distribution model currently missing in the literature. Then, we use this model to tailor a knowledge-based parametric signal processing and conditioning method, which would create an optimum signal representation of the RFF for ML algorithms. Additionally, our method can significantly reduce the dimensionality of the data needed to train the ML algorithms, eliminate noise, and simplify the classifier needed for RF-fingerprinting. We present our results after evaluation using real-world cross-domain experiments under varying domain conditions with COTS IoT microchips (SX1276).}

This can lead to significant secrecy gains. This work exploits these gains via a tractable joint design of downlink beamformers and IRS phase-shifts. In this respect, we consider a generic IRS-aided MIMO wiretap setting and invoke fractional programming and alternating optimization to iteratively find the beamformers and phase-shifts that maximize the achievable weighted secrecy sum-rate. Our design is comprised of two low-complexity algorithms. Performance of the proposed algorithms are numerically evaluated and compared to the benchmark. The results reveal that integrating IRSs into MIMO systems not only boosts the secrecy performance, but also improves the robustness against passive eavesdropping.}

	abstract = {Most pictures shared online are accompanied by temporal metadata (i.e., the day and time they were taken), which makes it possible to associate an image content with real-world events. Maliciously manipulating this metadata can convey a distorted version of reality. In this work, we present the emerging problem of detecting timestamp manipulation. We propose an end-to-end approach to verify whether the purported time of capture of an outdoor image is consistent with its content and geographic location. We consider manipulations done in the hour and/or month of capture of a photograph. The central idea is the use of supervised consistency verification, in which we predict the probability that the image content, capture time, and geographical location are consistent. We also include a pair of auxiliary tasks, which can be used to explain the network decision. Our approach improves upon previous work on a large benchmark dataset, increasing the classification accuracy from 59.0% to 81.1%. We perform an ablation study that highlights the importance of various components of the method, showing what types of tampering are detectable using our approach. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed method can be employed to estimate a possible time-of-capture in scenarios in which the timestamp is missing from the metadata.}

While those approaches have been successful, they rely on intuitive principles and ad-hoc costs associated with each pixel or Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficient. Beyond the empirical assessments, the insights one can get from such approaches are very limited. On the opposite, this paper presents an original method for steganography in JPEG images that exploits a statistical model of the DCT coefficients. Within the framework of hypothesis testing theory, we use a statistical model of covers to derive the analytical expression of the most powerful detector. The objective of the steganographer is to minimize the statistical performance of this “omniscient detector” which represents a “worst-case” scenario for security. This paper shows how this method allows designing effective steganography, in terms of both security and computational complexity, in the two main use cases: when having only one single JPEG image and when the uncompressed image is available, case also known as Side-Informed (SI). A wide range of numerical comparisons shows that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art especially against the latest and most accurate steganalysis approaches based on Deep Learning.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) aims to match faces across different domains ( e.g. , visible to near-infrared images), which has been widely applied in authentication and forensics scenarios. However, HFR is a challenging problem because of the large cross-domain discrepancy, limited heterogeneous data pairs, and large variation of facial attributes. To address these challenges, we propose a new HFR method from the perspective of heterogeneous data augmentation, named Face Synthesis with Identity-Attribute Disentanglement (FSIAD). Firstly, the identity-attribute disentanglement (IAD) decouples face images into identity-related representations and identity-unrelated representations (called attributes), and then decreases the correlation between identities and attributes. Secondly, we devise a face synthesis module (FSM) to generate a large number of images with stochastic combinations of disentangled identities and attributes for enriching the attribute diversity of synthetic images. Both the original images and the synthetic ones are utilized to train the HFR network for tackling the challenges and improving the performance of HFR. Extensive experiments on five HFR databases validate that FSIAD obtains superior performance than previous HFR approaches. Particularly, FSIAD obtains 4.8% improvement over state of the art in terms of VR@FAR=0.01% on LAMP-HQ, the largest HFR database so far.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage is more and more prevalent in practice, and thus how to check its integrity becomes increasingly essential. A classical solution is identity-based (ID-based) provable data possession (PDP), which supports certificateless cloud storage auditing without entire user data. However, existing ID-PDP protocols always require that cloud users outsource data blocks, authenticators and a small-sized file tag to the cloud, and make use of the heavy elliptic curve cryptography over bilinear pairing. These disadvantages would result in vast storage, communication, and computation costs, which is unexpected, especially for resource-limited cloud users. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel cryptographic primitive: ID-based PDP with compressed cloud storage. In this model, cloud storage auditing can be achieved by using only encrypted data blocks in a self-verified way, and original data blocks can be reconstructed from the outsourced data. Thus, data owners no longer need to store original data blocks on the cloud. We also use some basic algebraic operations to realize a concrete ID-based PDP protocol with compressed cloud storage, which is quite efficient due to no heavy cryptographic operations involved. The proposed protocol can easily be extended to support the other practical functions by using the primitive replacement technique. The proposed protocol is strictly proven to have the properties of correctness, privacy, unforgeability and detectability. Finally, we give plenty of theoretical analysis and experimental results to validate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.}

In this paper, we study the risk that model compression could provide an opportunity for adversaries to inject stealthy backdoors. In a backdoor attack on a machine learning model, an adversary produces a model that performs well on normal inputs but outputs targeted misclassifications on inputs containing a small trigger pattern. We design stealthy backdoor attacks such that the full-sized model released by adversaries appears to be free from backdoors (even when tested using state-of-the-art techniques), but when the model is compressed it exhibits a highly effective backdoor. We show this can be done for two common model compression techniques—model pruning and model quantization—even in settings where the adversary has limited knowledge of how the particular compression will be done. Our findings demonstrate the importance of performing security tests on the models that will actually be deployed not in their precompressed version.

	abstract = {In-vehicle communications are not designed for message exchange between the vehicles and outside systems originally. Thus, the security design of message protection is insufficient. Moreover, the internal devices do not have enough resources to process the additional security operations. Nonetheless, due to the characteristic of the in-vehicle network in which messages are broadcast, secure message transmission to specific receivers must be ensured. With consideration of the facts aforementioned, this work addresses resource problems by offloading secure operations to high-performance devices, and uses attribute-based access control to ensure the confidentiality of messages from attackers and unauthorized users. In addition, we reconfigure existing access control based cryptography to address new vulnerabilities arising from the use of edge computing and attribute-based access control. Thus, this paper proposes an edge computing-based security protocol with fine-grained attribute-based encryption using a hash function, symmetric-based cryptography, and reconfigured cryptographic scheme. In addition, this work formally proves the reconfigured cryptographic scheme and security protocol, and evaluates the feasibility of the proposed security protocol in various aspects using the CANoe software.}

	abstract = {With the wide use of smartphones, more private data are collected and saved in the smartphones. This raises higher requirements for secure and effective user authentication scheme. Continuous authentication leverages behavioral biometrics as identity information and shows promising characteristics for user verification in a continuous and passive means. However, most studies require users to operate the smartphones in a specific mobile application or perform user-defined touch operations. This paper studies the continuous authentication on smartphones in the wild, where it is hard to characterize touching behavior accurately due to the complexity of usage context and cross-use of various types of touch gestures. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a continuous authentication framework using multiple modalities, named as MMAuth, which integrates the heterogeneous information of user identity from multiple modalities (e.g., motion movement pattern, touch dynamics, usage context). A time-extended behavioral feature set (TEB) and a deep learning based one-class classifier (DeSVDD) are developed for performing more accurate authentication. Evaluations are conducted using a novel unconstrained smartphone usage dataset collected from 100 volunteers in real world as well as a public laboratory dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art authentication performance of MMAuth in both unconstrained and laboratory environment, and the effectiveness of its two proposed modules (the TEB feature set and the DeSVDD classifier). Additional experiments on system robustness, in terms of usability to different touch gestures, sensitivity to various mobile applications, and scalability to user space, are also provided to examine the applicability of MMAuth.}

	abstract = {In recent decades, a large number of perceptual image hashing schemes have been designed to secure the authenticity and integrity of digital images. However, the feasible criterion to evaluate the performances of hashing schemes has not been developed yet. To this end, a unified performance evaluation method for perceptual image hashing schemes is proposed in this paper. The proposed evaluation method contains six modules: robustness, discrimination, tampering detection, security, computational efficiency and hash length. The order relationship analysis (ORA) is employed to assign the score proportion of each module in accordance with the relative importance of performance, which allows the customizability of user. The real scores of modules and the outputted final score can reflect the performances of perceptual image hashing schemes intuitively and convincingly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method is practical and effective for the complete and comprehensive evaluation of perceptual image hashing schemes.}

	abstract = {Image licensing regulates the scope, type, and limitations of using an image through an agreement. However, it is challenging to verify whether an agreement has been fulfilled honestly. Existing techniques, such as watermarking and perceptual hashing, help check image originality and editing operations specified in the agreement, but fail to achieve editor designation. In this paper, we propose a verifiable image licensing system (VILS) which provides an effective solution to verify if a received image is used legally according to its licensing agreement. The core building block of our design is a new kind of cryptographic primitive, called accumulator with a designated entity. The new accumulator helps achieve not only editing restriction, but also editor designation in image authentication. Our VILS has the following two appealing features: (1) Authorization: Only an authorized licensee who edits an image with operations declared in a licensing agreement can produce valid images; (2) Efficiency: The verification of VILS is efficient and independent of the number of operations or image size. Compared with the most relevant schemes from the state-of-the-art, the new design enriches the functionality of image authentication but reduces the verification time by 40%.}

	abstract = {Near-InfraRed and VISual (NIR-VIS) face matching, as one of the most representative tasks in Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), aims at retrieving a face image across different domains. With the development of deep learning and the growing demand for intelligent surveillance, it has aroused more and more research attention in the computer vision community. However, due to the dramatic modality gap between NIR and VIS images, the task of NIR-VIS face recognition becomes practically very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain-private Factor Detachment (DFD) network to disentangle domain-dependent factors and achieve identity information distillation. Our approach consists of three key components, including Domain-identity Representation Learning (DiRL), Cross-domain Factor Detachment (CdFD) and Cross-domain Aggregation Learning (CAL). Firstly, the proposed DiRL aims to achieve domain-specific information distillation and learn identity-related representations. Specifically, three sub-networks, i.e., NIR sub-Network (NIR-Net), VIS sub-Network (VIS-Net) and IDentity-dependent sub-Network (ID-Net) are designed to learn NIR facial representations, VIS facial representations and identity-dependent representations, respectively, and they can promote each other to facilitate the learning of identity-discriminative representations. Secondly, considering that the entangled modal components in face representations negatively affect the subsequent matching process, to reduce modality-related components, we model the cross-modal face matching problem into three parts, comprising Identity Variation (IV), Inter-Spectrum Variation (ISV) and Identity-Domain Variation (IDV). The CdFD is presented to eliminate ISV components and IDV components by introducing inter-spectrum invariant constraint and identity-domain invariant constraint, so that cross-modal face recognition can be performed under pure identity information differences without modal interference. Finally, the CAL is developed to learn modality-invariant yet discriminative representations by exploring within-class aggregation, negative pair separability and cross-domain positive pair compactness. Experimental results on multiple challenging databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the DFD approach.}

	abstract = {Machine learning models are vulnerable to data inference attacks, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks. In these types of breaches, an adversary attempts to infer a data record’s membership in a dataset or even reconstruct this data record using a confidence score vector predicted by the target model. However, most existing defense methods only protect against membership inference attacks. Methods that can combat both types of attacks require a new model to be trained, which may not be time-efficient. In this paper, we propose a differentially private defense method that handles both types of attacks in a time-efficient manner by tuning only one parameter, the privacy budget. The central idea is to modify and normalize the confidence score vectors with a differential privacy mechanism which preserves privacy and obscures membership and reconstructed data. Moreover, this method can guarantee the order of scores in the vector to avoid any loss in classification accuracy. The experimental results show the method to be an effective and timely defense against both membership inference and model inversion attacks with no reduction in accuracy.}

We consider the scenario that a pair of primary users and two pairs of secondary users (SUs) exchange information via a MIMO two-way relay, where the edge SU of each SU pair is untrusted and tries to wiretap the central SU’s information. For ensuring security, we aim to maximize the sum achievable secrecy rate (SASR) by jointly optimizing the power allocation at all users, power splitting factor and relay beamforming subject to the quality of service (QoS), energy harvesting and transmit power constraints. The formulated optimization problem is highly nonconvex due to coupling variables, thus it is challenging to solve. An effective path-following (PF)-based algorithm is proposed, which is proven to converge to a stationary point. Theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed PF-based algorithm has lower complexity than the state-of-art algorithm. To further reduce complexity, we proposed a zero-forcing (ZF)-based scheme. Numerical simulations show that the proposed PF-based algorithm achieves the same SASR as the state-of-art algorithm with moderate complexity, while the proposed ZF-based scheme strikes a good balance between performance and complexity.}

We use the Furthest Point First algorithm to perform phishing prototype extractions, in order to select instances that are representative of a cluster of phishing webpages. We also introduce the use of an incremental learning algorithm as a framework for continuous and adaptive detection without extracting new features when concept drift occurs. On a large dataset, our proposed method significantly outperforms previous methods in detecting phishing websites, with an AUC score of 98.68%, a high true positive rate (TPR) of around 90%, while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.58%. Our approach uses prototypes, eliminating the need to retain long term data in the future, and is feasible to deploy in real systems with a processing time of roughly 0.3 seconds.}

	abstract = {Biphasic facial age translation aims at predicting the appearance of the input face at any age. Facial age translation has received considerable research attention in the last decade due to its practical value in cross-age face recognition and various entertainment applications. However, most existing methods model age changes between holistic images, regardless of the human face structure and the age-changing patterns of individual facial components. Consequently, the lack of semantic supervision will cause infidelity of generated faces in detail. To this end, we propose a unified framework for biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative adversarial networks. Structurally, we project the class-aware noisy semantic layouts to “soft” latent maps for the following injection operation on the individual facial parts. In particular, we introduce two sub-networks, ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet. ProjectionNet introduces the low-level structural semantic information with noise map and produces “soft” latent maps. ConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the “soft” latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the “soft” latent maps. Specifically, attention mechanism is employed in ConstraintNet for feature disentanglement. Meanwhile, in order to mine the strongest mapping ability of the network, we embed two types of learning strategies in the training procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. As a result, extensive experiments conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets demonstrate the prominent ability of our proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has emerged as a promising means for supporting high-rate covert communication. However, the use of antenna arrays with beamforming at mmWave requires precise beam alignment between legitimate parties, and this procedure may entail large beam training overhead and create additional signal leakage to eavesdroppers. In this work, we consider a multi-user mmWave communication system and address the problem of designing proper covert beam training and data transmission between legitimate parties Alice and Bobs, while keeping the underlying communication undetectable from warden Willie. We first propose a novel Covert Multi-user Beam Training Strategy (CMBTS) that adopts multi-finger beam codebook to reduce the probability of communication being detected and to enable simultaneous training for multiple users. With the proposed CMBTS, a joint optimization framework for covert beam training and data transmission with a friendly jammer is developed to maximize the effective covert throughput while ensuring the covertness constraint at warden is met. We further propose an algorithm that combines successive convex approximation and inexact block coordinate descent methods to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the CMBTS proposed and confirm its superior performance as compared to several beam training baselines (including exhaustive and hierarchical search) tailored to the covert communication setup considered. Among them, CMBTS achieves the best successful alignment probability and the largest effective covert throughput yet with the least training overhead.}

	abstract = {Existing heterogeneous face synthesis (HFS) methods focus on performing accurate image-to-image translation across domains, while they cannot effectively remove the nuisance facial variations such as poses, expressions or occlusions. To address such challenges, this paper studies a new practical heterogeneous prototype learning (HPL) problem. To be specific, given a face image contaminated by facial variations from a source domain, HPL aims to reconstruct the variation-free prototype in a specified target domain. To tackle HPL, we propose a unified and end-to-end framework named bidirectional heterogeneous prototype learning (BHPL). As a bidirectional learning framework, BHPL is able to simultaneously reconstruct the heterogeneous prototypes across source-to-target as well as target-to-source domains. Furthermore, BHPL is capable of learning the identity prototype features for the contaminated face images from both source and target domains in order to perform robust heterogeneous face recognition. BHPL consists of an encoder-decoder structural generator and two dual-task discriminators, which play an adversarial game such that the generator learns the identity prototype feature and generates the cross-domain identity-preserved prototype for each input face image from both domains, and the discriminators accurately predict face identity and distinguish real versus fake prototypes. Empirically studies on multiple heterogeneous face datasets containing facial variations demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPL.}

A number of solutions employed trusted hardware to protect MapReduce tasks. However, existing works pointed out that simply protecting individual nodes in the MapReduce cluster with trusted hardware and protecting cross-node communication with encryption still leak information from side-channels. Specifically, attackers can derive data information by observing and manipulating cross-node communication traffic volumes. Although existing works proposed some solutions to prevent such leakage, in this paper, we show that previous solutions still leak critical job information. Additionally, our study shows that previous solutions have limitations from other aspects, including data restriction, partition function restriction, reliability issue, and high overheads. To address all the discovered limitations, we introduced the Strong Shuffle solution. Our analysis and experimental results showed that our solution has reduced the information leakage and addressed other discovered limitations. To support Strong Shuffle, we proposed a variant Bloom Filter, named Group-based Dynamic Bloom Filter (GDBF). Our theoretical analysis showed that GDBF has lower performance and storage overhead than the traditional Scalable Bloom Filter.}

This paper generalizes and improves the VES scheme of Yang et al. , such that it covers a family of signatures with similar structures, including ECDSA, Schnorr and their variants. Our construction is very efficient: comparing with Yang et al. ’s construction, the size of the resulting VES (for ECDSA) is reduced by more than 25 times. The only caveat is that the adjudicator is required to store a look-up table of size around 270MB.

For the multi-user wiretap channels, very recently, it has been shown that Ozarow’s capacity-achieving feedback scheme for the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC) is the SSCA feedback scheme for the two-user Gaussian multiple-access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT). In this paper, first, we propose a SSCA feedback scheme for the two-user GMAC-WT with degraded message sets (GMAC-WT-DMS). Next, we extend the above scheme to the two-user GMAC-WT-DMS with noncausal channel state information at the transmitters (NCSIT), and show that the extended scheme is also a SSCA feedback scheme. Finally, we derive outer bounds on the secrecy capacity regions of the two-user GMAC-WT-DMS with or without NCSIT, and numerical results show the rate gains by the feedback.}

	abstract = {Encrypted retrieval ensures the secure retrieval over the encrypted data without sacrificing the confidentiality. Its applications in the database systems have brought this primitive under the spotlight. Once the malicious sender sends the wrong message, conventional encrypted retrieval is arduous to provide message-moderation and even abuse reporting arises when any receiver is allowed to fabricate and convince a malicious message. We introduce the idea of searchable message-moderation, a newly exquisite framework named CleanSE that enables the system to simultaneously provide encrypted retrieval and fallacious reporting resistance. In a nutshell, CleanSE is achieved via a securely technical combination of asymmetric message franking and searchable encryption. We design two CleanSE schemes. The first, called Recon , leverages designated verifier signatures to generate a report proof such as to prevent fallacious report and undeniability, and assists with designated-server searchable encryption to protect confidentiality and privacy. Our improved scheme is called Reclean . Compared with Recon , Reclean adds an additional algorithm,\nClean\n, to filter forged message and employs asymmetric message franking to provide stronger deniability and accountability. We implement and evaluate prototype of our CleanSE system to highlight its feasibility and practicality.}

	abstract = {Opportunistic Underwater Sensor Networks (OUSNs) are deployed for various underwater applications, such as underwater creature tracking and tactical surveillance. In an OUSN invaded by some eavesdroppers, the data messages disseminated by sensor nodes are probably stolen (captured and cracked) by the eavesdroppers. The data messages are disseminated through acoustic waves which could be altered by the environmental noises, i.e., the acoustic waves containing data messages could be superimposed by the environmental noises. To protect the data messages from being stolen by eavesdroppers and guarantee the required delivery ratio of data messages, we propose a Noise-based-protection Message Dissemination Method (NMDM). In NMDM, the acoustic waves containing data messages are superposed by the environmental noises and converted into some pseudo data messages. The environmental noises around source nodes are identified, encoded, and encrypted into some noise messages. Then, the pseudo data messages and noise messages are individually disseminated to the sink node. Such mechanism makes the eavesdroppers difficult to steal the data messages. Besides, the required delivery ratio of data messages is achieved by measuring the similarities between the nodes and the sink node, i.e., the pseudo data messages and noise messages are preferentially disseminated to the nodes with larger similarities to the sink node. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of NMDM. NMDM can reduce the theft ratio of data messages and guarantee the required delivery ratio of data messages effectively.}

	abstract = {Code-based masking is a recent line of research on masking schemes aiming at provably counteracting side-channel attacks. It generalizes and unifies many masking schemes within a coding-theoretic formalization. In code-based masking schemes, the tuning parameters are the underlying linear codes, whose choice significantly affects the side-channel resilience. In this paper, we investigate the exploitability of the information leakage in code-based masking and present attack-based evaluation results of higher-order optimal distinguisher (HOOD). Particularly, we consider two representative instances of code-based masking, namely inner product masking (IPM) and Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) based masking. Our results do confirm the state-of-the-art theoretical derivatives in an empirical manner with numerically simulated measurements. Specifically, theoretical results are based on quantifying information leakage; we further complete the panorama with attack-based evaluations by investigating the exploitability of the leakage. Moreover, we classify all possible candidates of linear codes in IPM with 2 and 3 shares and (3, 1)-SSS based masking, and highlight both optimal and worst codes for them. Relying on our empirical evaluations, we therefore recommend investigating the coding-theoretic properties to find the best linear codes in strengthening instances of code-based masking. As for applications, our attack-based evaluation directly empowers designers, by employing optimal linear codes, to enhance the protection of code-based masking. Our framework leverages simulated leakage traces, hence allowing for source code validation or patching in case it is found to be attackable.}

	abstract = {Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is an emerging secure distributed learning paradigm that aggregates user-trained local gradients into a federated model through a cryptographic protocol. Unfortunately, PPFL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in PPFL, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as ShieldFL), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in PPFL. Specially, we first present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution (IID) and non-IID data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets ( i.e., MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) show that ShieldFL outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, ShieldFL can achieve 30%-80% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-IID and IID settings.}

	abstract = {To implement image storage and computation in cloud servers without violating users’ privacy, privacy-preserving feature extraction has been a new research interest. The existing works are mainly designed for grayscale images. For color images, they tend to convert them to grayscale images or obtain the results of the combination of single-channel processes. While the capabilities of features extracted from the encrypted color images will be affected if color information and inter-relationship between color channels are ignored. To fully preserve features of color images, we introduce quaternion theory to encode each color image and propose an improved vector homomorphic encryption scheme (IVHE) to encrypt quaternion-based color images. IVHE helps protect image content and keep vector characteristics of color images. Based on IVHE, the framework for feature extraction of privacy-preserving Quaternion Discrete Orthogonal Moments (PPQDOMs) is presented. Theoretical analyses prove that Quaternion Discrete Orthogonal Moments (QDOMs) can be extracted from the encrypted color images by PPQDOMs. Furthermore, we apply three common Discrete Orthogonal Moments to the proposed framework to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can protect color image content and perform well compared to QDOMs in image reconstruction and image recognition.}

	abstract = {The potential vulnerability to wireless spoofing attacks is still a critical concern for Next Generation Internet of Things (NGIoT) networks which may result in catastrophic consequences in mission–critical applications. Conventional solutions may impose additional signal processing, protocol, and latency overheads which are inappropriate for NGIoT networks designed to provide high–speed and low–latency connections for a large number of resource–constrained IoT devices. In this paper, we utilize the uniqueness of beam pattern features in mmWave–enabled devices and propose a scalable security mechanism for the detection of wireless spoofing attacks in NGIoT networks. This uniqueness is proven to exist due to the non–ideal manufacturing of antenna arrays used in mmWave–enabled devices. In our approach, when legitimate mmWave–enabled IoT devices enrol into the network, their unique beam features are learned by a learning model developed at the network server. Then, during data transmission, network base stations (gNBs)/Access Points (APs) measure the beam features from the received RF signals and send them to the network server for the detection of anomalies. We develop our learning model based on Deep Autoencoders (DAEs) that are an effective tool for anomaly detection. Fortunately, the beam feature extraction can be performed using the beam searching mechanism that is already provided in mmWave standards (5G–NR and IEEE 802.11ad). Thus, feature extraction does not introduce any signal processing overheads to the system. Moreover, the proposed mechanism imposes zero computation/communication overhead to the resource—constrained IoT nodes. In our experiments, we reached 98.6% accuracy in the detection of illegitimate devices which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

The proposed approach exploits the analogy between the intrinsic correlation of two or more particles and the dependence of each HTTP request on the preceding ones. Starting from the a-posteriori probability of each request to belong to a particular class, it is possible to assign a Qubit state representing a combination of the aforementioned probabilities for all available observations of the time series. By leveraging the underlying mathematical details of superposition and entanglement on specific subsequences, it is possible to devise a measure of membership to each class, thus enabling the system to take a reliable decision when a sufficient level of confidence is met or to continue with additional observations. The results reported in this paper objectively show the effectiveness of our quantum-inspired algorithm which outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, including our own one based on the Sequential Probability Ratio Test.}

	abstract = {Streaming music has dominated the digital music industry in recent years, which allows users to enjoy a huge music library online with a low subscription price. Terminal-side audio DRM (Digital Right Management) is very critical for streaming music industry, compromising of which will cause unrestricted listening, dumping and unauthorized secondary distribution. However, existing DRM protection schemes mainly focus on defeating software attacks but lack complete shielding against the physical memory disclosure attacks, which may even be launched by the owner of the terminal device. In this paper, we propose a terminal-side audio DRM solution called TrustSAMP to protect the copyrighted audio data against both software attacks and physical memory disclosure attacks. The basic idea is to process the audio data plaintext only in certain on-SoC components secured by ARM TrustZone. To minimize the TCB (Trusted Computing Base) of the secure world, we separate the control flow and the data flow of the Linux audio subsystem and port only the codes used for audio data decryption and plaintext transfer into the secure world. Moreover, we leave most driver codes of the audio-associated on-SoC components in the rich OS (i.e., in the normal world), and introduce a tiny proxy in the secure world to control the associated registers according to the requests from the normal-world drivers. The prototype implemented on real hardware shows that TrustSAMP can play a variety of wav-format audio with very small overhead and negligible loss of audio quality.}

In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study on how adversaries leverage URL redirection to circumvent security checks and distribute malicious content in practice. To this end, we design an iteratively running framework to mine the domains used for malicious redirections constantly. First, we use a bipartite graph-based method to dig out the domains potentially involved in malicious redirections from real-world DNS traffic. Then, we dynamically crawl these suspicious domains and recover the corresponding redirection chains from the crawler’s performance log. Based on the collected redirection chains, we analyze the working mechanism of various malicious redirections, involving the abused modes and methods, and highlight the pervasiveness of node sharing. Notably, we find a new redirection abuse, redirection fluxing, which is abused to enhance the concealment of malicious sites by introducing randomness into the redirection. Our case studies reveal the adversary’s preference for abusing JavaScript methods to conduct redirection, even by introducing time-delay and fabricating user clicks to simulate normal users.}

Generally speaking, detecting manipulated faces and locating the potentially altered regions are challenging tasks. Herein, we propose a conceptually simple but effective method to efficiently detect forged faces in an image while simultaneously locating the manipulated regions. The proposed scheme relies on a segmentation map that delivers meaningful high-level semantic information clues about the image. Furthermore, a noise map is estimated, playing a complementary role in capturing low-level clues and subsequently empowering decision-making. Finally, the features from these two modules are combined to distinguish fake faces.

The paper includes both an analysis of the test as well as its empirical evaluation. The analysis provides an expression for the approximate lower bound of the detection probability, and the empirical evaluation shows this approximation to be similar to the actual detection probability. Since the LO-GLRT requires the score function of the input distribution, which is usually unknown in practice, we study the LO-GLRT for a learned surrogate input distribution. Specifically, we use a Gaussian distribution over the input subvectors as the surrogate distribution, for its mathematical tractability and computational efficiency. We evaluate the detector for several popular image classifiers and datasets, and compare the statistical and computational performance with the perturbation rectifying network (PRN) detector, another successful approach for detecting the UAPs. The LO-GLRT outperforms the PRN detector on both counts, with a running time at least 100 times lower than that of the PRN detector.}

	abstract = {Secure cloud search service allows resource-constrained clients to effectively search over encrypted cloud storage. Towards enabling owner-enforced search authorization, the notion of attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) has been introduced and widely deployed in practice. To enhance traditional security of ABKS, two state-of-the-art solutions are presented to address keyword guessing attacks or setup inconsistency for secret key. Nevertheless, they have not simultaneously considered the following threats to a data user: (i) inconsistent secret key/cipher-index caused by outside dishonest authority and/or data owner; (ii) algorithm substitution attacks (ASA) launched by inside adversarial eavesdropping. These attacks may unfortunately lead to cloud data breach and user information exposure. To tackle such outside and inside threats, we introduce subversion-resistance and consistency for secure and fine-grained cloud document search services. In particular, we propose a consistent ABKS system with cryptographic reverse firewalls (CRF). Technically, we refer to verifiable functional encryption and employ non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of discrete logarithm equality to ensure strong input consistency for ABKS. In addition, we build a trusted CRF zone for sanitizing algorithm outputs against ASA attacks. Moreover, we formalize the security model and formally prove security of our system. To clarify practical performance, we implement state-of-the-art solutions and our system in real cloud environment based on Enron dataset. The results show that our system achieves more enhanced security properties without obviously sacrificing performance. In particular, our system achieves comparable time and storage cost for document-index encryption and document search, as compared to state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a popular standard for privacy-preserving data collection. Numerous LDP protocols have been proposed in the literature which differ in how they provide higher utility in different settings. Yet, few have engaged in analyzing the privacy relationships of these protocols under varying settings, and consequently, it is non-trivial to select which LDP protocol is best to use in a newly emerging application. In this paper, we present an adversarial approach to protocol analysis and selection and make three original contributions. First, we introduce a Bayesian adversary to analyze the privacy relationships of LDP protocols under varying settings. We show that different protocols have substantially different responses to the attack effectiveness of the Bayesian adversary, measured in terms of Adversarial Success Rate (ASR). Second, we provide a formal and empirical analysis on a set of privacy and utility-critical factors, including encoding parameters, privacy budget, data domain, adversarial knowledge, and statistical distribution. We show that different settings of these factors have significant effects on the ASRs of LDP protocols, and no protocol provides consistently low ASR across all settings. Third, we design and develop LDPLens, a prototype implementation of our proposed framework. Given a data collection scenario with various factors and constraints, LDPLens enables optimized selection of a desirable LDP protocol for the given scenario. We evaluate the effectiveness of LDPLens using three case studies with real-world datasets. Results show that LDPLens recommends a different protocol in each case study, and the protocol recommended by LDPLens can yield up to 1.5–2 fold reduction in utility loss, ASR or privacy budget compared to a randomly selected protocol.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of private polynomial computation (PPC) from a distributed storage system (DSS). In such setting a user wishes to compute a multivariate polynomial of degree at most\ng\nover\nf\nvariables (or messages) stored in\nn\nnoncolluding coded databases, i.e., databases storing data encoded with an\n[n,k]\nlinear storage code, while revealing no information about the desired polynomial evaluation to the databases. For a DSS setup where data is stored using linear storage codes, we derive an outer bound on the PPC rate, which is defined as the ratio of the (minimum) desired amount of information and the total amount of downloaded information, and construct two novel PPC schemes. In the first scheme, we consider Reed-Solomon coded databases with Lagrange encoding, which leverages ideas from recently proposed star-product private information retrieval and Lagrange coded computation. The second scheme considers the special case of coded databases with systematic Lagrange encoding. Both schemes yield improved rates, while asymptotically, as\nf→∞\n, the systematic scheme gives a significantly better computation retrieval rate compared to all known schemes up to some storage code rate that depends on the maximum degree of the candidate polynomials.}

	abstract = {Many machine learning tasks such as structured sparse coding and multi-task learning can be converted into an equality constrained optimization problem. The stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) is a popular algorithm to solve such large-scale problems, and has been successfully used in many real-world applications. However, existing SADMMs fail to take into consideration an important issue in their designs, i.e., protecting sensitive information. To address this challenging issue, this paper proposes a novel differential privacy stochastic ADMM framework for solving equality constrained machine learning problems. In particular, to further lift the utility in privacy-preserving equality constrained optimization, a Laplacian smoothing operation is also introduced into our differential privacy ADMM framework, and it can smooth out the Gaussian noise used in the Gaussian mechanism. Then we propose an efficient differentially private variance reduced stochastic ADMM (DP-VRADMM) algorithm with Laplacian smoothing for both strongly convex and general convex objectives. As a by-product, we also present a new differentially private stochastic ADMM algorithm with DP guarantees. In theory, we provide both private guarantees and utility guarantees for the proposed algorithms, which show that Laplacian smoothing can improve the utility bounds of our algorithms. Experimental results on real-world datasets verify our theoretical results and the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

	abstract = {On-device deep learning is rapidly gaining popularity in mobile applications. Compared to offloading deep learning from smartphones to the cloud, on-device deep learning enables offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, such mechanisms inevitably store models on users’ smartphones and may invite adversarial attacks as they are accessible to attackers. Due to the characteristic of the on-device model, most existing adversarial attacks cannot be directly applied for on-device models. In this paper, we introduce a grey-box adversarial attack framework to hack on-device models by crafting highly similar binary classification models based on identified transfer learning approaches and pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. We evaluate the attack effectiveness and generality in terms of four different settings including pre-trained models, datasets, transfer learning approaches and adversarial attack algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed attacks remain effective regardless of different settings, and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We further conduct an empirical study on real-world deep learning mobile apps collected from Google Play. Among 53 apps adopting transfer learning, we find that 71.7% of them can be successfully attacked, which includes popular ones in medicine, automation, and finance categories with critical usage scenarios. The results call for the awareness and actions of deep learning mobile app developers to secure the on-device models. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/Jinxhy/SmartAppAttack .}

	abstract = {Steganography schemes based on a deflection criterion for embedding posses a clear advantage against schemes based on heuristics as they provide a direct link between theoretical detectability and empirical performance. However, this advantage depends on the accuracy of the cover and stego model underlying the embedding scheme. In this work we propose an original steganography scheme based on a realistic model of sensor noise, taking into account the camera model, the ISO setting and the processing pipeline. Exploiting this statistical model allows us to take correlations between DCT coefficients into account. Several types of dependency models are presented, including a very general lattice model which accurately models dependencies introduced by a large class of processing pipelines of interest. We show in particular that the stego signal which minimizes the KL divergence under this model has a covariance proportional to the cover noise covariance. The resulting embedding scheme achieves state-of-the-art performances which go well beyond the current standards in side-informed JPEG steganography.}

	abstract = {The introduction of Statistical Ineffective Fault Attacks (SIFA) has led to a renewed interest in fault attacks. SIFA requires minimal knowledge of the concrete implementation and is effective even in the presence of common fault or power analysis countermeasures. However, further investigations reveal that undesired and frequent ineffective events, which we refer to as the noise phenomenon, are the bottleneck of SIFA that can considerably diminish its strength. This includes noise associated with the attack’s setup and caused by the countermeasures utilized in the implementation. This research aims to address this significant drawback. We present two novel statistical fault attack variants that are far more successful in dealing with these noisy conditions. The first variant is the Statistical Effective Fault Attack (SEFA), which exploits the non-uniform distribution of intermediate variables in circumstances when the induced faults are effective. The idea behind the second proposed method, dubbed Statistical Hybrid Fault Attacks (SHFA), is to take advantage of the biased distributions of both effective and ineffective cases simultaneously. Our experimental results in various case studies, including noise-free and noisy setups, back up our reasoning that SEFA surpasses SIFA in several instances and that SHFA outperforms both or is at least as efficient as the best of them. For example, in the case of a 4-bits random-AND fault injected into the AES with a 35% missed fault rate, utilizing SEFA reduces the number of needed ciphertexts by 50%. In the same case study, SHFA can yield 10% and 55% reductions compared to SEFA and SIFA.}

	abstract = {Attribute-based encryption scheme is a promising mechanism to realize one-to-many fine-grained access control which strengthens the security in cloud computing. However, massive amounts of data and various data sharing requirements bring great challenges to the complex but isolated and fixed access structures in most of the existing attribute-based encryption schemes. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based hierarchical encryption scheme with extendable policy, called Extendable Hierarchical Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (EH-CP-ABE), to improve the data sharing efficiency and security simultaneously. The scheme realizes the function of hierarchical encryption, in which, data with hierarchical access control relationships could be encrypted together flexibly to improve the efficiency. The scheme also achieves external and internal extension of the access structure to further encrypt newly added hierarchical data without updating the original ciphertexts or with only a minor update depending on the data sharing requirements, which simplifies the encryption process and greatly reduces the computation overhead. We formally prove the security of the scheme is IND-CCA secure in the random oracle model based on bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption, and we also implement our scheme to demonstrate its efficiency and practicality.}

A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.}

	abstract = {We consider the critical problems of distributed computing and learning over data while keeping it private from the computational servers. The state-of-the-art approaches to this problem rely on quantizing the data into a finite field, so that the cryptographic approaches for secure multiparty computing can then be employed. These approaches, however, can result in substantial accuracy losses due to fixed-point representation of the data and computation overflows. To address these critical issues, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the privacy-preserving distributed computing problem when data is in the analog domain, e.g., the field of real/complex numbers. We characterize the privacy of the data from both information-theoretic and cryptographic perspectives, while establishing a connection between the two notions in the analog domain. More specifically, the well-known connection between the distinguishing security (DS) and the mutual information security (MIS) metrics is extended from the discrete domain to the analog domain. This is then utilized to bound the amount of information about the data leaked to the servers in our protocol, in terms of the DS metric, using well-known results on the capacity of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel with correlated noise. It is shown how the proposed framework can be adopted to do computation tasks when data is represented using floating-point numbers. We then show that this leads to a fundamental trade-off between the privacy level of data and accuracy of the result. By extending the setup to distributed learning, we show how to train a machine learning model using the proposed algorithm while keeping the data as well as the trained model private. Then numerical results are shown for experiments on several datasets. Furthermore, experimental advantages are shown comparing to fixed-point implementations over finite fields.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) can protect clients’ privacy from leakage in distributed machine learning. Applying federated learning to edge computing can protect the privacy of edge clients and benefit edge computing. Nevertheless, eavesdroppers can analyze the parameter information to specify clients’ private information and model features. And it is difficult to achieve a high privacy level, convergence, and low communication overhead during the entire process in the FL framework. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for edge computing (PFLF). In PFLF, each client and the application server add noise before sending the data. To protect the privacy of clients, we design a flexible arrangement mechanism to count the optimal training times for clients. We prove that PFLF guarantees the privacy of clients and servers during the entire training process. Then, we theoretically prove that PFLF has three main properties: 1) For a given privacy level and model aggregation times, there is an optimal number of participating times for clients; 2) There is an upper and lower bound of convergence; 3) PFLF achieves low communication overhead by designing a flexible participation training mechanism. Simulation experiments confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis. Therefore, PFLF helps design a framework to balance privacy levels and convergence and achieve low communication overhead when there is a part of clients dropping out of training.}

	abstract = {The operation of smart grids heavily relies on secure and accurate meter measurements provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs). Therefore, the optimal PMU placement (OPP) aiming to achieve the complete system observability of smart grids with as few PMUs as possible has been extensively investigated. Although many existing studies have focused on the OPP, few of them are concerned with the placement order of PMUs. To protect as many buses as possible in smart grids when installing PMUs in stages owing to high cost, this paper proposes the attack-resilient OPP strategy which places PMUs in order by using reinforcement learning guided tree search, where the sequential decision making of reinforcement learning is utilized to explore placement orders. The least-effort attack model is carried out to screen vulnerable buses such that the buses adjacent to these buses can be placed PMUs in advance to reduce the state space and action space of the large-scale smart grid environment. Based on that, the reinforcement learning guided tree search approach is used to explore the key buses which need placing PMUs, where the repeated exploration of the agent is avoided by tree search. Then, a reasonable placement order of PMUs is obtained according to the action sequence the proposed method provides. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on various IEEE standard test systems and the comparison results with existing methods are provided.}

However, to implement such caching mode, it is critical to ensure efficient security and privacy protection when vehicles access the cached content in fog nodes. In this paper, aiming at the security issue, a novel lightweight cryptography-based access control scheme for software defined vehicular networks (SDVN) is proposed, by using TESLA broadcast authentication protocol and Pederson commitment. The scheme realizes direct and efficient authentication between vehicles and fog nodes while limiting only legitimate vehicles can get request responses, and avoids limitations or deficiencies in existing access control schemes. Moreover, considering the limited cache space of the fog node, by utilizing the flexibility of the SDN paradigm, a cooperative cache update mechanism is provided. The security verification with ProVerif and detailed security analyses prove that the scheme can meet the security requirements in SDVN. And compared with the related works, our scheme achieves better performance in terms of computation and communication costs.}

	abstract = {Due to its high anti-counterfeiting and universality, the use of finger-vein pattern for identity authentication has recently attracted extensive attention in academia and industry. Despite recent advances in finger-vein recognition, most of the hand-crafted descriptors require strong prior knowledge, which may be ineffective in expressing its distinctiveness. In this paper, we present a novel compact multi-representation feature descriptor (CMrFD) with visual and semantic consistency, for finger-vein feature representation. Given the finger-vein images, we first form two-view representations to describe the informative vein features in local patches. Then, we jointly learn a feature transformation to map the two-view representations into discriminative binary codes. For the projection function, we linearly combine multi-view information and minimize the quantization error between the projected binary features and the original real-valued features. In terms of visual consistency, we minimize the Euclidean distance of each representation from the same class, at the same time, maximize the Euclidean distance from different classes in the projected space. Semantic consistency is used to ensure that similar images have compact multi-representation combined projection features. Lastly, we calculate the block-wise histograms as the final extracted features for finger-vein recognition. Experimental results on four widely used finger-vein databases demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art finger-vein recognition methods.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the defense strategy of remote state estimation under deception attacks. In order to prevent the stealthy attacker from reducing the estimation performance without triggering an alarm, an encoding-decoding mechanism combining linear transformation and artificial noise is proposed. Moreover, the detection performance under three different attack scenarios is analyzed. It is proved that the false data detector can effectively identify the attack or weaken its impact on the system under the proposed strategy, so as to ensure the security of the system. From the perspective of an attacker, an algorithm that can deduce the approximate values of the encoding parameters is also provided, which reveals how the magnitude of the artificial noise affects the accuracy of the attacker’s inference. Finally, a simulation example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach.}

	abstract = {We present a data-driven framework for learning fair universal representations (FUR) that guarantee statistical fairness for any learning task that may not be known a priori . Our framework leverages recent advances in adversarial learning to allow a data holder to learn representations in which a set of sensitive attributes are decoupled from the rest of the dataset. We formulate this as a constrained minimax game between an encoder and an adversary where the constraint ensures a measure of usefulness (utility) of the representation. The resulting problem is that of censoring, i.e., finding a representation that is least informative about the sensitive attributes given a utility constraint. For appropriately chosen adversarial loss functions, our censoring framework precisely clarifies the optimal adversarial strategy against strong information-theoretic adversaries; it also achieves the fairness measure of demographic parity for the resulting constrained representations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework on both synthetic and publicly available datasets. For these datasets, we use two tradeoff measures: censoring vs. representation fidelity and fairness vs. utility for downstream tasks, to amply demonstrate that multiple sensitive features can be effectively censored even as the resulting fair representations ensure accuracy for multiple downstream tasks.}

	abstract = {The secure authenticated key establishment between nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has not been fully solved in the existing schemes. It’s a good idea to apply the Diffie-Hellman protocol to address it perfectly, but the existing authenticated Diffie-Hellman (ADH) protocols are not perfect because their authentication are partial or delayed. In this paper, we first present a concept of full authentication and propose a new fully authenticated Diffie-Hellman (FADH) prototype with light-certificate-based authentication. And then based on the theory of elliptic curve cryptography, we construct the TinyADH (Tiny Authenticated Diffie-Hellman) protocol with applying the FADH in WSNs. Compared with the existing similar solutions, TinyADH has lower communication overload, is easier to implement into existing standards, and more secure under equivalent computational complexity. The experimental results show that using this scheme for a successful key agreement between two nodes averagely takes about 54 seconds on TelosB. Moreover, the simulation results indicate that repeated key agreement can improve the secure connectivity rate. However, considering the cost performance ratio, it is advisable to take 2 runs of the negotiation.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks cause model misbehaving by first implanting backdoors in deep neural networks (DNNs) during training and then activating the backdoor via samples with triggers during inference. The compromised models could pose serious security risks to artificial intelligence systems, such as misidentifying ‘stop’ traffic sign into ‘80km/h’. In this paper, we investigate the connection characteristic between the backdoor and the trigger in DNNs and observe the fact that the backdoor is implanted via establishing a link between a cluster of neurons, representing the backdoor, and the triggers. Based on this observation, we design LinkBreaker, a new generic scheme for defending against backdoor attacks. In particular, LinkBreaker deploys a neuron consistency check mechanism for identifying compromised neuron set related to the trigger. Then, the LinkBreaker regulates the model to make predictions based on benign neuron set only and thus breaks the link between the backdoor and the trigger. Compared to previous defenses, LinkBreaker offers a more general backdoor countermeasure that is not only effective against input-agnostic backdoors but also source-specific backdoors, which the later can not be defeated by majority of state-of-the-arts. Besides, LinkBreaker is robust against adversarial examples, which, to a large extent, provides a holistic defense against adversarial example attacks on DNNs, while almost all current backdoor defenses do not have such consideration and capability. Extensive experimental evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that LinkBreaker is with high efficacy of suppressing trigger inputs while incurring no noticeable accuracy deterioration on benign inputs.}

	abstract = {High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) double compression detection is of prime significance in video forensics. However, double compression with the same parameters and video content with high motion displacement intensity have become two main factors that limit the performance of existing algorithms. To address these issues, a novel motion-adaptive algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the analysis of GOP structure in HEVC standard and the coding process of HEVC double compression are provided. Next, sub-features composed of fluctuation intensities of intra prediction modes and unstable Prediction Units (PUs) in normal Intra-Frames (I-frames) and optical flow in adaptive I-frames are exploited in our algorithm. Each sub-feature is extracted during the process of multiple decompression. We further combine these sub-features into a 27-dimensional detection feature, which is finally fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. By following a separation-fusion detection strategy, the experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates superior robustness to various motion displacement intensities and a wide variety of coding parameter settings.}

	abstract = {Compared with single biometric recognition, multimodal biometric recognition based on fingerprint and finger vein has been widely considered because of its convenient sample collection, high security and accurate recognition. However, according to our investigation, there is no public dataset of fingerprint and finger vein collected at the same time. The existing work uses fingerprint datasets and finger vein datasets from different sources for research, besides the researchers data from building their own equipment, which lacks consideration of practical applications. This is not conducive to the promotion of multibiometric technology based on finger. To promote research on multimodal biometric recognition based on fingerprint and finger vein, we design a finger collection device and introduce a new dataset, NUPT-FPV. It is the first public dataset to collect fingerprint and finger vein simultaneously in real-world applications. NUPT-FPV obtained 840 finger information from 140 volunteers, each finger was collected 20 times (collected in two sessions), and 33600 fingerprint and finger vein images were obtained. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal fusion method based on a convolutional neural network as a benchmark. Extensive experiments were conducted to verify the necessity of our dataset. Through the released dataset and benchmark, we hope to further promote the development of multimodal biometrics based on fingerprint and finger vein.}

First, we use the short-time Fourier transform to represent speech signals with 2D spectrograms. Second, we iteratively find a safe vector using a spectrogram subspace projection operation. This operation minimizes the chordal distance adjustment between spectrograms with an additional regularization term. Third, we synthesize a spectrogram with such a safe vector using a novel GAN architecture trained with Sobolev integral probability metric. We impose an additional constraint on the generator network to improve the model’s performance in terms of stability and the total number of learned modes. Finally, we reconstruct the signal from the synthesized spectrogram and the Griffin-Lim phase approximation technique. We evaluate the proposed defense approach against six strong white and black-box adversarial attacks on DeepSpeech, Kaldi, and Lingvo models. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art defense algorithms in terms of accuracy and signal quality.}

	abstract = {Over the past years, the increasingly severe data island problem has spawned an emerging distributed deep learning framework—federated learning, in which the global model can be constructed over multiple participants without directly sharing their raw data. Despite its promising prospect, there are still many security challenges in federated learning, such as privacy preservation and integrity verification. Furthermore, federated learning is usually performed with the assistance of a center, which is prone to cause trust worries and communicational bottlenecks. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and verifiable decentralized federated learning framework, named PVD-FL, which can achieve secure deep learning model training under a decentralized architecture. Specifically, we first design an efficient and verifiable cipher-based matrix multiplication (EVCM) algorithm to execute the most basic calculation in deep learning. Then, by employing EVCM, we design a suite of decentralized algorithms to construct the PVD-FL framework, which ensures the confidentiality of both global model and local update and the verification of every training step. Detailed security analysis shows that PVD-FL can well protect privacy against various inference attacks and guarantee training integrity. In addition, the extensive experiments on real-world datasets also demonstrate that PVD-FL can achieve lossless accuracy and practical performance.}

The\ne⋅\nMMC, which consists of flash memory and the flash memory controller, optimizes the data input/output between the host device and the non-volatile memory through its standardized protocol. Its standardized structure and protocol makes forensic physical data acquisition simpler than handling the raw flash memory. However, its secure data purging features, such as Secure Erase and Sanitize, make data recovery from\ne⋅\nMMC a challenging task. In this research, we investigate inside the\ne⋅\nMMCs, and evaluate advanced data recovery procedures. By reverse engineering the structures of\ne⋅\nMMCs and accessing the internal flash memory, we discover that securely erased data is still recoverable from the internal flash memory. In some models, more than 99% of the securely erased data can still be recoverable by accessing the flash memory inside the\ne⋅\nMMCs.

Numerous algorithms and benchmark datasets have been introduced to develop robust models for the visible domain. However, varying conditions of illumination still pose challenging problems. In this regard, thermal cameras are employed to address this problem, because they operate on longer wavelengths. However, thermal face and facial landmark detection in the wild is an open research problem because most of the existing thermal datasets were collected in controlled environments. In addition, many of them were not annotated with face bounding boxes and facial landmarks. In this work, we present a thermal face dataset with manually labeled bounding boxes and facial landmarks to address these problems. The dataset contains 9,982 images of 147 subjects collected under controlled and uncontrolled conditions. As a baseline, we trained the YOLOv5 object detection model and its adaptation for face detection, YOLO5Face, on our dataset. In addition to our test set, we evaluated the models on the external RWTH-Aachen thermal face dataset to show the efficacy of our dataset. We have made the dataset, source code, and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/IS2AI/TFW to bolster research in thermal face analysis.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) aims at matching face images across different domains. It is challenging due to the severe domain discrepancies and overfitting caused by small training datasets. Some researchers apply a “recognition via generation” strategy and propose to solve the problem by translating images from a given domain into the visual domain. However, in many HFR tasks such as near-infrablack HFR, there is no paiblack data, which makes it an unsupervised generation. Pose variations, background differences, and many other factors present challenges. Moreover, the generated results lack diversity since many previous works regard this image translation as a “one-to-one” generation task. Considering the information deficiency in the input images, we propose to formulate this image translation process as a “one-to-many” generation problem. Specifically, we introduce reference images to guide the generation process. We propose a memory module to explore the prototypical style patterns of the reference domain. After self-supervised updating, the memory items are attentively aggregated to represent the style information. Moreover, to subtly fuse the contents of input images with the style of reference images, we propose a novel style transformer module. Specifically, we crop the encoded input and reference feature maps into patches, and use the style transformer to establish long-range dependencies between the input and reference patches. Thus, the style of every input patch is transferblack based on those of the most relevant reference patches. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for various HFR tasks, including NIR-VIS, thermal-VIS, sketch-photo, and gray-RGB, are conducted. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed MMTN are demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively.}

	abstract = {Two main privacy models for sanitising datasets are differential privacy (DP) and syntactic privacy . The former restricts individual values’ impact on the output based on the dataset while the latter restructures the dataset before publication to link any record to multiple sensitive data values. Besides both providing mechanisms to sanitise data, these models are often applied independently of each other and very little is known regarding how they relate. Knowing how privacy models are related can help us develop a deeper understanding of privacy and can inform how a single privacy mechanism can fulfil multiple privacy models. In this paper, we introduce a framework that determines if the privacy mechanisms of one privacy model can also guarantee privacy for another privacy model. We apply our framework to understand the relationship between DP and a form of syntactic privacy called\nt\n-closeness. We demonstrate, for the first time, how DP and\nt\n-closeness can be interpreted in terms of each other by introducing generalisations and extensions of both models to explain the transition from one model to the other. Finally, we show how applying one mechanism to guarantee multiple privacy models increases data utility compared to applying separate mechanisms for each privacy model.}

Still, progress is impeded due to small HFR data samples, task-specific models (one model trained for face sketch-photo matching can’t perform well for NIR-VIS face matching), joint learning of two different HFR scenarios are not possible by one single deep network, and models are not interpretable. In this paper, to solve these major problems, we presented a novel interpretable Local Frequency Binary Pattern ( LFrBP ) based continual learning shallow network for HFR. The model is divided into two parts. A modality-invariant CNN model using the LFrBP feature, fine-tuned with CNN, is presented in the first part. The second part is based on continual learning to jointly learn the two HFR scenarios (face sketch-photo and NIR-VIS face matching) using a single network. Recognition results on different challenging HFR databases depict the superiority of the proposed model over other state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods.}

	abstract = {Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been extensively studied by research communities to enhance the security of face recognition systems. Although existing methods have achieved good performance on testing data with similar distribution as the training data, their performance degrades severely in application scenarios with data of unseen distributions. In situations where the training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical approach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD performance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a non-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain, especially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student framework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class domain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework utilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this framework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide discriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are trained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for genuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity score between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used to distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework under one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and conducted extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines under one-class domain adaptation settings and even state-of-the-art methods with unsupervised domain adaptation.}

	abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) has been applied in deep learning for preserving privacy of the underlying training sets. Existing DP practice falls into three categories—objective perturbation (injecting DP noise into the objective function), gradient perturbation (injecting DP noise into the process of gradient descent) and output perturbation (injecting DP noise into the trained neural networks, scaled by the global sensitivity of the trained model parameters). They suffer from three main problems. First, conditions on objective functions limit objective perturbation in general deep learning tasks. Second, gradient perturbation does not achieve a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off due to over-injected noise in each epoch. Third, high utility of the output perturbation method is not guaranteed because of the loose upper bound on the global sensitivity of the trained model parameters as the noise scale parameter. To address these problems, we analyse a tighter upper bound on the global sensitivity of the model parameters. Under a black-box setting, based on this global sensitivity, to control the overall noise injection, we propose a novel output perturbation framework by injecting DP noise into a randomly sampled neuron (via the exponential mechanism) at the output layer of a baseline non-private neural network trained with a convexified loss function. We empirically compare the privacy-utility trade-off, measured by accuracy loss to baseline non-private models and the privacy leakage against black-box membership inference (MI) attacks, between our framework and the open-source differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) approaches on six commonly used real-world datasets. The experimental evaluations show that, when the baseline models have observable privacy leakage under MI attacks, our framework achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off than existing DP-SGD implementations, given an overall privacy budget $\\epsilon \\leq 1$ for a large number of queries.}

In this paper, we propose ETC-PS , a novel encrypted traffic classification method with path signature. We first construct the traffic path with a session packet length sequence to represent the interactions between the client and the server. Then, path transformations are conducted to exhibit its structure and obtain different information. A multiscale path signature is finally computed as a kind of distinctive feature to train the traditional machine learning classifier, which achieves highly robust accuracy and low training overhead. Six publicly available datasets with different traffic types of HTTPS/1, HTTPS/2, QUIC, VPN, non-VPN, Tor, and non-Tor are used to conduct closed-world and open-world evaluations to verify the effectiveness of ETC-PS .

	abstract = {Android security has received a lot of attention over the last decade, especially malware investigation. Researchers attempt to highlight applications’ security-relevant characteristics to better understand malware and effectively distinguish malware from benign applications. The accuracy and the completeness of their proposals are evaluated experimentally on malware and goodware datasets. Thus, the quality of these datasets is of critical importance: if the datasets are outdated or not representative of the studied population, the conclusions may be flawed. We specify different types of experimental scenarios. Some of them require unlabeled but representative datasets of the entire population. Others require datasets labeled with valuable characteristics that may be difficult to compute, such as malware datasets. We discuss the irregularities of datasets used in experiments, questioning the validity of the performances reported in the literature. This article focuses on providing guidelines for designing debiased datasets. First, we propose guidelines for building representative datasets from unlabeled ones. Second, we propose and experiment a debiasing algorithm that, given a biased labeled dataset and a target representative dataset, builds a representative and labeled dataset. Finally, from the previous debiased datasets, we produce datasets for experiments on Android malware detection or classification with machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that debiased datasets perform better when classifying with machine learning algorithms.}

	abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a popular technique for sequence alignment, and is the de facto standard for dynamic signature verification. In this paper, we go a significant step further to enhance DTW with the capability of deep representation learning, and propose an end-to-end trainable Deep soft-DTW (DsDTW) model for dynamic signature verification. Specifically, we design a convolutional recurrent adaptive network (CRAN) to process dynamic signatures, and utilize it to provide robust and discriminative local representations as inputs for DTW. As DTW is not fully differentiable with regard to its inputs, we introduce its smoothed formulation, soft-DTW, and incorporate the soft-DTW distances of signature pairs into the loss function for optimization. Because soft-DTW is differentiable, the proposed DsDTW is end-to-end trainable, and achieves an elegant integration of CRAN deep learning model and traditional DTW mechanism. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, and has won first place in the ICDAR 2021 competition for online signature verification.

	abstract = {Extensive studies have revealed that smart grid is vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. However, these strategies only focus on the cascading initiation phase to induce single-stage failures with multiple branch tripping, lacking of exploring the attack effectiveness in the propagation phase so that the deeply-hidden cascading failures are underestimated. In this paper, we propose a novel false load injection attack strategy that can intentionally penetrate into the cascading propagation phase to drive multi-stage dynamical failures with a cascading process. Specifically, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to model the adversarial game between operator and attacker. The former is in charge of security-constrained economic dispatching to minimize the generation cost, and the latter aims to maximize the cumulative number of tripped branches. Further, we reformulate this NP-hard bi-level problem as a mixed integer linear program for tractable computation. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on different-scale IEEE test systems to validate our strategy in driving the dynamical failures.}

	abstract = {Distributed learning is proposed as a promising technique to reduce heavy data transmissions in centralized machine learning. By allowing the participants training the model locally, raw data is unnecessarily uploaded to the centralized cloud server, reducing the risks of privacy leakage as well. However, the existing studies have shown that an adversary is able to derive the raw data by analyzing the obtained machine learning models. To tackle this challenge, the state-of-the-art solutions mainly depend on differential privacy and encryption techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption). Whereas, differential privacy degrades data utility and leads to inaccurate learning, while encryption based approaches are not effective to all machine learning algorithms due to the limited operations and excessive computation cost. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to resolve the privacy issues from the anonymous authentication approach. Different from the two types of existing solutions, this approach is generalized to all machine learning algorithms without reducing data utility, while guaranteeing privacy preservation. In addition, it can be integrated with detection schemes against data poisoning attacks and free-rider attacks, being more practical for distributed learning. To this end, we first design a pairing-based certificateless signature scheme. Based on the signature scheme, we further propose an anonymous and efficient authentication protocol which supports dynamic batch verification. The proposed protocol guarantees the desired security properties while being computationally efficient. Formal security proof and analysis have been provided to demonstrate the achieved security properties, including confidentiality, anonymity, mutual authentication, unlinkability, unforgeability, forward security, backward security, and non-repudiation. In addition, the performance analysis reveals that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the time consumption in batch verification, achieving high computational efficiency.}

	abstract = {This work presents a new paradigm for protection of sensitive inferences drawn from data streams with relevance to Internet-of-Things (IoT). This paradigm is an alternative to end-to-end encryption of entire data streams, or noise-addition based privatization mechanisms. It relies on the notion that raw data shared through IoTs are themselves not sensitive but for the inferences that can be drawn from them, and further, these inferences vary much slower than the collected data. Methodologies are developed that transform data streams into two parallel sub-streams of minimum sufficient and maximal irrelevant statistics, such that the sparse minimal sufficient stream can be protected using encryption, and the high rate irrelevant stream is guaranteed to provide perfect privacy for the underlying inference without any additional protection. This inferential separation is explored theoretically, where it is proved that the inference relevant (minimum sufficient) stream grows as\nO(logt)\nfor a data stream of length\nt\n. The approach is extended to bandwidth constrained devices, where a new optimal quantization scheme is presented that achieves maximum fidelity while guaranteeing privacy. The presented algorithms are demonstrated to practical IoT datasets where trained CNN based classifiers are shown to fail on the unprotected high rate stream.}

	abstract = {Although users can obtain various services by sharing their location information online with location-based service providers, it reveals sensitive information about users. However, existing privacy-preserving techniques in the online scenario suffer from the following shortcomings. First, they model the correlations between the real trajectory and the distorted trajectory as undirected, which makes them unable to accurately quantify the data privacy leakage caused by sharing the distorted trajectory. Second, they are unable to protect semantic privacy, i.e., attackers can obtain the victims’ visit purpose by using the Point of Interest information without knowing the real location data. Additionally, they fail to balance semantic-aware data utility and privacy protection. To make the case even worse, compared to the offline scenario, sharing trajectory online in real time does not have access to the overall location trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-aware privacy-preserving online location trajectory sharing mechanism, called SEmantic-aware Information-Theoretic Privacy (SEITP), to protect both data privacy and semantic privacy while the semantic-aware data utility can be preserved. In particular, we put forward two new metrics of privacy to capture data privacy leakage and semantic privacy leakage, respectively. Besides, to quantify the semantic-aware trajectory data utility, we propose a semantic-aware utility metric. With those metrics, the shortcoming of failing to guarantee the data utility is avoided naturally through structuring a multi-objective optimization problem. Then, we theoretically prove that the new construction can protect both data and semantic privacy. Finally, the experimental evaluations based on the real-world private vehicle trajectory dataset demonstrate that SEITP outperforms existing mechanisms.}

	abstract = {In recent years, face recognition has made a remarkable breakthrough due to the emergence of deep learning. However, compared with frontal face recognition, plenty of deep face recognition models still suffer serious performance degradation when handling profile faces. To address this issue, we propose a novel Frontal-Centers Guided Loss (FCGFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. Most existing discriminative feature learning approaches project features from the same class into a separated latent subspace. These methods only model the distribution at the identity-level but ignore the latent relationship between frontal and profile viewpoints. Different from these methods, FCGFace takes viewpoints into consideration by modeling the distribution at both the identity-level and the viewpoint-level. At the identity-level, a softmax-based loss is employed for a relatively rough classification. At the viewpoint-level, centers of frontal face features are defined to guide the optimization conducted in a more refined way. Specifically, our FCGFace is capable of adaptively adjusting the distribution of profile face features and narrowing the gap between them and frontal face features during different training stages to form compact identity clusters. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks, including cross-pose datasets (CFP-FP, CPLFW, VGGFace2-FP, and Multi-PIE) and non-cross-pose datasets (YTF, LFW, AgeDB-30, CALFW, IJB-B, IJB-C, and RFW), have demonstrated the superiority of our FCGFace over the SOTA competitors.}

	abstract = {Local features contain crucial clues for face anti-spoofing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful in extracting local features, but the intrinsic inductive bias of CNNs limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies. This paper aims to develop a simple yet effective framework that is versatile in extracting both local information and long-range dependencies for face anti-spoofing. To this end, we propose a novel architecture, namely Conv-MLP, which incorporates local patch convolution with global multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Conv-MLP breaks the inductive bias limitation of traditional full CNNs and can be expected to better exploit long-range dependencies. Furthermore, we design a new loss specifically for the face anti-spoofing task, namely moat loss. The moat loss benefits discriminative representations learning and can improve the generalization capability on unseen presentation attacks. In this work, multi-modal data are directly fused at the signal level to extract complementary features. Extensive experiments on single and multi-modal datasets demonstrate that Conv-MLP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while being more computationally efficient.

	abstract = {Finger vein modality plays an important role in biometrics due to its stability and security. However, existing state-of-the-art finger vein recognition systems adopt the transmission-based imaging mode with a sealed design, which requires redundant space in the imaging device and results in an uncomfortable user experience. Consequently, we design a reflection-based imaging device with an open structure to reduce the device volume and improve the portability, as well as the user experience. However, an open structure of the device inevitably introduces extra illumination variation to the image, which may deteriorate the performance of the system. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptation Finger Vein Network (DAFVN) to narrow the domain shift between different illumination data domains and extract illumination-invariant features from finger vein images, improving the robustness to illumination variations. To evaluate the performance of DAFVN and remedy the lack of a publicly open reflection-based finger vein database, we use the self-made device to construct the first large-scale reflection-based finger vein database, namely SCUT Reflective Imaging Finger Vein database (SCUT-RIFV). It includes 32,064 images from 167 subjects with five different illumination conditions. Abundant experiments implemented on the SCUT-RIFV database indicate that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the influence of illumination variation on the reflection-based finger vein recognition system.}

	abstract = {Cloud attack provenance is a well-established industrial practice for assuring transparency and accountability for a service provider to tenants. However, the multi-tenancy and self-service nature coupled with the sheer size of a cloud implies many unique challenges to cloud forensics. Although Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is a powerful tool for attack provenance due to the privilege isolation, the stealthiness of state-of-the-art attacks and the lack of precise information make existing attack provenance solutions difficult to fulfill real-time forensics when tracking enormous suspicious behaviors. To this end, we propose an instruction-level tracing framework for inspecting the presence of attacks by dynamically tracking shared processor hardware event patterns and analyzing the attack traces. To overcome the challenges of real-time detection and provenance, we advocate Last Branch Record (LBR) profiling, to extract the suspicious execution flows. With the hardware assistance and software-based virtualization introspection, we show that the framework can provide an effective response to threats in different cases, thereby enabling a quick attack provenance with high fidelity. The evaluation shows that our prototype introduces negligible performance penalties.}

	abstract = {Causal inference is widely used in clinical research, economic analysis, and other fields. As is the case with many statistical data, the findings of causal discovery (i.e., causal graph) might leak demographic information of participants. For example, a causal link between one genome and a rare disease can reveal the participation of a minority patient in genome-wide association studies. To date, differential privacy has served as the de facto foundation for guaranteeing the privacy of causal discovery algorithms. However, existing approaches to protecting causal discovery from privacy leakage rely heavily on private conditional independence tests, which generate a considerable amount of noise and are thus prone to inaccuracy. As a result of their limited accuracy and scalability, they are insufficient for non-trivial datasets (e.g., those with more than ten variables). In this paper, we advocate a novel focus on enforcing privacy for causal discovery algorithms based on functional causal models. First, we propose NoLeaks, a differentially private causal discovery algorithm, which manifests both high accuracy and efficiency compared with prior works. Second, we design a quasi-Newton numerical optimization algorithm for solving NoLeaks in a highly efficient way. Third, we evaluate NoLeaks using both public benchmarks and synthetic data. We observe that NoLeaks achieves comparable performance or even surpasses the state-of-the-art (non-private) approaches. We also find encouraging results that NoLeaks can smoothly scale to large datasets, on which existing works would fail. Through a case study and a downstream application, we observe encouraging results on the versatile usages of NoLeaks.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that robustness to adversarial attacks can be transferred across deep neural networks. In other words, we can make a weak model more robust with the help of a strong teacher model. In this paper, we ask if models can “learn together” and “teach each other” to achieve better robustness instead of learning from a static teacher. We study how interactions among models enhance robustness via knowledge distillation. We propose mutual adversarial training (MAT), in which multiple models are trained together and share the knowledge of adversarial examples to achieve improved robustness. MAT allows robust models to explore a larger space of adversarial samples and find more robust feature spaces and decision boundaries. Through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and mini-ImageNet datasets, we demonstrate that MAT can effectively improve model robustness and outperform state-of-the-art methods under white-box attacks. In addition, we show that MAT can also mitigate the robustness trade-off among different perturbation types. Specially, we train specialist models that learn to defend a specific perturbation type and a generalist model that learns to defend multiple perturbation types by learning from the specialists, which brings as much as 13.4% accuracy gain to AT baselines against the union of\nl\n∞\n,\nl\n2\n, and\nl\n1\nattacks. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate that collaborative learning is an effective strategy for designing robust models.}

	abstract = {To address the camera origin identification problem of inquiry images, many forensic methods have been proposed. However, the heavy computational overhead and the potential threat of privacy leakage for inquiry images make many existing forensic methods less applicable. Only a few research works have proposed secure forensic methods to address the aforementioned issues; however, they did not give a detailed analysis for the statistical performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving forensic method with analytical statistical performance to solve the camera model identification problem efficiently and securely. To preserve the privacy of inquiry images, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving scheme consisting of two operations: Position Scrambling Encryption to preserve the privacy of image content and Noise Linear-Mapping Processing to preserve the privacy of camera model identity for inquiry images. In the encrypted domain where the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is employed, we first propose a novel statistical noise model, which can accurately characterize an encrypted JPEG inquiry image. Then, a noise model-based detector is designed to identify different camera models. Experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method from both privacy-preserving and forensic effectiveness and report that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art secure forensic methods, especially when sample images used to estimate camera fingerprints are insufficient, such as only 2 available images.}

	abstract = {The Gaussian distribution is widely used in mechanism design for differential privacy (DP). Thanks to its sub-Gaussian tail, it significantly reduces the chance of outliers when responding to queries. However, it can only provide approximate\n(ε,δ(ε))\n-DP. In practice,\nδ(ε)\nmust be much smaller than the size of the dataset, which may limit the use of the Gaussian mechanism for large datasets with strong privacy requirements. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a new distribution for use in DP that is based on the Gaussian distribution, but has improved privacy performance. The so-called offset-symmetric Gaussian tail (OSGT) distribution is obtained through using the normalized tails of two symmetric Gaussians around zero. Consequently, it can still have sub-Gaussian tail and lend itself to analytical derivations. We analytically derive the variance of the OSGT random variable and\nδ(ε)\nof the single-dimensional OSGT mechanism. We extend the OSGT mechanism to\nk\n-dimensional queries, iteratively compute its\nδ\nk\n(ε)\n, derive its Rényi differential privacy, and study its composition. Numerical results show the OSGT mechanism can offer better privacy-utility performance compared to the Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms. We also derive a method for post processing the output of the OSGT mechanism to approximate the query based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation technique. The simulation results of such processing confirm the efficacy of the OSGT mechanism over the Gaussian mechanism.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks are increasingly popular in the field of radar high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) target recognition. Unfortunately, recent researches have revealed that a deep-learning classifier can be easily fooled by adding small perturbations to the input, named adversarial attack. This provides us an inspiration for radar deceptive jamming signal generation in electronic countermeasures (ECMs). However, the perturbations generated by these adversarial attacks are usually of complex envelopes and quite low power, making it challenging for jammers to generate such actual jamming signals. To solve that issue, we propose a practical deceptive jamming generation method that learns the vulnerable range cells in an HRRP sample and injects several jamming pulses with specific amplitudes into these range cells. Such jamming signals are easy to generate and can deceive the radar automatic target recognition (RATR) model to output the wrong target category prediction with high confidence. To avoid the requirement of the recognition network structure information, we leverage the differential evolution optimization algorithm (non-gradientbased). Further, to provide the potential of real-time jamming signal generation during the test, an encoder is constructed not only to learn the separable features but also to find the vulnerable range cells and the specific amplitudes of the jamming pulses. In the experiments, we apply the proposed attack algorithms to fool the one-dimensional convolutional neural network-based HRRPRATR models. The extensive experimental results on measured aircraft HRRP dataset prove that the proposed algorithms achieve a promising attack performance and serve as a practical and fast deceptive jamming generation method.}

	abstract = {Advances in facial manipulation technology have led to increasing indistinguishable and realistic face swap videos, which raises growing concerns about the security risk of deepfakes in the community. Although current deepfake detectors can gain promising performance when handling high-quality faces under within-database settings, most detectors suffer from performance degradation in cross-database evaluation. Moreover, when test faces’ quality is different from training faces, the performance degrades even under within-database settings. To this end, we propose a novel Localization invariance Siamese Network (LiSiam) to enforce localization invariance against different image degradation for deepfake detection. Specifically, our Siamese network-based feature extractor takes the original image and the corresponding quality-degraded image as pairwise inputs and outputs two segmentation maps. A localization invariance loss is further proposed to impose localization consistency between the two segmentation maps. In addition, we design a Mask-guided Transformer to capture the co-occurrence between the forgery region and its surroundings. Finally, a multi-task learning strategy is utilized to obtain a robust and discriminative feature representation and jointly optimize multiple objective functions (i.e., segmentation, classification, and localization invariance losses) in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e., FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method to state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WF) enables a local passive attacker to infer which website a user is visiting over an encrypted connection. Classifiers utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) automatically extract reliable features and have achieved up to 98% accuracy even against Tor. Since DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, several recent studies have exploited adversarial perturbations to defeat WF attacks. These defenses, however, require a high bandwidth overhead that typically exceeds 20% of the original traffic, prohibiting them from real-world deployment. Moreover, many studies on WF defense have been criticized for unrealistic assumptions such as full access to the target model and operating on the entire website trace. In this paper, we leverage adversarial patches—a special type of adversarial example that perturbs only local parts of the input—to control the overhead and enable black-box perturbation. In particular, we propose a new WF defense called Minipatch that injects extremely few dummy packets in real-time traffic to evade the attacker’s classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that Minipatch provides over 97% protection success rate with less than 5% bandwidth overhead, much lower than existing defenses. Moreover, we show that our adversarial patches remain effective in challenging settings, e.g., where dummy packets are injected only on the client-side and where perturbations are applied almost two months later. Finally, we also analyze several potential countermeasures and suggest ways to preserve perturbation effectiveness during deployment.}

In this study, we aim at a fine-grained question-level deception detection task, focusing on detecting whether a subject lies or not in answering each question rather than providing an overall “lie or not” judgement. A Graph-based Cross-modal Fusion Model (GCFM) is presented to learn the inherent associations among the subject’s reactions to different questions, plus a novel cross-modal attention mechanism to enhance the model’s learning capability. As revealed by the experimental results on the two datasets, the proposed graph-based GCFM outperformed eight other methods, and its two alternatives (clustering K-means based and sequential learning LSTM based methods), achieving accuracy 88.14% and 86.91% on the two datasets, respectively. Besides, through association learning, GCFM could increase the accuracy by 1.87% and 4.33% on the two datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its cross-modal attention mechanism led to the improvement of accuracy by 2.44% and 2.95% on the two datasets, respectively.}

In this work, we propose a novel double-stream architecture – Guided Erasable Adversarial Attack (GEAA) – for protecting high-quality labeled data with high commercial values under data-sharing scenarios. GEAA contains three phases, the double-stream adversarial attack, denoising reconstruction, and watermark extraction. Specifically, the double-stream adversarial attack injects erasable perturbations into the training data to avoid database abuse. The denoising reconstruction rebuilds the traceable denoising data from adversarial examples. The watermark extraction recovers identity information from the denoised data for copyright protection. Additionally, we introduce the annealing optimization strategy to balance these phases and a boundary constraint to degrade the availability of adversarial examples. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in data protection.

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging technology which allows a server to train a global model with the cooperation of participants without exposing the participants’ data. In recent years, there have been many studies focusing on maintaining participant privacy against honest-but-curious servers. In 2017, Google proposed a promising solution that applies double masking and secret sharing tools to protect participants’ gradients for each round of federated learning (CCS’17). However, this solution fails to achieve post-quantum security and costs high communication overhead to distribute secret shares. To address this problem, this work designs a lattice-based multi-use secret sharing scheme to avoid distributing new secret shares to all participants in each round of federated learning while achieving post-quantum security. In other words, this new tool allows each participant to update his secret shares locally while maintaining the privacy of participants’ gradients against quantum attacks. Finally, this work applies this new secret sharing technique to construct a lattice-based federated learning protocl LaF . The theoretic analysis demonstrates that LaF saves a lot of communication costs compared with Google’s solution, and the experimental results show that LaF achieves higher runtime efficiency.}

	abstract = {Face presentation attack detection (PAD) is essential to secure face recognition systems primarily from high-fidelity mask attacks. Most existing 3D mask PAD benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of mask identities, types of sensors, and a total number of videos; 2) low-fidelity quality of facial masks. Basic deep models and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods achieved acceptable performance on these benchmarks but still far from the needs of practical scenarios. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale Hi gh- Fi delity Mask dataset, namely HiFiMask . Specifically, a total amount of 54,600 videos are recorded from 75 subjects with 225 realistic masks by 7 new kinds of sensors. Along with the dataset, we propose a novel C ontrastive C ontext-aware L earning (CCL) framework. CCL is a new training methodology for supervised PAD tasks, which is able to learn by leveraging rich contexts accurately (e.g., subjects, mask material and lighting) among pairs of live faces and high-fidelity mask attacks. Extensive experimental evaluations on HiFiMask and three additional 3D mask datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The codes and dataset will be released soon.}

	abstract = {Analysis of imaging sensors is one of the most reliable photo forensic techniques, but it is increasingly challenged by complex image processing in modern cameras. The underlying photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) is distilled into a static sensor fingerprint unique for each device. This makes it easy to estimate and spoof and limits its reliability in face of sophisticated attackers. We propose to exploit computational capabilities of emerging intelligent vision sensors to design next-generation computational sensor fingerprints . Such sensors allow for running neural network inference directly on raw pixels, which enables end-to-end optimization of the entire photo acquisition and distribution pipeline. Control over fingerprint generation allows for adaptation to various requirements and threat models. In this study we provide a detailed assessment of security properties and evaluate two approaches to prevent spoofing: fingerprint generation based on local image content and adversarial training. We found that adversarial training is currently impractical, but content fingerprints deliver good performance in the considered cross-domain (RAW-RGB) setting and could provide robust best-effort protection against photo manipulation. Moreover, computational fingerprints can alleviate other limitations of PRNU, e.g., its limited reliability for dark/texture content and expensive fingerprint storage that hinders scalability. To enable this line of work, we developed a novel open-source and high-fidelity simulation environment for modeling photo acquisition and distribution pipelines ( https://github.com/pkorus/neural-imaging ).}

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving data analysis is an emerging area that addresses the dilemma of performing data analysis on user data while protecting users’ privacy. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing privacy-preserving $K$ -means clustering protocol for data analysis that provides local privacy to users’ data. To enable a desirable degree of local privacy guarantee while maintaining high accuracy of the clustering, we adopt a generalized differential privacy definition, ${d}_{\\chi} $ -privacy, which quantifies the distinguishability level based on the distance between data records defined by the distance function ${d}_{\\chi} $ . In our work, we consider the space of data points as a metric space imbued with Euclidean distance and propose a bounded perturbation mechanism (BPM) with bounded sampling space of the perturbed data points, which is formally shown to achieve ${d}_{\\chi} $ -privacy. BPM perturbs the data as a whole instead of treating each dimension independently, which is desirable since the privacy budget is no longer required to be split among different dimensions. Bounded output space also means that we will not get into the case where the report or the statistical result is so far out of the data domain that it is hard to interpret. Furthermore, it can also help in limiting the amount of bandwidth needed to send such report to the server. The design of BPM is based on a probability density function which decreases exponentially as the Euclidean distance with respect to the true value grows. It is also designed with the aim of ensuring that BPM produces perturbed data that provides the claimed privacy guarantee while ensuring high utility response. To guarantee the efficiency of the perturbation method, we propose an efficient algorithm to sample from the proposed distribution and apply BPM to the design of ${d}_{\\chi} $ -private $K$ -means clustering algorithms. Lastly, we analyse the privacy and utility guarantee provided by the proposed method and provide its experimental results.}

	abstract = {It has been witnessed that Aggregate Reverse Skyline (ARS) query has recently received a wide range of practical applications due to its marvelous property of identifying the influence of query requests. Nevertheless, the query users may hesitate to participate in such query services as the query requests and query results may leak sensitive personal data or valuable business data assets to the service providers. To tackle the concerns, a promising solution is to encrypt the query requests, conduct the ARS queries over encrypted query requests without decrypting, and return the encrypted query results. Unfortunately, many existing solutions are either deployed over a two-server model or unable to fully preserve query privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving aggregate reverse skyline query (PPARS) scheme on a single server model while ensuring full query privacy. Specifically, we first transform the problem of ARS query into a combination of set membership test and logical expressions. Then, by employing the prefix encoding technique, bloom filter technique, and fully homomorphic encryption, we run the transformed logical expressions to obtain the encrypted aggregate values without leaking query requests, query results, and access patterns. Furthermore, we propose an interpolation-based packing technique to improve the communication efficiency of PPARS. Detailed and formal security analysis demonstrates that our proposed schemes can guarantee strong security. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results validate the efficiency of our proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Homomorphic encryption (HE) is being widely used for privacy-preserving computation. Since HE schemes only support polynomial operations, it is prevalent to use polynomial approximations of non-polynomial functions. We cannot monitor the intermediate values during the homomorphic evaluation; as a consequence, we should utilize polynomial approximations with sufficiently large approximation intervals to prevent the failure of the evaluation. However, the large approximation interval potentially accompanies computational overheads, and it is a serious bottleneck of HE application on real-world data. In this work, we introduce domain extension polynomials (DEPs) that extend the domain interval of functions by a factor of $k$ while preserving the feature of the original function on its original domain interval. By repeatedly iterating the domain-extension process with DEPs, we can extend with $O(\\log {K})$ operations the domain of a given function by a factor of $K$ while the feature of the original function is preserved in its original domain interval. By using DEPs, we can efficiently evaluate in an encrypted state a function that converges at infinities, i.e., $\\lim _{x\\to \\infty }f(x)$ and $\\lim _{x\\to -\\infty }f(x)$ exist in $\\mathbb {R}$ . To uniformly approximate the function on $[-R,R]$ , our method exploits $O(\\log {R})$ operations and $O(1)$ memory. This is more efficient than the previous approach, the minimax approximation and Paterson-Stockmeyer algorithm, which uses $\\Omega (\\sqrt {R})$ multiplications and $\\Omega (\\sqrt {R})$ memory for the evaluation. As another application of DEPs, we also suggest a method to manage the risky outliers from a large interval $[-R,R]$ by using $O(\\log {R})$ additional multiplications. As a real-world application, we trained the logistic regression classifier on large public datasets in an encrypted state by using our method. We exploit our method to the evaluation of the logistic function on large intervals, e.g., [−7683, 7683].}

	abstract = {When using location-based services (LBSs), a user obtains points-of-interest (PoI) information by providing the LBS platform with his current geo-location.

Traditional\nk\n-anonymity mechanisms instruct a user to bear the overhead to report his current location together with\nk−1\ndummy locations to confuse the adversary, which only work well given a large number\nk\n. Aware of the common practices that a user is actually flexible in service requirement (e.g., as long as the searched PoIs are within his walking distance), we propose a novel approach to help the user gain location privacy from service flexibility for the challenging case of a small number\nk\n. By analyzing the strategic interaction between the user and the adversary in a dynamic Bayesian game, we prove that the user’s equilibrium strategy depends on the adversary’s capability of accessing geo-data. Take\nk=2\nfor example, we find that if the adversary is not likely to access both geo-data, the user should report the two dummy locations at two different directions of his real location, and otherwise at the same direction. Perhaps surprisingly, the user may benefit from the adversary’s access to more geo-data. Furthermore, we extend the game-theoretic approach for multi-query and arbitrary user location distributions. Numerical results show that our approach obviously outperforms\nk\n-anonymity mechanisms especially under a small number\nk\n.}

Based on the eye-tracking data, we extract visual states and attention states as system-level sufficient statistics to characterize the user’s visual behaviors and attention status. By adopting a data-driven approach and two learning feedback of different time scales, this work lays out a theoretical foundation to analyze , evaluate , and particularly modify humans’ attention processes while they vet and recognize phishing emails. We corroborate the effectiveness , efficiency , and robustness of ADVERT through a case study based on the data set collected from human subject experiments conducted at New York University. The results show that the visual aids can statistically increase the attention level and improve the accuracy of phishing recognition from 74.6% to a minimum of 86%. The meta-adaptation can further improve the accuracy to 91.5% (resp. 93.7%) in less than 3 (resp. 50) tuning stages.}

	abstract = {Geotagging images of interest are increasingly important to law enforcement, national security, and journalism. Today, many images do not carry location tags that are trustworthy and resilient to tampering; and landmark-based visual clues may not be readily present in every image, especially in those taken indoors. In this paper, we exploit an environmental signature from the power grid, the electric network frequency (ENF) signal, which can be inherently captured in a sensing stream at the time of recording and carries useful time–location information. Compared to the recent art of extracting ENF traces from audio and video recordings, it is very challenging to extract an ENF trace from a single image. We address this challenge by first mathematically examining the impact of the ENF embedding steps such as electricity to light conversion, scene geometry dilution of radiation, and image sensing. We then incorporate the verified parametric models of the physical embedding process into our proposed entropy minimization method. The optimized results of the entropy minimization are used for creating a two-level ENF presence–classification test for region-of-capturing localization. It identifies whether a single image has an ENF trace; if yes, whether it is at 50 or 60 Hz. We quantitatively study the relationship between the ENF strength and its detectability from a single image. This paper is the first comprehensive work to bring out a unique forensic capability of environmental traces that shed light on an image’s capturing location.}

	abstract = {One common task in image forensics is to detect spliced images, where multiple source images are composed to one output image. Most of the currently best performing splicing detectors leverage high-frequency artifacts. However, after an image underwent strong compression, most of the high frequency artifacts are not available anymore. In this work, we explore an alternative approach to splicing detection, which is potentially better suited for images in-the-wild, subject to strong compression and downsampling. Our proposal is to model the color formation of an image. The color formation largely depends on variations at the scale of scene objects, and is hence much less dependent on high-frequency artifacts. We learn a deep metric space that is on one hand sensitive to illumination color and camera white-point estimation, but on the other hand insensitive to variations in object color. Large distances in the embedding space indicate that two image regions either stem from different scenes or different cameras. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed embedding space outperforms the state of the art on images that have been subject to strong compression and downsampling. We confirm in two further experiments the dual nature of the metric space, namely to both characterize the acquisition camera and the scene illuminant color. As such, this work resides at the intersection of physics-based and statistical forensics with benefits from both sides.}

Since these identifiers generally contain personal identifiable information (PII) about the entities, record linkage algorithms need to be developed with privacy constraints. Known as privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL), many research studies have been conducted to perform the linkage on encoded and/or encrypted identifiers. Differential privacy (DP) combined with computationally efficient encoding methods, e.g. Bloom filter encoding, has been used to develop PPRL with provable privacy guarantees. The standard DP notion does not however address other constraints, among which the most important ones are fairness-bias and cost of linkage in terms of number of record pairs to be compared. In this work, we propose new notions of fairness-constrained DP and fairness and cost-constrained DP for PPRL and develop a framework for PPRL with these new notions of DP combined with Bloom filter encoding. We provide theoretical proofs for the new DP notions for fairness and cost-constrained PPRL and experimentally evaluate them on two datasets containing person-specific data. Our experimental results show that with these new notions of DP, PPRL with better performance (compared to the standard DP notion for PPRL) can be achieved with regard to privacy, cost and fairness constraints.}

	abstract = {Full face synthesis and partial face manipulation by virtue of the generative adversarial networks (GANs) and its variants have raised wide public concerns. In the multi-media forensics area, detecting and ultimately locating the image forgery has become an imperative task. In this work, we investigate the architecture of existing GAN-based face manipulation methods and observe that the imperfection of upsampling methods therewithin could be served as an important asset for GAN-synthesized fake image detection and forgery localization. Based on this basic observation, we have proposed a novel approach, termed FakeLocator , to obtain high localization accuracy, at full resolution, on manipulated facial images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt to solve the GAN-based fake localization problem with a gray-scale fakeness map that preserves more information of fake regions. To improve the universality of FakeLocator across multifarious facial attributes, we introduce an attention mechanism to guide the training of the model. To improve the universality of FakeLocator across different DeepFake methods, we propose partial data augmentation and single sample clustering on the training images. Experimental results on popular FaceForensics++, DFFD datasets and seven different state-of-the-art GAN-based face generation methods have shown the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the baselines, our method performs better on various metrics. Moreover, the proposed method is robust against various real-world facial image degradations such as JPEG compression, low-resolution, noise, and blur.}

	abstract = {Greybox fuzzing has been widely used in stateless programs and has achieved great success. However, most state-of-the-art greybox fuzzers have slow speed and shallow state depth coverage in fuzzing stateful network protocol programs, which are able to remember and store the details of interactions. The existing greybox fuzzers for network protocol programs first send a series of well-defined prefix sequences of input messages and then send mutated messages to test the target state of a stateful network protocol. This process leads to a high time cost. In this paper, we propose SNPSFuzzer, a fast greybox fuzzer for stateful network protocols using snapshots. SNPSFuzzer dumps the context information when the network protocol program is in a specific state and restores it when the state needs to be fuzzed. Furthermore, we design a message chain analysis algorithm to explore more and deeper network protocol states. Our evaluation shows that compared with the state-of-the-art network protocol greybox fuzzer AFLNET, SNPSFuzzer improves the message processing speed of network protocol fuzzing by 70.7% and increases the path coverage by 20.9% on average within 24 hours. Moreover, SNPSFuzzer exposes a previously unreported vulnerability in the program Tinydtls.}

The conventional IDS deployment architectural designs show limitations in ensuring the security of MCWSNs due to the limited monitoring range of the nodes. This paper proposes an efficient IDS deployment architecture for MCWSNs. The architecture is a hybrid design, in which the cluster heads and the sink collaboratively act as IDS agents to monitor the entire network and perform intrusion detection. Based on the new architecture, this paper proposes a resource allocation model to optimally allocate resources among the IDS agents so that the network’s security metric can be maximized. A comprehensive analytical framework is proposed to analyze the optimality of the model’s solution, and an efficient computational approach is developed to obtain the optimal resource allocation strategy. Extensive numerical simulation and comparison studies are conducted to validate the proposed method.}

	abstract = {The so-called behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) is expected to solve effectively a variety of security issues by detecting the deviances from normal behavioral patterns of protected agents. We propose a new graph-based behavioral modeling paradigm for BAD problem, named behavioral identification graph (BIG), which has distinct advantages over existing methods by mining deeply the property-level (as an enhancement to the event-level ) associations in behavioral data. Under BIG, the behavioral properties and their co-occurrence associations in behavioral data are modeled as the entities and relationships of graph, respectively; furthermore, behavioral properties and events are both vectorized by a devised event-property composite model, and the behavioral patterns of agents are finally represented as a multidimensional spatial distribution of behavioral properties. Consequently, for a behavior, the intensity of its behavioral anomaly can be transformed into the spatial decentrality of its behavioral agent and properties which contain both fine-grained information between behavioral properties and coarse-grained information between behavioral events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve behavioral modeling for anomaly detection by integrating inter (event-level) and intra (property-level) associations of behaviors into a unified graph and space. Our method is validated by four representative security issues, i.e., fraud detection in online payment services (by transaction behaviors), intrusion detection in network communication services (by traffic behaviors), insider threat detection in organizational information systems (by system behaviors), and compromise detection in social networking services (by trajectory behaviors).}

To support our claim, we discuss the differences and similarities of recently proposed modeling attacks and offer a fair comparison of the performance of these attacks by implementing all of them using the popular machine learning framework Keras and comparing their performance against the well-studied Logistic Regression attack. Our findings show that neural-network-based modeling attacks have the potential to outperform traditional modeling attacks on PUFs and must hence become part of the standard toolbox for PUF security analysis; the code and discussion in this paper can serve as a basis for the extension of our results to PUF designs beyond the scope of this work.}

While many defense mechanisms are presented to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks, attackers constantly explore alternative approaches for orchestrating novel DDoS attacks. Distribution of the mechanism and its deployment into different zones can improve the accuracy and coverage of DDoS attack varieties. In this paper, we propose a 3-phase DDoS attack countermeasure, named\nRAD\n, based on a statistical model for scoring users in order to detect DDoS attacks. In the first phase, users are classified into either suspicious or benign based on their traffic behavior, being indicated by the number of flows, packets, concurrent connections, and amount of user-generated traffic. In the second phase, we identify a potential attack state using the drop, jitter, and delay processing parameters. In the third phase, relevant policies are enforced on the suspicious class of users and its effects are assessed continuously in order to reduce false alarms.\nRAD\nis evaluated through the UNB CICDDoS2019 dataset and is compared with four well-known DDoS detection algorithms.\nRAD\ncounters DDoS attacks with more than 80% precision, 99% recall, and 89% F1-Measure in CICDDoS2019.}

	abstract = {Metadata plays an essential role in facilitating data organizing, finding, and understanding, but it also contains lots of sensitive information about the data and the data users, e.g., the location where a picture was taken. In practice, when sensitive data is encrypted before being uploaded to untrusted public clouds, an oblivious dilemma comes: if the metadata is totally encrypted, and its functionalities no longer exist; otherwise, sensitive information may be leaked. Hence, a secure and flexible mechanism for processing different fields (marked private or public for different scenario needs) of metadata simultaneously is desirable. We searched the literature for methods of achieving such a goal, it turned out that this was not explicitly considered or reasonably solved before. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of constructing privacy-enhancing metadata, namely, 1) flexible and tamper-resistant metadata setting, 2) owner-enabled secure search authorization with explicit metadata. Based on the concept of public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS), we propose a novel Authorized Keyword Search over Encrypted Data with Metadata scheme (MD-AKS), which firstly well addressed the above demands. We formalize the security model and prove the security of MD-AKS scheme. Our work maximizes the flexibility of metadata setting in two aspects: the associated metadata can be set as an arbitrary string and the costs of clients are independent of explicit metadata’s complexity. We implement MD-AKS, the theoretical comparison and experiment results further demonstrate the usability and scalability.}

Face sketch synthesis (FSS) has promising prospects in the fields of entertainment and law enforcement, where it plays an increasingly important role. We propose a novel generative adversarial network for synthesizing sketches with similar shapes and rich details to photos. This problem is challenging because it involves the transition between the sketch domain and the photo domain. Many methods have been used for face sketch synthesis in recent years, but existing methods cannot fully exploit the semantic information between different domains. To this end, we use a cross-domain face sketch synthesis framework based on edge-preserving filters to make the boundaries of different semantics in semantic layouts have a smooth transition. We further propose a new spatially adaptive denormalization module named edge-aware enhancement Spatially Adaptive DEnormalization (eaeSPADE), which can make full use of the semantic information in the semantic layout of faces and improve the details of the synthesized face images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing face sketch synthesis methods.}

	abstract = {Blockchain is a technology with decentralization and immutability features and has been employed for auditing by many applications. However, immutability sometimes limits the application of blockchain technology. For example, vulnerable smart contracts on blockchain cannot be redacted due to immutability. The existing redactable blockchain solutions either have a low efficiency or violate the decentralization feature. Moreover, those solutions lack mechanisms for tracing redaction history and checking block consistency. In this paper, we present an efficient redactable blockchain with traceability in the decentralized setting. Specifically, we propose a decentralized chameleon hash function for redactable blockchain that every redaction must be approved by multiple blockchain nodes. We also design a redactable blockchain structure that maintains all redactions of a block and encodes the redacted blocks into an RSA accumulator. Then, we propose an efficient block consistency check protocol based on the RSA accumulator. Finally, we conduct experiments and compare our scheme with another decentralized redactable blockchain to demonstrate that our solution is efficient in practice.}

	abstract = {This paper considers satellite eavesdroppers in uplink satellite communication systems where the eavesdroppers are randomly distributed at arbitrary altitudes according to homogeneous binomial point processes and attempt to overhear signals that a ground terminal transmits to a serving satellite. Non-colluding eavesdropping satellites are assumed, i.e., they do not cooperate with each other, so that their received signals are not combined but are decoded individually. Directional beamforming with two types of antennas: fixed- and steerable-beam antennas, is adopted at the eavesdropping satellites. The possible distribution cases for the eavesdropping satellites and the distributions of the distances between the terminal and the satellites are analyzed. The distributions of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at both the serving satellite and the most detrimental eavesdropping satellite are derived as closed-form expressions. The ergodic and outage secrecy capacities of the systems are derived with the secrecy outage probability using the SNR distributions. Simpler approximate expressions for the secrecy performance are obtained based on the Poisson limit theorem, and asymptotic analyses are also carried out in the high-SNR regime. Monte-Carlo simulations verify the analytical results for the secrecy performance. The analytical results are expected to be used to evaluate the secrecy performance and design secure satellite constellations by considering the impact of potential threats from malicious satellite eavesdroppers.}

As a result, it is critical to validate the authenticity of the uploaded document images to protect against attacks from malicious users. Out of various types of attacks, the recapture attack (by reprinting and recapturing) is effective in concealing the trace of document forgeries. However, detecting the recaptured document images is challenging. To address this problem, we first study the halftone cell distortion introduced in both the genuine and recaptured document images. Based on our study, a unified model that characterizes the halftone cell distortion (e.g., errors in size and displacement) is then proposed for accurate estimation of the distortion parameters. The statistics of the estimated parameters are then exploited in a hypothesis testing framework to detect the recaptured document images. The questioned document image can be authenticated by testing against the null hypothesis, i.e., the image is a genuine sample. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach under different application scenarios, extensive experiments are conducted with different prior knowledge of printers (known printer model, known printing technique, and In-The-Wild (unknown printing device and document contents)). The experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms the data-driven benchmark approaches by a significant margin. Specifically, under the In-The-Wild experiment protocol, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of the proposed approach is above 0.87 while the AUC of the benchmark approaches (even some utilize both genuine and recaptured samples) degrades to less than 0.77.}

	abstract = {Backscatter communication (BC) enables ultra-low-power communications and allows devices to harvest energy simultaneously. But its practical deployment faces severe security threats caused by its nature of openness and broadcast. Authenticating backscatter devices (BDs) is treated as the first line of defense. However, complex cryptographic approaches are not desirable due to the limited computation capability of BDs. Existing physical layer authentication schemes cannot effectively support BD mobility, multiple attacker identification and attacker location tracing in an integrated way. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes BCAuth, a multi-stage authentication and attack tracing scheme based on the physical spatial information of BDs to realize enhanced BD authentication security for both static and mobile BDs. After initial authentication based on BD identity with its position information registration, preemptive authentication and re-authentication are performed according to spatial correlation of backscattered signal source locations associated with the BD. By exploiting clustering-based analysis on spacial information, BCAuth is capable of determining the number of attackers and localizing their positions. In addition, we propose a reciprocal channel-based method for BD re-authentication with better authentication performance than the clustering-based method for mobile BDs when the BDs is able to measure received signal strength (RSS), which also enables mutual authentication. We theoretically analyze BCAuth security and conduct extensive numerical simulations with various settings to show its desirable performance.}

However, due to the centrality of federated learning framework and the untrustworthiness of clients, traditional federated learning solutions are vulnerable to poisoning attacks from malicious clients and servers. In this paper, we aim to mitigate the impact of the central server and malicious clients by designing a Privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust Federated Learning (PBFL) scheme based on blockchain. Specifically, we use cosine similarity to judge the malicious gradients uploaded by malicious clients. Then, we adopt fully homomorphic encryption to provide secure aggregation. Finally, we use blockchain system to facilitate transparent processes and implementation of regulations. Our formal analysis proves that our scheme achieves convergence and provides privacy protection. Our extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our scheme is robust and efficient. Even if the root dataset is small, our scheme can achieve the same efficiency as FedSGD.}

	abstract = {Aiming for minimizing passengers’ waiting time and vehicles’ vacancy rate, online car-hailing service systems with fog computing has been deployed in various scenarios. In this paper, we focus on addressing the security and privacy issues in such a promising system by customizing a new cryptographic primitive to provide the following security guarantees: (1) private, fine-grained and bilateral order matching between passengers and drivers; (2) authenticity verification of passengers’ orders in the form of ciphertext, and (3) temporal assurance of passengers’ ciphertext orders. To the best of our knowledge, no previous system has been designed to meet all three requirements. Existing cryptographic primitives (including forward/puncturable encryption (FE/PE) and attribute based matchmaking encryption (AB-ME)) may be leveraged to partially address some of challenges, but there lacks a comprehensive solution. Moreover, the integration of existing works is hampered by the heterogeneity and the weak coupling between distinct cryptographic primitives. As a result, it is infeasible to directly exploit them for the online car-hailing service. To tackle that, we put forward a new cryptographic primitive called Fine-grained Puncturable Matchmaking Encryption ( FP-ME ) by modifying AB-ME and incorporating PE technology. FP-ME can simultaneously implement fine-grained and bilateral order matching, the authenticity of passengers’ orders, and meeting the time constraint of passengers’ orders. We formalize the adversarial models for the proposed FP-ME and then present rigorous security analysis to prove the security of the proposed system. Additionally, we study performance of the system via simulations to demonstrate its practicability and effectiveness in the real-world applications.}

	abstract = {GEA-1 and its successor GEA-2 are two stream ciphers, designed to protect against eavesdropping General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) between the phone and the base station. They were widely used for GPRS encryption in the late 1990s and during the 2000s, and are surprisingly still supported in a range of current mobile phones. In this paper, new key recovery attacks on GEA-1 and GEA-2 are proposed by combining with the time-memory trade-off technique. The new attacks significantly reduce the time and memory costs of the previous attacks on GEA-1, and show that GEA-1 only offers 32-bit (out of 64) security. Furthermore, the slide properties of GEA-1 and GEA-2 are first found and used to explore practical related key attacks. The results show that GEA-1 and GEA-2 can be broken on a common PC within about 0.81 and 6.2 seconds in the multiple related key setting, respectively. Finally, an improved variant of GEA-2 called GEA-2a is proposed. The reasons for making the changes from GEA-2 are explained in detail, which indicates that GEA-2a has significantly better resistance than GEA-2 against all known attacks and can offer 64-bit security.}

	abstract = {Recapturing attack can be employed as a simple but effective anti-forensic tool for digital document images. Inspired by the document inspection process that compares a questioned document against some known samples, we proposed a document recapture detection scheme by employing a Siamese network to compare and extract distinct features in a recaptured document image. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of both metric learning and image forensic techniques, and forms triplets by considering some important factors in document authentication, e.g., document types, resolutions, and content in each image patch. After training with our triplet selection strategy, the resulting feature embedding clusters the genuine samples near the reference while pushing the recaptured samples apart. In the experiment, we consider practical settings under domain differences, such as the variations in printing/imaging devices, substrates, recapturing channels, and document types. To evaluate the robustness of different approaches, we benchmark some popular off-the-shelf machine learning-based approaches, a state-of-the-art document image detection scheme, and the proposed schemes with different network backbones under various experimental protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under different experimental settings. Specifically, under the most challenging scenario in our experiment, i.e., evaluation across different types of documents (produced by different manufacturers, devices, and substrates), we have achieved 6.92% APCER (Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate) and 8.51% BPCER (Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate) by the proposed network with ResNeXt101 backbone at 5.00% BPCER decision threshold.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the power allocation problem for secure multiple-input single-output transmission with the injection of artificial noise (AN), in the presence of an unknown eavesdropper (Eve). Two power allocation schemes, the optimal adaptive power allocation (OAPA) and suboptimal fixed power allocation (SFPA) schemes, are proposed to enhance the physical layer security of the considered system. Since the noise power at Eve is unknown, both power allocation schemes are designed for the worst-case scenario in which the noise power at Eve is assumed to be zero, aiming to minimize the secrecy outage probability (SOP). To characterize the performance of the proposed power allocation schemes, approximate closed-form expressions for average SOP under a preset noise power level are derived by applying Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. We also address the worst-case secrecy outage performance for the proposed OAPA and SFPA schemes. Our analytical and numerical results show that, compared with the exhaustive search method that requires Eve’s prior information, the proposed OAPA scheme exhibits comparable secrecy outage performance without Eve’s prior information. Additionally, the SFPA scheme, also without Eve’s prior information, is capable of achieving almost the same worst-case SOP as the OAPA scheme, with a much lower implementation complexity.}

This paper investigates the impact of outdated CSI on the achievable covert communication performance in a two-hop wireless relay system under two typical covert transmission schemes of rate-control transmission (RCT) and power-control transmission (PCT). We first apply the typical channel feedback delay model to determine the statistical distribution of outdated CSI, based on which we then develop theoretical models to depict the inherent relationship between outdated CSI and the fundamental covert performance metrics in terms of detection error probability (DEP) and covert rate (CR). With the help of these models, we further explore the optimization of DEP subject to the CR constraint as well as the optimization of CR subject to the DEP constraint to reveal the max-min DEP performance and the maximal CR performance with the outdated CSI. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to illustrate the impact of outdated CSI on the covert communication performance.}

	abstract = {Many real-world networks are inherently decentralized. For example, in social networks, each user maintains a local view of a social graph, such as a list of friends and her profile. It is typical to collect these local views of social graphs and conduct graph learning tasks. However, learning over graphs can raise privacy concerns as these local views often contain sensitive information. In this paper, we seek to ensure private graph learning on a decentralized network graph. Towards this objective, we propose Solitude , a new privacy-preserving learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs), with formal privacy guarantees based on edge local differential privacy. The crux of Solitude is a set of new delicate mechanisms that can calibrate the introduced noise in the decentralized graph collected from the users. The principle behind the calibration is the intrinsic properties shared by many real-world graphs, such as sparsity. Unlike existing work on locally private GNNs, our new framework can simultaneously protect node feature privacy and edge privacy, and can seamlessly incorporate with any GNN with privacy-utility guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmarking datasets show that Solitude can retain the generalization capability of the learned GNN while preserving the users’ data privacy under given privacy budgets.}

	abstract = {Deep learning-based face recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the robustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However, the generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice, they are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models are fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A straightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that they can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a plug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation (PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial defense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have different influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace, called the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts on the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates the immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting them to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen adversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of adversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed method can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional training, indicating that it can be easily generalized to existing face recognition systems.}

	abstract = {Due to the diversity of attack materials, fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is thus important to propose effective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit poor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a novel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by handling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The proposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the importance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and “noise” channels. Then, the propagation of “noise” channels is suppressed in the feature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is designed to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution of live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more disperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that the proposed CFD-PAD can achieve 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and a 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0% (TDR@FDR=1%). Also, the proposed method markedly outperforms the best single-model-based methods in terms of ACE (2.53% vs. 4.56%) and TDR@FDR=1%(93.83% vs. 73.32%), which demonstrates its effectiveness. Although we have achieved a comparable result with the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based methods, there still is an increase in TDR@FDR=1% from 91.19% to 93.83%. In addition, the proposed model is simpler, lighter and more efficient and has achieved a 74.76% reduction in computation time compared with the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based method.}

Model transfer learning, compression and retraining are commonly used by pirates to evade detection or even redeploy the pirated models for new applications without compromising performance. This paper presents a novel non-intrusive DNN IP fingerprinting method that can detect pirated models and provide a non-repudiable and irrevocable ownership proof simultaneously. The fingerprint is derived from projecting a subset of front-layer weights onto a model owner identity defined random space to enable a distinguisher to differentiate pirated models that are used in the same application or retrained for a different task from originally designed DNN models. The proposed method generates compact and irrevocable fingerprints against model IP misappropriation and ownership fraud. It requires no retraining and makes no modification to the original model. The proposed fingerprinting method is evaluated on nine original DNN models trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-10. It is demonstrated to have the highest discriminative power among existing fingerprinting methods in detecting pirated models deployed for the same and different applications, and fraudulent model IP ownership claims.}

In this work, we propose a novel permissioned consensus protocol, named ACCORD, a multi-leader (quorum-based) protocol that achieves fork-resistance, robustness, and scalability. To achieve this, ACCORD consists of three distinct components: 1) an asynchronous quorum selection procedure to designate the creators of future blocks; 2) a block creation protocol run by the quorum to prevent omissions in the presence of honest quorum members; and 3) a decentralized arbitration protocol to ensure consensus by voting. Additionally, we implemented the protocol and conducted experiments to demonstrate scalability, robustness, and fairness.}

	abstract = {Recently, face manipulation techniques have caused increasing trust concerns in our society. Although current face manipulation detection methods achieve impressive performance regarding intra-dataset evaluation, they are struggling to improve the generalization and robustness ability. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hierarchical Frequency-assisted Interactive Networks (HFI-Net) to explore comprehensive frequency-related forgery cues for face manipulation detection. At first, we formulate HFI-Net as a dual-branch network to take full advantage of both CNN and transformer for capturing local details and global context information, respectively. Considering the forged faces are easy to show flaws in the frequency domain, a novel Frequency-based Feature Refinement (FFR) module is proposed to learn frequency-based attention from RGB features. FFR module emphasizes forgery cues and suppresses the pristine semantics information by keeping middle-high frequency features while discarding the low-frequency ones. Based on FFR, we further develop a co- sharing Global-Local Interaction (GLI) module to conduct frequency-assisted interactions while capturing complementarity among dual branches. Lastly, we further implement the GLI module in each stage of the network to effectively explore multi-level frequency artifacts. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks including FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DeepFake-TIMIT, DFDC, UADFV, and DeeperForensics-1.0, which shows that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially in unseen datasets, manipulations, and perturbations evaluation.}

	abstract = {Up to now, most existing steganalytic methods were designed for grayscale images, and are not suitable for the color images that are widely used in social networks. In this paper, we design a universal color image steganalysis network (called UCNet) for the spatial and JPEG domains. The proposed method includes preprocessing, convolutional, and classification modules. To preserve the steganalytic features in each color channel, the preprocessing module first separates the input image into three channels based on the corresponding embedding spaces (i.e., RGB in the spatial domain, and YCbCr in the JPEG domain), and then extracts the image residuals with 62 fixed high-pass filters. Finally, all truncated residuals are concatenated for subsequent analysis, rather than adding them together in the first layer as in existing CNN-based steganalyzers. To accelerate network convergence and effectively reduce the number of parameters, the convolutional module contains three carefully designed types of layers with different shortcut connections and group convolution structures, to further learn the high-level steganalytic features. In the classification module, we employ global average pooling and a fully connected layer for classification. We conduct extensive experiments on ALASKA II to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results that are comparable with other modern CNN-based steganalyzers (e.g., SRNet and LC-Net) in both the spatial and JPEG domains, with relatively few memory requirements and short training times. Furthermore, we also provide some necessary descriptions and carry out numerous ablation experiments to verify the rationality of the network design.}

	abstract = {We study the symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) problem under arbitrary collusion and eavesdropping patterns for replicated databases. We find its capacity, which is the same as the capacity of the original SPIR problem with the number of servers\nN\nreplaced by a number\nF\n∗\n. The number\nF\n∗\nis the optimal solution to a linear programming problem, and it is a function of the joint pattern, which is the union of the collusion and eavesdropping pattern. This is the first result that shows how two arbitrary patterns collectively affect the capacity of the SPIR problem. We draw the conclusion that for SPIR problems, the collusion and eavesdropping constraints are interchangeable in terms of capacity, i.e., the two patterns play the same role in the SPIR problem and the capacity remains unchanged if we exchange the colluding and eavesdropping patterns. As corollaries of our result, the capacity of the SPIR problem under arbitrary collusion patterns, and the capacity of the PIR problem where each colluding set is included in some eavesdropping set, are also found. Some extensions with restrictions to finite message lengths are provided, and in this case, upper and lower bounds on the capacity are given. The lower bound is described with a solution to an integer linear programming problem.}

	abstract = {Anomaly events indicating the unhealthy status of the computer system are recorded in the system log (Syslog). Therefore, Syslog-based anomaly event detection is crucial for diagnosing system issues and problems. However, existing log-based anomaly detection approaches use raw and unstructured log entries independently and incompletely , i.e., without considering the context of each event and event metadata in the logs. They employ incomplete representation of unstructured log data, limiting the deep learning model’s capacity in the early stage, which tends to omit anomaly events and cause false alarms. In this work, we propose DeepSyslog, which represents Syslog with the context of log events and event metadata in the logs. Inspired by the sequence nature of the log stream, we employ unsupervised sentence embedding to extract the semantic and context information hidden in the log stream, rather than word embedding or one-hot embedding, which only capture the similarities between log words. The sentence embedding is further integrated with event metadata to form complete representations of Syslog, which can distinguish the anomaly caused by the correlated log entries and exceptional event metadata in the log. The simulation results on widely used log datasets show that DeepSyslog achieves high performance compared with the existing log-based anomaly event detection approaches.}

	abstract = {Low-resolution (LR) face recognition (LRFR) tackles tiny face images detected from real-world surveillance camera footage, which are unconstrained and generally poor in quality. Owing to the absence of a million-scale labeled LR face dataset, identity-invariant data augmentation (DA) transformations such as flipping, rotation, rescaling, etc., are applied to inflate the effective training examples with respect to the source identities for representation learning. Unfortunately, the identity-invariant property incurs additional intra-class disparity that impairs generalization performance. In this paper, we put forward a new means of DA strategy, termed identity-extended DA, that satisfies both affinity and diversity requirements essential to DA. We instantiate an implicit identity-extended augmentation network, or simply IDEA-Net, to realize the proposed identity-extended DA for LRFR. More specifically, training an IDEA-Net instance augments the small-scale LR (query) face dataset with identity-extended (auxiliary) face examples implicitly in the representation space. We also introduce a calibrator to regulate the disordered representation space by refining the intra-class compactness and the inter-class separation. This diminishes the distribution shift between the original and the augmented examples (affinity) and increases the learning complexity (diversity). We substantiate that IDEA-Net renders a high affinity and diversity representation space. On the other hand, our experimental results on three real-world LR face datasets demonstrate that IDEA-Nets outperform the baselines and other counterparts trained without leveraging the identity-extended examples for LRFR.}

	abstract = {Currently, available contactless continuous authentication (CA) techniques depend on physiological biometrics to identify individuals at long intervals through complex feature extraction, resulting in poor accuracy, high computation costs, and security vacuums during lengthy intervals. To address these issues, we propose WiPT, a WiFi-based contactless CA system that utilizes contextual features and behavioral biometrics to optimize contactless CA technology. Specifically, we designed a low-computation two-step user state detection (TUSD) mechanism that continuously monitors user states in real-time. It locks the system when the registered user leaves and allows user authentication only when the departing user returns. Therefore, it eliminates pointless periodic re-authentication and results in considerably shorter monitoring intervals while significantly reducing computation. Subsequently, benefiting from contextual features, WiPT can identify individuals using more detectable behavioral biometrics. We built a one-class classification model based on the Convolutional Autoencoder to automatically extract rich representations of WiFi signals associated with postural transition movements, resulting in lower authentication delay, higher accuracy, and anti-interference. WiPT was implemented by the widely available 802.11n devices and has been extensively evaluated with typical sit-to-stand postural transitions. WiPT achieves an average accuracy of 96.63% in authentication and 99.78% in defense across 30 subjects with an authentication delay of 5.59 milliseconds and a monitoring interval of 2 seconds. They are 4.87% and 5.03% more accurate and dozens of times less time-consuming than existing WiFi-based CA solutions.}

	abstract = {Typical deep neural network (DNN) backdoor attacks are based on triggers embedded in inputs. Existing imperceptible triggers are computationally expensive or low in attack success. In this paper, we propose a new backdoor trigger, which is easy to generate, imperceptible, and highly effective. The new trigger is a uniformly randomly generated three-dimensional (3D) binary pattern that can be horizontally and/or vertically repeated and mirrored and superposed onto three-channel images for training a backdoored DNN model. Dispersed throughout an image, the new trigger produces weak perturbation to individual pixels, but collectively holds a strong recognizable pattern to train and activate the backdoor of the DNN. We also analytically reveal that the trigger is increasingly effective with the improving resolution of the images. Experiments are conducted using the ResNet-18 and MLP models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and BTSR datasets. In terms of imperceptibility, the new trigger outperforms existing triggers, such as BadNets, Trojaned NN, and Hidden Backdoor, by over an order of magnitude. The new trigger achieves an almost 100% attack success rate, only reduces the classification accuracy by less than 0.7%–2.4%, and invalidates the state-of-the-art defense techniques.}

Specifically, in the proposed model, there is a discrete memoryless channel W_{1}\\!: \\! \\mathscr {X}\\!\\!\\rightarrow \\!\\!{ \\mathscr {Y}}\nbetween transmitter Alice and receiver Bob, while an attacker Oscar is connected with Alice via discrete memoryless channel W_{2}\\!:\\! \\mathscr {X}\\!\\rightarrow \\! { \\mathscr {Z}}\n. Alice encodes message M\nto codeword (\\!S,X^{n}\\!)\n, using an encoding function with secret key K\n. Then, S\nis sent to Bob over a one-way noiseless channel (fully controlled by Oscar), and X^{n}\nis sent over the wiretap channel, say {X}\\!\\rightarrow \\!{(Y,Z)}\n. Building on this model, a new message authentication scheme is proposed. The scheme incorporates a secure channel coding, which uses random coding techniques to detect man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The authentication channel capacity is studied in a specific channel model when W_{2}\nis not less noisy than W_{1}\n. We theoretically demonstrate that the authentication channel capacity is much larger than the secrecy capacity, since Bob does not need to recover information transmitted over the noisy channel.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the secrecy performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled visible light communication (VLC) broadcast channels in the presence of an active eavesdropper (Eve). The considered VLC system consists of multiple separately distributed light-emitting diodes arrays and multiple randomly located users (UEs) in an indoor room. User clustering is conducted to reduce the implementation complexity of successive interference cancellations. Two cooperative precoding strategies based on zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) are designed using the effective channel of each cluster. Based on each precoding strategy, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is developed to obtain the near-optimal power allocation (PA) to strengthen UEs’ confidential transmission and degrade Eve’s reception under minimum secrecy rate requirement, peak amplitude, non-negativity, and power constraints. To tackle the challenging non-convex problem for each precoding strategy, equivalent transformations and arithmetic-geometric mean approximation are conducted to convert the original problem into a series of geometric programming (GP) problems. Based on the reformulated problems, iterative algorithms are proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions by solving the GP problems through successive convex approximations. The convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms are studied. Simulation results show that the sum security performance of the proposed PA approach outperforms conventional PA approaches in both ZF-based and MRT-based precoder schemes. The effectiveness of applying NOMA compared with the orthogonal multiple access-based scheme is also validated for the proposed system.}

However, it is difficult to directly apply the supervised model to arbitrary unseen domains due to the domain gap between the available source domains and unseen target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel label distribution learning (LDL) method to address generalizable multi-source person Re-ID task ( i.e. , there are multiple available source domains, and the testing domain is unseen during training), which aims to explore the relation of different classes and mitigate the domain-shift across different domains so as to improve the discrimination of the model and learn the domain-invariant feature, simultaneously. Specifically, during the training process, we produce the label distribution via the online manner to mine the relation information of different classes, thus it is beneficial for extracting the discriminative feature. Besides, for the label distribution of each class, we further revise it to give more and equal attention to the other domains that the class does not belong to, which can effectively reduce the domain gap across different domains and obtain the domain-invariant feature. Furthermore, we also give the theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with the domain-shift issue. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, further analysis also reveals the superiority of the proposed method.}

However, existing EMB models have yet to demonstrate levels of performance that would be acceptable for real-world use. The present study proposes an improved methodology for EMB with the goal of satisfying the FIDO Biometrics Requirements’ recommendation of 5% false rejection rate at 1-in-10,000 false acceptance rate. A DenseNet-based convolutional neural network is proposed that is memory-efficient, relatively quick to train, and has only ~123K learnable parameters. The model is trained over an array of different eye-tracking tasks to improve the generalizability of learned features. Authentication performance is evaluated on a held-out set of up to 59 individuals across different eye-tracking tasks, test-retest intervals, and with increasing amounts of data available for enrollment and authentication. The impact of degraded sampling rates and spatial precision on authentication performance is also briefly explored to set the stage for future research targeting modern VR/AR devices. The proposed technique not only outperforms the previous state of the art but is also the first to approach a level of authentication performance that would be acceptable for real-world use.}

Different from conventional covert communications with equiprobable constellations modulation, we propose non-equiprobable constellations modulation schemes to further enhance the covert rate. Specifically, we derive covert rate expressions for practical discrete constellation inputs for the first time. Then, we study the covert rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the constellation distribution and power allocation. In particular, an approximate gradient descent method is proposed for obtaining the optimal probabilistic constellation shaping. To strike a balance between the computational complexity and the transmission performance, we further develop a framework that maximizes a lower bound on the achievable rate where the optimal probabilistic constellation shaping problem can be solved efficiently using the Frank-Wolfe method. Extensive numerical results show that the optimized probabilistic constellation shaping strategies provide significant gains in the achievable covert rate over the state-of-the-art schemes.}

However, the cloud is also notoriously subject to a wide attack surface, making it an imperative need to embed security in the cloud-backed OSN service from the very beginning. In light of this, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate PeGraph, the first system simultaneously allowing private, efficient, and rich queries over encrypted social graphs. PeGraph is aimed at safeguarding the confidentiality of the social graph at the cloud, while preserving the functionality of social search, a key enabler for quality OSN services like friend discovery and user targeting. PeGraph is built from a delicate synergy of insights from social graph modelling and lightweight cryptography such as searchable encryption and additive secret sharing, supporting rich social search queries like exact queries, fuzzy queries, and mixed queries. PeGraph also allows the cloud to obliviously render the encrypted social search results in a ranked order according to their importance, as per users’ preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PeGraph can securely process a wide range of practical social search queries within 1 second, over a real-world social graph consisting of millions of entities.}

Although existing rPPG-based solutions exhibit strong performance in experiments, the required observation time is too long (10-12 seconds) to be user-friendly in real applications such as E-payment and smartphone unlock. To shorten the observation time (within 1-second), we propose a fast rPPG-based 3D mask presentation attack detection (PAD) method by analyzing the similarity of rPPG signals in the time domain. In particular, based on facial and background local rPPG signals, we design a set of temporal similarity features to investigate the robust properties of rPPG shape and phase. Following the same direction, we refine the traditional rPPG extractor into a learnable network to cooperate with our TSrPPG feature for better robustness. An effective but lightweight spatiotemporal convolution network is constructed with a self-supervised learning strategy, aiming at enhancing the consistency of genuine facial rPPG signals and reducing the correlation of rPPG signals on masked faces. Extensive experiments are conducted on 3DMAD, HKBU-MARs V1+ and V2+, and CSMAD, which totally involve 18772 short-term video slots with a large number of real-world variations, in terms of mask type, mask transmittance, lighting condition, recording device, resolution of facial region, and compression configuration. Our proposed method persists the good performance of rPPG-based solution with only 1-second observation and outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on discriminability and generalizability. Evaluations on prints attack, display attack, and disguise attacks with transparent masks, make-up and tattoo further exhibit its potential on handling a wider variety of attacks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the length of observation time issue of rPPG-based 3D mask PAD.}

	abstract = {We introduce the use of video coding settings for source identification and propose a new approach that incorporates encoding and encapsulation aspects of a video. To this end, a joint representation of the overall file metadata is developed and used in conjunction with a two-level hierarchical classification method. At the first level, our method groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91% is achieved in correctly identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to an improvement of 6.5% over the conventional approach based on video file encapsulation characteristics. Analysis performed on a large, unlabeled video set also confirmed the aptness of our approach. To further demonstrate the versatility of encoding parameters, we consider attribution of partial video files where file metadata is not available. Our results show that, even in this limited setting that is intrinsic to forensic file recovery, an identification accuracy of 57% can be achieved through the use of a subset of encoding parameters estimated from coded video data.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion attacks are a known threat. To detect such attacks, network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have been developed and deployed. These systems apply machine learning models to high-dimensional vectors of features extracted from network traffic to detect intrusions. Advances in NIDSs have made it challenging for attackers, who must execute attacks without being detected by these systems. Prior research on bypassing NIDSs has mainly focused on perturbing the features extracted from the attack traffic to fool the detection system, however, this may jeopardize the attack’s functionality. In this work, we present TANTRA, a novel end-to-end Timing-based Adversarial Network Traffic Reshaping Attack that can bypass a variety of NIDSs. Our evasion attack utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network (DNN) which is trained to learn the time differences between the target network’s benign packets. The trained LSTM is used to set the time differences between the malicious traffic packets (attack), without changing their content, such that they will “behave” like benign network traffic and will not be detected as an intrusion. We evaluate TANTRA on eight common intrusion attacks and three state-of-the-art NIDS systems, achieving an average success rate of 99.99% in network intrusion detection system evasion. We also propose a novel mitigation technique to address this new evasion attack.}

	abstract = {2D face presentation attacks are one of the most notorious and pervasive face spoofing types, which have caused pressing security issues to facial authentication systems. While RGB-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models have proven to counter the face spoofing attack effectively, most existing FAS models suffer from the overfitting problem (i.e., lack generalization capability to data collected from an unseen environment). Recently, many models have been devoted to capturing auxiliary information (\ne.g\n., depth and infrared maps) to achieve a more robust face liveness detection performance. However, these methods require expensive sensors and cost extra hardware to capture the specific modality information, limiting their applications in practical scenarios. To tackle these problems, we devise a novel and cost-effective FAS system based on the acoustic modality, named Echo-FAS, which employs the crafted acoustic signal as the probe to perform face liveness detection. We first propose to build a large-scale, high-diversity, and acoustic-based FAS database, Echo-Spoof. Then, based upon Echo-Spoof, we propose designing a novel two-branch framework that combines the global and local frequency clues of input signals to distinguish inputs, live vs. spoofing faces accurately. The devised Echo-FAS comprises the following three merits: (1) It only needs one available speaker and microphone as sensors while not requiring any expensive hardware; (2) It can successfully capture the 3D geometrical information of input queries and achieve a remarkable face anti-spoofing performance; and (3) It can be handily allied with other RGB-based FAS models to mitigate the overfitting problem in the RGB modality and make the FAS model more accurate and robust. Our proposed Echo-FAS provides new insights regarding the development of FAS systems for mobile devices.}

This paper proposes a novel detector for stealthy attacks in distributed consensus-based filtering, which has fewer objects to detect and thus can reduce the time consumption of the detector. Based on the proposed detector, we can analyze the estimated performance of the distributed estimator under a stealthy attack. The purpose of this study is to analyze the properties and performance of the estimator equipped with the proposed detector depending on the adversary’s available resources. First, we study the sufficient condition for distributed state estimation to be resilient based on the assumption that the adversary has sufficient resources. With limited adversary resources, the optimal Kalman gain can be obtained by minimizing state estimation error covariance. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is presented to guarantee the convergence of the estimation error covariance in the estimator equipped with the proposed detector. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effect of the detector on the distributed estimator.}

	abstract = {Quantum blockchain is expected to offer an alternative to classical blockchain to resist malicious attacks laughed by future quantum computers. Although a few quantum blockchain schemes have been constructed, their efficiency is low and unable to meet application requirements due to the fact that they lack of a suitable consensus mechanism. To tackle this issue, a consensus mechanism called quantum delegated proof of stake (QDPoS) is constructed by using quantum voting to provide fast decentralization for the quantum blockchain scheme at first. Then an efficient scheme is proposed for quantum blockchain based on QDPoS, where the classical information is initialized as a part of each single quantum state and these quantum states are entangled to form the chain. Compared with previous methods, the designed quantum blockchain scheme is more complete and carried out with higher efficiency, which greatly contributes to better adapting to the challenges of the quantum era.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a convincingly secure transmission framework under an allowable outage probability for practical finite-alphabet inputs, where a full-duplex receiver (Bob) is taken into account to emit the artificial noise for deteriorating the eavesdropper’s decoding performance. We develop a secure-reliable mechanism to take the place of prior secrecy rate (SR) maximization strategy, where a closed form expression is invoked for substituting the non-closed SR expression upon exploiting the multi-exponential decay fitting approach. Hence, the intractable expectation operation over a large number of noise samples is circumvented. Moreover, a pair of critical probabilities of the reliable transmission and secure outage are first analyzed, and then a low-complexity optimization scheme is formulated. Apart from designing the transmission scheme for classically secure networks consisting of a transmitter, Bob and an eavesdropper, we further carry out an investigation on conceiving a secure-reliable strategy against multiple Eves for improving the system’s extensibility. To this end, analytical expressions of both the reliability outage and secrecy outage probabilities for multiple-Eve scenarios are also derived. Furthermore, a pragmatic iterative solution is conceived for addressing the corresponding max-min optimization problem. Finally, the simulation results validate the significance of our considered secure-reliable transmission in terms of the average SR performance attained.}

	abstract = {Logic locking is a holistic countermeasure that protects an integrated circuit (IC) from hardware-focused threats such as piracy of design intellectual property and unauthorized overproduction throughout the globalized IC supply chain. Out of the several techniques proposed by the hardware security community, provably-secure logic locking (PSLL) has acquired a foothold due to its algorithmic and provable-security guarantees. However, the security of these techniques are regularly questioned by attackers that exploit the vulnerabilities arising from the underlying hardware implementation. Unfortunately, such attacks (i) are predominantly specific to locking techniques and (ii) lack generality and scalability. This leads to a plethora of attacks and researchers, especially defenders, find it challenging to ascertain the security of newly developed PSLL techniques. Additionally, there is no public repository of locked circuits that attackers can use to benchmark (and compare) their developed attacks. Driven by these challenges, we aim to develop a generalized attack that can recover the secret key across a breadth of PSLL techniques. To that end, we first categorize the existing PSLL techniques into two generic categories. Then, we extract functional and structural properties depending on the underlying hardware construction of the PSLL techniques and develop two attacks based on the concepts of VLSI testing and Boolean transformations. We evaluate our attacks on 30,000 locked circuits across 14 PSLL techniques, including nine unbroken techniques. Our attacks successfully recover the secret key (100% accuracy) for all the considered techniques. Further, our experimentation across different (i) technology libraries, (ii) commercial and academic synthesis tools, and (iii) logic optimization settings provide several interesting insights. For instance, our attacks can recover the secret key by only using the locked circuit when an academic synthesis tool is used. Additionally, designers can use our attacks as a verification tool to ascertain the lower-bound security achieved by hardware implementations. Finally, we release our artifacts, which could help foster the development of future attacks and defenses in the PSLL domain.}

	abstract = {The flow of data across nodes has become the dominant feature of data sharing in distributed environments with increasingly blurred boundaries, where it is crucial to maintain data access dynamic, trusted, and efficient. However, traditional centralized access control models are not only difficult to apply in distributed environments but also ignore trusted verification of authorized entities. What’s worse, existing access control models rarely consider themselves security, lack independence, at a high risk of being bypassed or tampered with. Thus, we propose in this paper a distributed, dynamic, and trusted access control model, DDTAC-BSS, where the standard Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) architecture is modified and extended. To reduce the attack surface, we separate policy enforcement point (PEP) from other core components, they are located in the node system and access control system, respectively. Then, the access control entry point (ACEP) is added as the only interface for the node system to interact with the access control system. Subsequently, the model introduces the entity trusted assessment mechanism to improve the trustworthiness of access control services. Driven by the dynamic attributes, our model can achieve dynamic trusted authorization and fine-grained access control. Moreover, we implement a lightweight, independent, and distributed security subsystem to achieve unified management of policies and decision-making autonomy by message-driven. By considering the independence of the security subsystem, a trusted operating environment is built based on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to ensure the security of the access control mechanism itself. The security of our model is proved rigorously based on the non-interference theory. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons have demonstrated the superior functionality, comparable performance, and strong security of our model.}

	abstract = {Although existing domain-adaptive person re-identification (re-ID) methods have achieved competitive per- formance, most of them highly rely on the reliability of pseudo-label prediction, which seriously limits their applicability as noisy labels cannot be avoided. This paper designs a Transformer framework based on body part-level domain alignment to solve the above-mentioned issues in domain-adaptive person re-ID. Different parts of the human body (such as head, torso, and legs) have different structures and shapes. Therefore, they usually exhibit different characteristics. The proposed method makes full use of the dissimilarity between different human body parts. Specifically, the local features from the same body part are aggregated by the Transformer to obtain the corresponding class token, which is used as the global representation of this body part. Additionally, a Transformer layer-embedded adversarial learning strategy is designed. This strategy can simultaneously achieve domain alignment and classification of the class token for each human body part in both target and source domains by an integrated discriminator, thereby realizing domain alignment at human body part level. Compared with existing domain-level and identity-level alignment methods, the proposed method has a stronger fine-grained domain alignment capability. Therefore, the information loss or distortion that may occur in the feature alignment process can be effectively alleviated. The proposed method does not need to predict pseudo labels of any target sample, so the negative impact caused by unreliable pseudo labels on re-ID performance can be effectively avoided. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves better performance on the datasets that are in line with real-world scene settings.}

Even under the worst assumption, the adversary only needs to master more than 19.6% of the total mining power to increase the revenue, and can launch a 51% attack with much less than 50%. In addition, we show that honest miners may make decisions based on the overall or current utility, and choosing the current utility is more beneficial to the adversary.}

	abstract = {As a promising candidate to complement traditional biometric modalities, brain biometrics using electroencephalography (EEG) data has received a widespread attention in recent years. However, compared with existing biometrics such as fingerprints and face recognition, research on EEG biometrics is still in its infant stage. Most of the studies focus on either designing signal elicitation protocols from the perspective of neuroscience or developing feature extraction and classification algorithms from the viewpoint of machine learning. These studies have laid the ground for the feasibility of using EEG as a biometric verification modality, but they have also raised security and privacy concerns as EEG data contains sensitive information. Existing research has used hash functions and cryptographic schemes to protect EEG data, but they do not provide functions for revoking compromised templates as in cancellable template design. This paper proposes the first cancellable EEG template design for privacy-preserving EEG-based verification systems, which can protect raw EEG signals containing sensitive privacy information (e.g., identity, health and cognitive status). A novel cancellable EEG template is developed based on EEG features extracted by a deep learning model and a non-invertible transform. The proposed transformation provides cancellable templates, while taking advantage of EEG elicitation protocol fusion to enhance biometric performance. The proposed verification system offers superior performance than the state-of-the-art, while protecting raw EEG data. Furthermore, we analyze the system’s capacity for resisting multiple attacks, and discuss some overlooked but critical issues and possible pitfalls involving hill-climbing attacks, second attacks, and classification-based verification systems.}

	abstract = {These days, a lot of videos are uploaded onto web-based video sharing services such as YouTube. These videos can be freely accessed from all over the world. On the other hand, they often contain the appearance of walking private people, which could be identified by silhouette-based gait recognition techniques rapidly developed in recent years. This causes a serious privacy issue. To avoid it, this paper proposes a method for anonymizing the appearance of walking people, namely human gait, in video. In the proposed method, we first crop human regions from all frames in an input video and binarize them to get their silhouettes. Next, we slightly deform the silhouettes from the aspects of static body shape and dynamic walking rhythm so that the person in the input video cannot be correctly identified by gait recognition techniques. After that, the textures of the original human regions are transferred onto the deformed silhouettes. We achieve this by a displacement field-based approach, which is training-free and thus robust to a variety of clothes. Finally, the anonymized human regions with the transferred textures are filled back into the input video. In the results of our experiments, we successfully degraded the accuracy of CNN-based gait recognition systems from 100% to 1.57% in the lowest case without yielding serious distortion in the appearance of the human regions, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {A recent trend in multi-party computation is to achieve cryptographic fairness via monetary penalties, i.e. each honest player either obtains the output or receives a compensation in the form of a cryptocurrency. We pioneer another type of fairness, financial fairness, that is closer to the real-world valuation of financial transactions. Intuitively, a penalty protocol is financially fair if the net present cost of participation (the total value of cash inflows less cash outflows, weighted by the relative discount rate) is the same for all honest participants, even when some parties cheat. We formally define the notion, show several impossibility results based on game theory, and analyze the practical effects of (lack of) financial fairness if one was to run the protocols for real on Bitcoin using Bloomberg’s dark pool trading. For example, we show that the ladder protocol (CRYPTO’14), and its variants (CCS’15 and CCS’16), fail to achieve financial fairness both in theory and in practice, while the penalty protocols of Kumaresan and Bentov (CCS’14) and Baum, David and Dowsley (FC’20) are financially fair.}

	abstract = {The NIST standardization process for post-quantum cryptography has been drawing the attention of researchers to the submitted candidates. One direction of research consists in implementing those candidates on embedded systems and that exposes them to physical attacks in return. The Classic McEliece cryptosystem, which is among the four finalists of round 3 in the Key Encapsulation Mechanism category, builds its security on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem, which is a classic hard problem in code-based cryptography. This cryptosystem was recently targeted by a laser fault injection attack leading to message recovery. Regrettably, the attack setting is very restrictive and it does not tolerate any error in the faulty syndrome. Moreover, it depends on the very strong attacker model of laser fault injection, and does not apply to optimised implementations of the algorithm that make optimal usage of the machine words capacity. In this article, we propose a to change the angle and perform a message-recovery attack that relies on side-channel information only. We improve on the previously published work in several key aspects. First, we show that side-channel information, obtained with power consumption analysis, is sufficient to obtain an integer syndrome, as required by the attack framework. This is done by leveraging classic machine learning techniques that recover the Hamming weight information very accurately. Second, we put forward a computationally-efficient method, based on a simple dot product and information-set decoding algorithms, to recover the message from the, possibly inaccurate, recovered integer syndrome. Finally, we present a masking countermeasure against the proposed attack.}

The big gap between the sketch domain and RGB domain makes Sketch Re-id challenging. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a new framework to obtain domain-invariant features, which uses CNN as the backbone. To make the model focus more on the regions related to the sketch image in the RGB photo, we propose a novel cross-domain attention (CDA) mechanism. It uses different ways of splitting feature maps in its two branches and calculates the relationship between different parts in the sketch images and RGB photos. Moreover, we designed the cross-domain center loss (CDC), which breaks through the limitations that datasets need to be in the same domain in the traditional center loss. It effectively reduces the gap between two domains and makes the features with the same ID closer. The experiment is performed on the Sketch Re-id dataset. Each person has one sketch image and two RGB photos. To evaluate the generalization, we also experimented on two popular sketch-photo face datasets. The result in the Sketch Re-id dataset shows the model performs 3.7% higher than the previous methods. And the result in the CUHK student dataset performs 0.38% higher than the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability and tamper-proof, which creates a reliable decentralized trust mechanism, further accelerating the development of blockchain finance. However, the anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting in increasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing fraud on blockchain financial platforms. Thus, financial security has become a top priority in the blockchain ecosystem, calling for effective market regulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts from a graph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural network framework named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of accounts and further achieve account de-anonymization. Specifically, we first construct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using raw Ethereum data. Then we design a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone of our framework, which can effectively characterize the node-level account features and subgraph-level behavior patterns. For alleviating account label scarcity, we further introduce contrastive self-supervision mechanism as regularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive experiments on Ethereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in account identification, yielding 1.13%\n∼ 4.93\n% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the effectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding the behavior of known participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that of the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in risk assessment and market regulation.}

The alignment-robust property of the proposed\nR⋅\nHoG enables the fast template comparison which is crucial for an efficient authentication process. Experiments were performed on CASIA-IrisV3-Internal and CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand datasets. The results demonstrate the proposed\nR⋅\nHoG could achieve acceptable verification performance in both datasets. Other than that, the irreversibility and security properties are studied based on major security and privacy attacks in biometric system.

	abstract = {With the advancement of blockchain technology, hundreds of cryptocurrencies have been deployed. The bloom of heterogeneous blockchain platforms brings a new emerging problem: typically, various blockchains are isolated systems, how to securely identify and/or transfer digital properties across blockchains? There are three main kinds of cross-chain approaches: sidechains/relays, notaries, and hashed time-lock contracts. Among them, notary-based cross-chain solutions have the best compatibility and user-friendliness, but they are typically centralized. To resolve this issue, we present Bool Network – an open, distributed, secure cross-chain notary platform powered by MPC-based distributed key management over evolving hidden committees. More specifically, to protect the identities of the committee members, we propose a Ring verifiable random function (Ring VRF) protocol, where the real public key of a VRF instance can be hidden among a ring, which may be of independent interest to other cryptographic protocols. Furthermore, all the key management procedures are executed in the TEE, such as Intel SGX, to ensure the privacy and integrity of partial key components. A prototype of the proposed Bool Network is implemented in Rust language, using Polkadot Substrate.}

	abstract = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) is typically used to achieve ID alignment with protection of IDs in the preparation phase of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). However, existing PSI approaches are limited to protecting IDs that are outside the intersection of participants, and most ignore the sensitivity of intersection for a weak party in an asymmetrical ID alignment. Since the set size of the strong party is much greater than the weak party’s in an asymmetrical federation, and the intersection usually accounts for a substantial part of the weak party set, the weak party’s sensitive sample IDs would be severely compromised through sharing the intersection. To address this issue, we propose Differentially private PSI Cardinality and PSI (DPSI-CA, DPSI) protocols, which protect the intersection cardinality and sensitive IDs inside the intersection for the weak party, respectively. First, DPSI-CA encodes IDs in binary notation, and combines them with the GM encryption, to perform the ID-matchmaking by executing bitwise plaintext XOR. Then, the encrypted matching results are independently perturbed using randomized responses to produce differentially private outputs for PSI-CA, and its unbiased estimate is added to remove the deviation brought by the randomization. Furthermore, DPSI fuses Pseudo-Random Function (PRF)-based zero sharing, garbled Bloom filter, and Oblivious PRF (OPRF)-based shares reconstruction, to successfully reconstruct the shares corresponding to sampled IDs in the intersection. Meanwhile, a randomized response is used to sample the inputs and perturb the outputs of the OPRF-based shares reconstruction, producing a randomly sampled intersection for the weak party and differentially private intersection for the strong party. Finally, the privacy analysis shows that our protocols provide differential privacy for the weak party’s sensitive sample IDs, and extensive experiment results illustrate the feasibility of the asymmetrical ID alignment involving millions of IDs.}

Moreover, for scenarios where the statistics of the dataset is unknown, we propose a new deep learning framework by leveraging a generative adversarial network approach, which allows the user to learn efficient schemes from the data itself. We evaluate the performance of the scheme on a synthetic Gaussian dataset as well as on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and LSUN datasets.

	abstract = {In a wireless sensor network (WSN), provenance, usually considered as the tracebacks of the data packets’ acquisition and transmission, is critical for assessing data trustworthiness. However, the provenance size expands rapidly with increases in the number of packet transmission hops. Among the known provenance schemes, the dictionary based provenance (DP) scheme achieves the highest provenance compression rate up to now. Nevertheless, the average compression rate of the DP scheme decreases drastically when the WSN’s topology is not stable. To address such a disadvantage, in this paper we propose a packet path index differences based provenance (PIDP) scheme. In the PIDP scheme, the backbone paths along the gradient directions of the packet transmissions are built, and then the provenance is encoded by a selected index of a backbone path dictionaries together with a deviation from the backbone path. To further increase the provenance compression rate and decrease the computation complexity at each node, a packet path hash value based provenance (PHP) scheme is proposed as a complementary approach of the PIDP scheme, in which the provenance is encoded as the data source node ID together with a segment of the packet path’s hash value. Both the simulation and experimental results show that our proposed two schemes, the PIDP and the PHP schemes, outperform the DP scheme with respect to both provenance compression rate and energy conservation rate even when a WSN’s topology is not stable.}

Specifically, a compromised manufacturer may issue a backdoored hardware token to a user and later recover the user’s secret, which is well known as backdoor attacks. Additionally, an authentication credential in these schemes consists of two parts: the one is derived from the password, the other one is derived from the hardware token. However, since the two parts are independent of each other, if an adversary can physically access the hardware token of a victim, he is able to break security of these schemes by performing dictionary-guessing attacks (DGA), which is called mislaying-then-DGA. In this paper, we design a non-interactively re-randomizable reverse firewall signature mechanism for securing hardware tokens, such that the user’s secret is well protected even if a backdoor is embedded. We also utilize a servers-aided password-based encryption mechanism to harden hardware tokens, so as to “seamlessly” integrate the two factors into one credential. Based on the above mechanisms, we develop a secure two-factor authentication scheme, dubbed ATTACH. We evaluate ATTACH in terms of security and efficiency to demonstrate it achieves a strong security guarantee with high efficiency.}

	abstract = {In recent years, inner product masking (IPM) has been proposed as a promising code based masking scheme against side-channel attacks. However, most studies mainly focus on leakages in terms of information-theoretic metrics, and simulated experiments utilizing profiled attacks (with known templates). In this paper, we investigate the security of IPM scheme against one typical non-profiled side-channel attack, namely higher-order correlation analysis. We demonstrate that three factors mainly influence the efficiency of higher-order correlation analysis against IPM, and they are the attack order vector, output size of the target function and attack model. In particular, we propose a new method to measure the efficiency of higher-order correlation analyses. Generally speaking, this method is based on the correlation coefficient between leakage expectations with certain shares and sensitive values under the attack model. We validate our method by both simulation-based experiments and practical one with different attack factors. All experiments are running on the IPM in the different noise scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method works well as an indicator for higher-order correlation analyses against IPM.}

	abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has emerged as a popular platform to solve many challenging problems by utilizing users’ wisdom and resources. Due to user diversity, the data provided by different individuals may vary significantly, and thus it is important to analyze data quality during data aggregation. Truth discovery is effective in capturing data quality and obtaining accurate mobile crowdsensing results. Existing works on truth discovery either cannot protect both task privacy and data privacy, or introduce tremendous computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and strong privacy-preserving truth discovery scheme, named EPTD, to protect users’ task privacy and data privacy simultaneously in the truth discovery procedure. In EPTD, we first exploit the randomizable matrix to express users’ tasks and sensory data. Then, based on the matrix computation properties, we design key derivation and (re-)encryption mechanisms to enable truth discovery to be performed in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Through a detailed security analysis, we demonstrate that data privacy and task privacy are well preserved. Extensive experiments based on real-world and simulated mobile crowdsensing applications show EPTD has practical efficiency in terms of computational cost and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {In recent years there has been growing popularity of leveraging cloud computing for storing and querying attributed graphs, which have been widely used to model complex structured data in various applications. Such trend of outsourced graph analytics, however, is accompanied with critical privacy concerns regarding the information-rich and proprietary attributed graph data. In light of this, we design, implement, and evaluate OblivGM, a new system aimed at oblivious graph analytics services outsourced to the cloud. OblivGM focuses on the support for attributed subgraph matching, one popular and fundamental graph query functionality aiming to retrieve from a large attributed graph subgraphs isomorphic to a small query graph. Built from a delicate synergy of insights from attributed graph modelling and advanced lightweight cryptography, OblivGM protects the confidentiality of data content associated with attributed graphs and queries, conceals the connections among vertices in attributed graphs, and hides search access patterns. Meanwhile, OblivGM flexibly supports oblivious evaluation of varying subgraph queries, which may contain equality and/or range predicates. Extensive experiments over a real-world attributed graph dataset demonstrate that while providing strong security guarantees, OblivGM achieves practically affordable performance (with query latency on the order of a few seconds).}

	abstract = {Batteryless devices harvest energy from sporadic ambient sources, enabling a wide range of long-lived, stand-alone, and environmentally-friendly sustainable applications. Software on these devices operates intermittently due to frequent power failures. Each power failure leads the device to lose its computational state that hinders the forward progress of computation and memory consistency. One solution to remedy this situation is to pair programs with checkpoints to save a snapshot of the intermediate program state to non-volatile memory before a power loss. Due to the lack of protection mechanisms in the state-of-the-art intermittent systems, checkpoints can be altered either by programmer errors or deliberately by an attacker. This situation leads to catastrophic effects since the program execution might be corrupted, and in turn, the device might malfunction. In this paper, we propose MPI, a memory protection mechanism for intermittent computing systems. In particular, MPI is a minimal intermittent-compliant trusted computing base acting as a hypervisor that fully manages and protects the underlying memory of a batteryless device. MPI enables a reliable and secure generation and restoration of checkpoints, maintaining their integrity and access control in the presence of remote software-based attacks without trusting the user program or requiring programmer intervention. Notable is that MPI neither requires hardware modifications nor depends on hardware features that might not exist in all batteryless platforms. Our experiments on a real batteryless platform show that MPI provides stronger security guarantees compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparable time and energy overhead.}

	abstract = {Network telescopes or “Darknets” received unsolicited Internet-wide traffic, thus providing a unique window into macroscopic Internet activities associated with malware propagation, denial of service attacks, network reconnaissance, misconfigurations and network outages. Analysis of the resulting data can provide actionable insights to security analysts that can be used to prevent or mitigate cyber-threats. Large network telescopes, however, observe millions of nefarious scanning activities on a daily basis which makes the transformation of the captured information into meaningful threat intelligence challenging. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework for characterizing the structure and temporal evolution of scanning behaviors observed in network telescopes. The proposed framework includes four components. It (i) extracts a rich, high-dimensional representation of scanning profiles composed of features distilled from network telescope data; (ii) learns, in an unsupervised fashion, information-preserving succinct representations of these scanning behaviors using deep representation learning that is amenable to clustering; (iii) performs clustering of the scanner profiles in the resulting latent representation space on daily Darknet data, and (iv) detects temporal changes in scanning behavior using techniques from optimal mass transport. We robustly evaluate the proposed system using both synthetic data and real-world Darknet data. We demonstrate its ability to detect real-world, high-impact cybersecurity incidents such as the onset of the Mirai botnet in late 2016 and several interesting cluster formations in early 2022 (e.g., heavy scanners, evolved Mirai variants, Darknet “backscatter” activities, etc.). Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods showcase that the integration of the proposed features with the deep representation learning scheme leads to better classification performance of Darknet scanners.}

	abstract = {Secure outsourced computation is a key technique for protecting data security and privacy in the cloud. Although fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computations over encrypted data, it suffers from high computation costs in order to support an unlimited number of arithmetic operations. Recently, secure computations based on interactions of multiple computation servers and partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) were proposed in the literature, which enable an unbound number of addition and multiplication operations on encrypted data more efficiently than FHE and do not add any noise to encrypted data; however, these existing solutions are either limited in functionalities (e.g., computation on natural numbers only) or leak information of the underlying data. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper proposes Secure Outsourced Computation on Integers (SOCI) based on PHE and a twin-server architecture. Compared with the existing solutions, SOCI supports computations on encrypted integers (vs. natural numbers) and greatly improves the security and correctness of the computations. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation show that SOCI outperforms existing solutions in computation and communication efficiencies.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage service provides a convenient way for users to store massive data. To guarantee the integrity of the outsourced data, provable data possession (PDP) schemes for multi-copy data and multi-cloud have been proposed respectively. To avoid a single point of failure and to increase the security of the outsourced data, many users store multiple copies on multiple cloud servers. However, few protocols support multi-copy data and multi-cloud at the same time. Considering that three entities (third-party auditor, cloud organizer and cloud storage servers) participate in the auditing process, it is difficult for users to locate the position of the faults, including entity position, file position and data block corruption position, when the auditor reports data corruption. In this paper we propose a certificateless multi-copy public auditing protocol in multi-cloud storage, which supports to locate the faults entities and corrupted data blocks. Specifically, instead of relying on a trusted centralized judgement entity to deal with the faults detection, smart contracts combined with the binary search technique are utilized to help achieve the reliability of faults localization result and the accuracy of the judgement. Additionally, the proposed protocol supports data dynamics update, including data modification, insertion and deletion. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that our protocol is efficient and practical.}

However, in the existing face morphing attack detection (MAD), the deep networks trained by classical score-level losses are weak in characterizing the intrinsic morphing patterns of different MAs, and they also cannot be directly applied to differential MAD scenarios. To this end, this paper presents a method for detecting and locating face MAs by the use of feature-wise supervision. It constructs the fine-grained classification loss on the basis of different morphing patterns, and designs the similarity-based and distance-based differential losses according to the properties of differential MAD scenarios. The experimental results and analysis show that the fine-grained classification loss can locate the local morphed areas after detecting MAs, while the differential losses are able to improve the generalization ability of MAD methods to unseen MAs, and can enhance the robustness of MAD methods to low-resolution and non-frontal probe face images.}

Existing defenses mainly leverage Byzantine-robust federated learning methods or detect malicious clients. However, these defenses do not have provable security guarantees against poisoning attacks and may be vulnerable to more advanced attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap by proposing FLCert, an ensemble federated learning framework, that is provably secure against poisoning attacks with a bounded number of malicious clients. Our key idea is to divide the clients into groups, learn a global model for each group of clients using any existing federated learning method, and take a majority vote among the global models to classify a test input. Specifically, we consider two methods to group the clients and propose two variants of FLCert correspondingly, i.e., FLCert-P that randomly samples clients in each group, and FLCert-D that divides clients to disjoint groups deterministically. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that the label predicted by our FLCert for a test input is provably unaffected by a bounded number of malicious clients, no matter what poisoning attacks they use.}

Deep learning as a powerful modeling method has advanced the research progress of fingerprint recognition, but it still suffers from the lack of labeled data in the scenario of partial fingerprint matching. In this paper, we propose a novel partial fingerprint verification network (PFVNet) based on spatial transformer network (STN) and the local self-attention mechanism. Our model can be trained end-to-end and learn multi-level fingerprint features automatically. To alleviate the data annotation work, the model is trained in a self-supervision and domain adaptation manner with data generated from large fingerprint image matching.

A maximum weighted sum secrecy rate problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the active beamforming (BF) at the base stations and passive BF at the RISs. To handle this non-trivial problem, we adopt the alternating optimization to decouple the original problem into two sub-ones, which are solved using the semidefinite relaxation and continuous convex approximation theory. To decrease the complexity for obtaining overall channel state information (CSI), we extend the proposed framework to the case that only requires part of the RIS’ CSI. This is achieved via deliberately discarding the RIS that has a small contribution to the user’s secrecy rate. Based on this, we formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, and the linear conic relaxation is used to obtained the solutions. Meanwhile, we also study the system performance under the imperfect CSI. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed schemes can obtain a higher secrecy rate than the existing ones.}

We devised two methods to inject the attack signal into audio files to make the acoustic attack more stealthy. The realized attack is non-intrusive and does not require tampering with the ESP hardware device, making attack detection more difficult. We also consider a neural network-based defense strategy and verify its effectiveness.

However, it is known that non-linear deformations in the iris texture, with fibers vanishing/appearing in response to pupil dilation/contraction, often flip the signature coefficients, being the main cause for the increase of false rejections. This paper addresses this problem, describing a customised Deep Learning (DL) framework that: 1) virtually emulates the IrisCode feature encoding phase; while also 2) detects the deformations in the iris texture that may lead to bit flipping, and autonomously adapts the filter configurations for such cases. The proposed DL architecture seamlessly integrates the Gabor kernels that extract the IrisCode and a multi-scale texture analyzer, from where the biometric signatures yield. In this sense, it can be seen as an adaptive encoder that is fully compatible to the IrisCode approach, while increasing the permanence of the signatures. The experiments were conducted in two well known datasets (CASIA-Iris-Lamp and CASIA-Iris-Thousand) and showed a notorious decrease of the mean/standard deviation values of the genuines distribution, at expenses of only a marginal deterioration in the impostors scores. The resulting decision environments consistently reduce the levels of false rejections with respect to the baseline for most operating levels (e.g., over 50% at\n1\ne\n−3\nFAR values).}

	abstract = {Cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) system is becoming a promising architecture in our modern society. However, cloud-based IoT system brings a number of challenges in the security aspect while improving the efficiency of data analytics. Especially, searching on encrypted data is challenging given today’s technology. Thus searchable encryption has emerged as one of the important research fields. Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) provides a simple but useful mechanism to cryptographically protect data while keeping it available for equality test on ciphertexts. However, PKEET schemes in the literature are not suitable for cloud-based IoT system with privacy protection enhancement since the untrustworthy cloud server may be interested in query results by itself and hence reveal the private information of data owner out of the expectation of data user. Even worse, it could launch offline message recovery attack (OMRA) based on the returned query results. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of public key encryption with outsourced equality test (PKE-OET) for adapting to cloud-based IoT environments as well as providing a flexible solution to resist against OMRA without taking any information about entrusted parties as input in encryption. We formally define the security model of PKE-OET against three types of adversary including IND-CCA-I, IND-CCA-II and IND-CCA-III. We present a generic PKE-OET construction using a new variant of smooth projective hash function (SPHF) with a novel Lin-Hom property, which is of independent interest. Then we provide an efficient PKE-OET instantiation from Symmetric eXternal Diffie-Helllman (SXDH) assumption and show its practicality for cloud-based IoT environments through a series of experiments on Cloud Server and Raspberry Pi.}

	abstract = {Trigger-action programming (TAP) is a popular end-user programming framework that can simplify the Internet of Things (IoT) automation with simple trigger-action rules. However, it also introduces new security and safety threats. A lot of advanced techniques have been proposed to address this problem. Rigorously reasoning about the security of a TAP-based IoT system requires a well-defined model and verification method both against rule semantics and physical-world features, e.g., concurrency, rule latency, extended action, tardy attributes, and connection-based rule interactions, which has been missing until now. By analyzing these features, we find 9 new types of rule interaction vulnerabilities and validate them on two commercial IoT platforms. We then present TAPInspector, a novel system to detect these interaction vulnerabilities in concurrent TAP-based IoT systems. It automatically extracts TAP rules from IoT apps, translates them into a hybrid model by model slicing and state compression, and performs semantic analysis and model checking with various safety and liveness properties. Our experiments corroborate that TAPInspector is practical: it identifies 533 violations related to rule interaction from 1108 real-world market IoT apps and is at least 60000 times faster than the baseline without optimization.}

	abstract = {The increasing diversity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) application scenarios and explosive growth of access devices have brought more frequent exchanges of resources between different administrative domains. Cross-domain authentication has become a key to safeguard communication and resource interaction among domains. Traditional centralized authentication schemes present heavy management overhead and trust challenges in cross-domain scenarios. Most of existing studies are incapable of establishing trust relationships between domains deployed with different authentication schemes, rendering such high-cost schemes difficult to be generalized. Further, the cross-domain scenario of IoT also raises additional requirements for device privacy and system overhead. In order to tackle these issues, this paper proposes a complete cross-domain authentication and privacy protection scheme, called CCAP, for the IoT based on consortium blockchain. CCAP achieves cross-domain authentication among the IoT domains which may have different configurations from each other. Further, CCAP can be cost-effectively deployed in resource-limited IoT domains and can offer privacy protection and efficient and secure communication for IoT devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme through experiments in virtual and physical experiment environments as well as comparing and analyzing CCAP with state-of-the-art work.}

Video sharing-based hidden communication can conceal the contact relation between the sender and receiver and achieve the one-to-many delivery of secret messages. However, most video steganographic methods are unable to complete reliable hidden communication on social networks because of lossy video recompression. In this paper, we propose adaptive QIM (Quantization Index Modulation) with minimum embedding cost, which decreases the quantization distortion as much as possible to improve the security performance against steganalysis under the same level of robustness. Furthermore, based on the proposed quantization modulation scheme, we implement two robust steganographic methods in the DWT-SVD domain and the DTCWT-SVD domain. Experimental results show that the overall performance of our proposed modulation scheme outperforms QIM and adaptive QIM. Compared with existing robust video data hiding, two proposed steganographic methods demonstrate superior robustness and security on local lossy channels and social networks.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs), regardless of their impressive performance, are vulnerable to attacks from adversarial inputs and, more recently, Trojans to misguide or hijack the decision of the model. We expose the existence of an intriguing class of spatially bounded, physically realizable, adversarial examples— Universal NaTuralistic adversarial paTches—we call TnTs, by exploring the super set of the spatially bounded adversarial example space and the natural input space within generative adversarial networks. Now, an adversary can arm themselves with a patch that is naturalistic, less malicious-looking, physically realizable, highly effective—achieving high attack success rates, and universal. A TnT is universal because any input image captured with a TnT in the scene will: i) misguide a network (untargeted attack); or ii) force the network to make a malicious decision (targeted attack). Interestingly, now, an adversarial patch attacker has the potential to exert a greater level of control—the ability to choose a location independent, natural-looking patch as a trigger in contrast to being constrained to noisy perturbations—an ability is thus far shown to be only possible with Trojan attack methods needing to interfere with the model building processes to embed a backdoor at the risk discovery; but, still realize a patch deployable in the physical world. Through extensive experiments on the large-scale visual classification task, ImageNet with evaluations across its entire validation set of 50,000 images, we demonstrate the realistic threat from TnTs and the robustness of the attack. We show a generalization of the attack to create patches achieving higher attack success rates than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results show the generalizability of the attack to different visual classification tasks ( CIFAR-10 , GTSRB , PubFig ) and multiple state-of-the-art deep neural networks such as WideResnet50, Inception-V3 and VGG-16.}

	abstract = {Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) comprise nodes characterised by constrained computational power, memory, and energy resources. The LLN nodes empower ubiquitous connections amongst numerous devices (e.g. temperature, humidity, and turbidity sensors, together with motors, valves and other actuators) to sense, control and store properties of their environments. They are often deployed in hostile, unattended, and unfavourable conditions. Securing them often becomes very challenging. The extent of interconnected LLN devices poses a series of routing threats (e.g. wormhole, grayhole, DIO suppression, and increase rank attacks). Consequently, an efficient and effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is of utmost importance in identifying anomalous activities in the IPv6 over Low-powered Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN). This article proposes a robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (ARL) framework to generate efficient IDSs for evolving data environments. The integration of ARL and incremental machine-learning facilitates the generation of resource-efficient and robust IDS detectors. We demonstrate in particular how such an approach, leveraging notions of ‘concept drift’ detection and adaptation, can handle inevitable changes in the environment, giving the IDS best chances of detecting attacks in the current profile. The range of routing attacks considered is the most comprehensive to date. For the first time, Black-box and Grey-box ML-based adversaries aiming to destabilise the 6LoWPAN are distinguished and addressed.}

	abstract = {This paper initiates the study of “Cryptophasia in Hardware” – a phenomenon that allows hardware circuits/devices with no pre-established secret keys to securely exchange secret information over insecure communication networks. The study of cryptophasia is motivated by the need to establish secure communication channels between lightweight resource-constrained devices incapable of securely storing cryptographic keys and/or executing resource-intensive cryptographic protocols. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called Physically Related Functions (PReFs) that can exchange secret information in a secure and authenticated manner over insecure networks. This function can be visualized as an abstraction of Strong Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Strong PUFs have the limitation in communicating between two identical devices, an issue that we address in the definition of PReFs. We describe a formal framework for analyzing the functional and security requirements of PReFs. In this framework, we present a lightweight (in terms of computation cost) yet provably secure authenticated key-exchange protocol that relies only on PReFs and makes no additional assumptions (such as secure storage of cryptographic keys). Finally, we present a proof-of-concept realization of PReFs in hardware over Digilent Cora Z7 – a low-cost development platform (consisting of an ARM Cortex processor and a Xilinx FPGA) that is particularly suitable for real-world IoT applications involving resource-constrained devices. We validate that our realization of PReFs satisfies all the properties warranted by our formal framework. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed protocol by analyzing its performance (in terms of computational and communication latency) over the Digilent Cora Z7 platform.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning techniques have received significant attention in the side-channel community due to their state-of-the-art performance in profiled attacks against embedded devices. Compared with template attacks, deep learning-based attacks can deal with the high dimensionality of trace and misalignment without pre-processing. However, the performance of attacks is very sensitive to the network architecture, especially when considering masking countermeasures. Although previous works have shown the potential of neural networks to break the first-order masking, the inner-working of how the network combines the leakage of mask and masked value is still unclear and could be suboptimal. To reduce this gap, we propose to embed product combination, which has been proved to be the best combination function in noisy situations, into the design of neural networks. To this end, we introduce a bilinear convolutional neural network (in short, B-CNN) for efficient profiled attacks against the widely used masking countermeasure. In order to interpret the inner-working and decision-making of B-CNN, we propose a new visualization tool called layer-wise correlation that can reveal the points of interest and help to understand the combination of leakages. We evaluate our networks on several public datasets, e.g., ASCAD and CHES CTF 2018. The results indicate that B-CNN converges significantly faster than classic CNN models, even using a very limited number of profiling traces (e.g., 8000 profiling traces for the ASCAD dataset). Moreover, our networks perform even systematically better (w.r.t. the number of attack traces) than the current state-of-the-art results on all the investigated datasets.}

In this paper we present the first private end-to-end encryption protocol called the Eddystone-Ephemeral-ID (Eddystone-EID) protocol. This protocol enables connectivity from any beacon to its remote owner, while supporting beacon’s privacy and security, and essentially preserving the beacon’s low power consumption. We describe the Eddystone-EID development goals, discuss the design decisions, show the cryptographic solution, and analyse its privacy, security, and performance. Finally, we present three secure IoT applications built on Eddystone-EID, demonstrating its utility as a security and privacy infrastructure in the IoT domain. Further, Eddystone-EID is a prototypical example of security design for an asymmetric system in which on one side there are small power-deficient elements (the beacons) and on the other side there is a powerful computing engine (a cloud). The crux of the design strategy is based on: (1) transferring work from the beacon to the cloud, and then (2) building a trade-off between cloud online work against cloud offline work, in order to enable fast real-time reaction of the cloud. These two principles seem to be generic and can be used for other problems in the IoT domain.}

	abstract = {Source location Privacy (SLP) is an important property for security critical applications deployed over a wireless sensor network. This property specifies that the location of the source of messages needs to be kept secret from an eavesdropping adversary that is able to move around the network. Most previous work on SLP has focused on developing protocols to enhance the SLP imparted to the network under various attacker models and other conditions. Other works have focused on analysing the level of SLP being imparted by a specific protocol. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a routing matrix which captures when messages are first received. We then introduce a novel approach where an optimal SLP routing matrix is derived. In this approach, the attacker’s movement is modelled as a Markov chain where measures of conditional entropy and divergence are used to compare routing matrices and quantify if they provide high levels of SLP. We propose the notion of a properly competing paths that causes an attacker to divert when moving towards the source. This concept provides the basis for developing a perturbation model, similar to those used in privacy-preserving data mining. We formally prove that properly competing paths are both necessary and sufficient in ensuring the existence of an SLP-aware routing matrix and show their usage in developing an SLP-aware routing matrix. Further, we show how different SLP-aware routing matrices can be obtained through different instantiations of the framework. Those instantiations are obtained based on a notion of information loss achieved through the use of the perturbation model proposed.}

	abstract = {Evaluating the side-channel resistance in practice is a problematic and arduous process. Current certification schemes require to attack the device under test with an ever-growing number of techniques to validate its security. In addition, the success or failure of these techniques strongly depends on the individual implementing them due to the fallible and human intrinsic nature of several steps of this path. To alleviate this problem, we propose a battery of automated (Estimation of Distribution Algorihm(EDA)-based) attacks as a side-channel analysis robustness assessment of an embedded device. To prove our approach, we conduct realistic experiments on two different devices, creating a new dataset (AES_RA) as a part of our contribution. Furthermore, in this context of automation, we propose several novel improvements over current EDA-based attacks, as follows: 1) optimization of the search process by employing two proposed initialization techniques; 2) improvement and analysis of the generalization of the obtained templates; 3) acceleration of the search process by combining EDAs with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The last contribution also serves as an alternative way of selecting optimal principal components automatically. We support our claims with experiments on AES_RA and a public dataset (ASCAD), showing how our, although fully automated, approach can straightforwardly provide state-of-the-art results.}

We also state the modifications in the bounds for global sensitivity and the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added, both before and after aggregation.}

	abstract = {Security threats increase as connectivity among vehicles increases. In particular, a lack of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality makes the controller area network (CAN) protocol, which is used in critical domains such as vehicle body and powertrain, vulnerable to threats. In this paper, we propose methods for CAN security enhancement that use a support vector machine (SVM) and the autocorrelation of the received signal to detect a malicious node. Robustness to temperature variation is also considered because autocorrelation is affected by temperature variation. There are two methods based on the degree of uniformity of the temperature distribution. If the temperature is uniformly distributed over the vehicle and the temperature sensor is embedded in the secure node, the first scheme (temperature measurement system) trains data in each segmented temperature range more precisely using multiple classifiers. If not (i.e., a nonuniform temperature distribution or an absence of a temperature sensor), the alternative scheme (all-temperature training system) trains data in all temperature ranges with a single classifier. The performances of the proposed systems are evaluated on a testbed. The proposed method can operate without modifying the CAN protocol because it is based on the characteristics of the physical layer. In addition, security can be enhanced redundantly by the system running independently without authentication protocols.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel data-driven framework to aid in system state estimation when the power system is under unobservable false data injection attacks. The proposed framework dynamically detects and classifies false data injection attacks. Then, it retrieves the control signal using the acquired information. This process is accomplished in three main modules, with novel designs, for detection, classification, and control signal retrieval. The detection module monitors historical changes in phasor measurements and captures any deviation pattern caused by an attack on a complex plane. This approach can help to reveal characteristics of the attacks including the direction, magnitude, and ratio of the injected false data. Using this information, the signal retrieval module can easily recover the original control signal and remove the injected false data. Further information regarding the attack type can be obtained through the classifier module. The proposed ensemble learner is compatible with harsh learning conditions including the lack of labeled data, concept drift, concept evolution, recurring classes, and independence from external updates. The proposed novel classifier can dynamically learn from data and classify attacks under all these harsh learning conditions. The introduced framework is evaluated w.r.t. real-world data captured from the Central New York Power System. The obtained results indicate the efficacy and stability of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Random number generation is critical to many applications. Gaming, gambling, and particularly cryptography all require random numbers that are uniform and unpredictable. For testing whether supposedly random sources feature particular characteristics commonly found in random sequences, batteries of statistical tests are used. These are fundamental tools in the evaluation of random number generators and form part of the pathway to certification of secure systems implementing them. Although there have been previous studies into this subject (Becker, 2013), RNG manufacturers and vendors continue to use statistical tests known to be of dubious reliability, in their RNG verification processes. Our research shows that FIPS-140-2 cannot identify adversarial biases effectively, even very primitive ones. Concretely, this work illustrates the inability of the FIPS 140 family of tests to detect bias in three obviously flawed PRNGs. Deprecated by official standards, these tests are nevertheless still widely used, for example in hardware-level self-test schemes incorporated into the design of many True RNGs (TRNGs). They are also popular with engineers and cryptographers for quickly assessing the randomness characteristics of security primitives and protocols, and even with manufacturers aiming to market the randomness features of their products to potential customers. In the following, we present three biased-by-design RNGs to show in explicit detail how simple, glaringly obvious biases are not detected by any of the FIPS 140–2 tests. One of these RNGs is backdoored, leaking key material, while others suffer from significantly reduced unpredictability in their output sequences. To make our point even more straightforward, we show how files containing images can also fool the FIPS 140 family of tests. We end with a discussion on the security issues affecting an interesting and active project to create a randomness beacon. Their authors only tested the quality of their randomness with the FIPS 140 family of tests, and we will show how this has led them to produce predictable output that, albeit passing FIPS fails other randomness tests quite catastrophically.}

	abstract = {Over recent years, many vulnerabilities have been exposed in vehicles, whose probability of occurrence will rise in the future due to connectivity and increasing system complexity. Even more serious that the Controller Area Network (CAN), widely used by Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to exchange safety-critical messages within a vehicle, does not provide any security measures. In this context, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have recently been proposed that use time characteristics in the analog transmission signal to identify the sending ECU and detect unauthorized messages. However, realistic application of proposed approaches is not yet tangible, with the full potential of time-based systems yet to be determined. In this elaboration, we therefore establish a foundation by working out robust time characteristics first and analyze root causes for their variation between ECUs. Combining the results with insights from related research, we deduce properties which help to design reliable and feasible IDSs for CAN. Finally, we emphasize these properties by presenting ASSASSIN, an IDS that uses time characteristics to identify the sender of a CAN message and assess authenticity. Achieving an average detection rate of 99.02%, real-time capable classification and an adaptability to temperature fluctuations, we demonstrate the potential of time-based IDSs on a prototype setup and a real vehicle using resource-limited hardware, also contrasting them with well-elaborated voltage-based IDSs.}

	abstract = {Host-based threats such as Program Attack, Malware Implantation, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), are commonly adopted by modern attackers. Recent studies propose leveraging the rich contextual information in data provenance to detect threats in a host. Data provenance is a directed acyclic graph constructed from system audit data. Nodes in a provenance graph represent system entities (e.g.,\nprocesses\nand\nfiles\n) and edges represent system calls in the direction of information flow. However, previous studies, which extract features of the provenance graph, are not sensitive to the small quantity of threat-related entities and thus result in low performance when hunting stealthy threats. We present THREATRACE, an anomaly-based detector that detects host-based threats at system entity level without prior knowledge of attack patterns. We tailor GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to learn every benign entity’s role in a provenance graph. THREATRACE is a real-time system, which is scalable of monitoring a long-term running host and capable of detecting host-based intrusion in their early phase. We evaluate THREATRACE on five public datasets. The results show that THREATRACE outperforms seven state-of-the-art host intrusion detection systems.}

	abstract = {We investigate covert wireless communication in a multi-antenna relay network, where the relay transmits its own covert message to the destination when assisting the source’s information delivery, and the source acts as a warden to detect this covert transmission. Based on whether the channel state information of the relay-destination link is available at the source or not, we propose two relay beamforming schemes, namely random beamforming and maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming schemes, to guarantee the reception reliability at the destination while deliberately introducing uncertainty to the source to degrade its detection. Under the worst-case covert communication scenario where the source is capable of optimizing its detection threshold, analytical expressions for the minimum detection error probability achieved by each of the proposed schemes are derived to evaluate the detection limits of the source. By utilizing the above analytical results as the covertness constraint, an optimization problem of transmit power allocation for each scheme is formulated and solved to maximize the covert rate. The impact of imperfect channel state information on the covert communication performance is also examined. Simulation results are performed to confirm the accuracy of the derived analytical results and quantify the communication covertness enhancement of the proposed schemes. Our results also show that the MRT beamforming scheme offers a higher covert rate than that of the random beamforming scheme, especially when the covertness constraint becomes loose and/or the number of antennas at the relay increases.}

	abstract = {The uncontrollable acquisition process limits the performance of iris recognition. In the acquisition process, various inevitable factors, including eyes, devices, and environment, hinder the iris recognition system from learning a discriminative identity representation. This leads to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we explore uncertain acquisition factors and propose uncertainty embedding (UE) and uncertainty-guided curriculum learning (UGCL) to mitigate the influence of acquisition factors. UE represents an iris image using a probabilistic distribution rather than a deterministic point (binary template or feature vector) that is widely adopted in iris recognition methods. Specifically, UE learns identity and uncertainty features from the input image, and encodes them as two independent components of the distribution, mean and variance. Based on this representation, an input image can be regarded as an instantiated feature sampled from the UE, and we can also generate various virtual features through sampling. UGCL is constructed by imitating the progressive learning process of newborns. Particularly, it selects virtual features to train the model in an easy-to-hard order at different training stages according to their uncertainty. In addition, an instance-level enhancement method is developed by utilizing local and global statistics to mitigate the data uncertainty from image noise and acquisition conditions in the pixel-level space. The experimental results on six benchmark iris datasets verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method on same-sensor and cross-sensor recognition.}

	abstract = {Similarity queries, giving a way to disease diagnosis based on similar patients, have wide applications in eHealthcare and are essentially demanded to be processed under fine-grained access policies due to the high sensitivity of healthcare data. One efficient and flexible way to implement such queries is to outsource healthcare data and the corresponding query services to a powerful cloud. Nevertheless, considering data privacy, healthcare data are usually outsourced in an encrypted form and required to be accessed in a privacy-preserving way. In the past years, many schemes have been proposed for privacy-preserving similarity queries. However, none of them is applicable to achieve data access control and access pattern privacy preservation. Aiming at this challenge, we propose an efficient and access pattern privacy-preserving similarity range query scheme with access control (named EPSim-AC). In our proposed scheme, we first design a novel tree structure, called\nk\n-d-PB tree, to index healthcare data and introduce an efficient\nk\n-d-PB tree based similarity query algorithm with access control. Second, to balance the search efficiency and access pattern privacy of\nk\n-d-PB tree, we also define a weakened access pattern privacy, called\nk\n-d-PB tree’s\nβ\n-access pattern unlinkability. After that, we preserve the privacy of\nk\n-d-PB tree based similarity queries with access control through a symmetric homomorphic encryption scheme and present our detailed EPSim-AC scheme. Finally, we analyze the security of our scheme and also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate that our scheme can guarantee\nk\n-d-PB tree’s\nβ\n-access pattern unlinkability and has high efficiency.}

	abstract = {Distributed key generation (DKG) is widely used in multi-party computation and decentralized applications. DKG has two phases, namely sharing and reconstruction. Most of the prior DKG protocols need at least 2 rounds for the sharing phase, in case some party raises a dispute. The existing 1-round DKG protocol [Fouque et al. , PKC’01], built based on a publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme, assumes a static adversary model and its reconstruction phase requires\nO(\nn\n2\n)\ncommunication complexity. Motivated by the observation that a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme hides secret sharing (SS) in ciphertext, we utilize decentralized CP-ABE to achieve the first adaptively secure 1-round DKG protocol. Firstly, a CP-ABE scheme enables the ciphertexts in DKG to be externally decrypted, making our protocol superior to the PVSS-based DKG protocol in reconstruction. The communication and computation complexities are both lowered to\nO(n)\nthanks to the constant-sized decryption key and the proposed batch decryption. The use of CP-ABE also makes our DKG protocol storage-friendly, i.e., the parties store no ciphertext after the sharing phase. Secondly, we add non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs to make the CP-ABE ciphertext publicly verifiable by leveraging the sigma protocol and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Thirdly, we demonstrate our protocol’s feasibility by presenting a proof-of-concept implementation over Ethereum, which is used as a public channel and a trustworthy computation platform. The implementation is a non-trivial task due to Ethereum’s incompatibility with the bilinear mapping group.}

	abstract = {Efficiently identifying the mated gallery fingerprint of a latent fingerprint in a large database requires a highly accurate and efficient fingerprint matching algorithm. The common strategy to achieve this goal is to combine an efficient indexing algorithm with a slow but accurate matching algorithm. Despite of the importance of latent indexing, it has received far less attention than rolled and plain fingerprint indexing. Due to the small fingerprint area, poor image quality and huge variety in information quantity of latent fingerprints, existing rolled and plain fingerprint indexing approaches cannot be simply migrated to the latent fingerprint indexing. In this paper, we propose (1) a multi-scale fixed-length representation approach for latent fingerprint indexing, and (2) a fingerprint information quantity estimation approach for adaptive candidate list reduction. The representation scheme is designed to deal with small finger area and low image quality of latents. The information quantity of a latent is a predictor of the indexing score of its mated gallery fingerprint and thus can be used to determine a proper threshold for its candidate list. Extensive experimental results on NIST SD27, MOLF, N2N, and Hisign latent fingerprint databases show that the proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art indexing accuracy on latent fingerprints, and significantly improved the efficiency of state-of-the-art latent matching algorithm.}

	abstract = {Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are promising solutions for low-cost device authentication; hence, ignoring the security of PUFs is becoming increasingly difficult. Generally, strong PUFs are vulnerable to classical machine learning (ML) attacks; however, classical ML attacks do not perform well on strong PUFs with complex structures. Side-channel analysis (SCA) hybrid attacks provide efficient approaches to modeling XOR APUF. However, owing to the inadequate exploitation of all available data, recent SCA hybrid attacks may fail on novel PUF designs, such as MPUF and iPUF. Thus, herein, we introduce a method that combines challenge-response pairs with side-channel information to construct challenge-synthetic-feature pairs (CSPs) via feature cross, thereby making it possible to model strong PUFs through multiclass classification. We propose multiclass classification-based SCA hybrid attacks to model strong PUFs with complex structures. When provided with CSPs, the proposed hybrid attacks use a feed-forward neural network with a softmax activation function to build combined models of PUFs. The combined models predict class labels for given challenges and then reveal responses through simple mappings from these labels. Experimental results show that the proposed attacks could model 16-XOR APUF, (128,5)-MPUF, (8,8)-iPUF, and (2,16)-iPUF with accuracies exceeding 94%. Compared with state-of-the-art modeling techniques, the proposed attack has advantages in terms of modeling accuracy, time cost, and the size of required training data.}

In STOP, malicious traffic filtering is viewed as a value-added service and each filter contributor (i.e., AS) can get some benefit from it. This helps ASes to strengthen the willing of defense cooperation. Moreover, we devise a filter recommendation algorithm to maximize the filtering efficiency, with minimum service cost and bandwidth damages. Furthermore, in the face of the strategic threats that aim to paralyze or bypass STOP, we devise relevant defense techniques to make it more robust. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and extensive experiments based on real-world topology, we demonstrate that compared with prior work, STOP increases the filtering efficiency by 12%.}

	abstract = {An important aspect of querying whether a product is likely to be forged is to identify its anti-counterfeiting label. However, the use of image processing technology for label-specific texture analysis to quickly and effectively identify the anti-counterfeiting label has been widely studied. Aiming at the defects of the local binary pattern (LBP) and its variants in texture identification, this paper proposes a new texture model for anti-counterfeiting identification, that is, the circular local ternary pattern (CLTP). The highlight of our technology is that it extracts the effective local texture descriptors by using the random features of inkjet printing. This allows for the technology to not only resist the interference of noise and illumination in images of anti-counterfeiting patterns but also to encode and reorganize the fine linear shape structure. Specifically, this paper extracts the CLTP texture feature in the corresponding key areas and forms the final feature histogram vector for comparison through the one-to-one correspondence between the sample image and the inspected image of anti-counterfeiting pattern. Experiments prove that our method not only has high discrimination, stability and effectiveness but also provides a convenient and practical idea for anti-counterfeiting technology.}

	abstract = {Adversaries can deduce confidential information processed by a program by analyzing its memory access patterns. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) converts a sequence of program memory accesses to an oblivious form, hence preventing adversarial inference. In recent years, a flourishing growth of sophisticated and effective ORAM protocols has occurred. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of these protocols, some of them contain defects in their implementations or even in their design, jeopardizing their obliviousness when processing certain memory access sequences. In this paper, we present NeuralD , a practical tool for testing ORAM protocols and detecting violations of their stated obliviousness. We train a neural distinguisher to form a probabilistic testing oracle capable of determining with a bounded high probability if a pair of ORAM inputs violates the obliviousness guarantee. NeuralD incorporates a set of techniques and optimizations to provide a highly effective and practical testing pipeline. Additionally, it features a delta debugging-like method to minimize error-triggering inputs (i.e., counterexamples) — developers can use these counterexamples to debug their ORAM protocols and identify root problems. NeuralD is evaluated using well-known ORAM protocols and real-world ORAM applications (e.g., secure key-value storage). Within a few minutes, NeuralD can detect subtle violations of stated obliviousness.}

	abstract = {One of the key challenges to the X-ray security check is to detect the overlapped items in backpacks or suitcases in the X-ray images. Most existing methods improve the robustness of models to the object overlapping problem by enhancing the underlying visual information such as colors and edges. However, this strategy ignores the situations that the objects have similar visual clues as to the background, and objects overlapping each other. Since the two cases rarely appear in existing datasets, we contribute a novel dataset – Cutters and Liquid Containers X-ray Dataset (CLCXray) to complete the related research. Furthermore, we propose a novel Label-aware Mechanism (LA) to tackle the object overlapping problem. Particularly, LA establishes the associations between feature channels and different labels and adjusts the features according to the assigned labels (or pseudo labels) to help improve the prediction results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LA is accurate and robust to detect overlapped objects, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of the LA for arbitrary state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, experimental results show that the network constructed by the LA is superior to the SOTA models on OPIXray and CLCXray, especially solving the challenges of the subset of the highly overlapped objects.}

	abstract = {We consider an aeronautical ad-hoc network relying on aeroplanes operating in the presence of a spoofer. The aggregated signal received by the terrestrial base station is considered as “clean” or “normal”, if the legitimate aeroplanes transmit their signals and there is no spoofing attack. By contrast, the received signal is considered as “spurious” or “abnormal” in the face of a spoofing signal. An autoencoder (AE) is trained to learn the characteristics/features from a training dataset, which contains only normal samples associated with no spoofing attacks. The AE takes original samples as its input samples and reconstructs them at its output. Based on the trained AE, we define the detection thresholds of our spoofing discovery algorithm. To be more specific, contrasting the output of the AE against its input will provide us with a measure of geometric waveform similarity/dissimilarity in terms of the peaks of curves. To quantify the similarity between unknown testing samples and the given training samples (including normal samples), we first propose a so-called deviation-based algorithm . Furthermore, we estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) from each legitimate aeroplane and propose a so-called AoA-based algorithm . Then based on a sophisticated amalgamation of these two algorithms, we form our final detection algorithm for distinguishing the spurious abnormal samples from normal samples under a strict testing condition. In conclusion, our numerical results show that the AE improves the trade-off between the correct spoofing detection rate and the false alarm rate as long as the detection thresholds are carefully selected.}

	abstract = {In recent years, data has become the new oil that fuels various machine learning (ML) applications. Just as the oil refining, providing data to an ML model is a product of massive costs and expertise efforts. However, how to protect the intellectual property (IP) of the training data in ML remains largely open. In this paper, we present MeFA, a novel framework for detecting training data IP embezzlement via Membership Fingerprint Authentication, which is able to determine whether a suspect ML model is trained on the to be protected target data or not. The key observation is that a part of data has a similar influence on the prediction behavior of different ML models. On this basis, MeFA leverages membership inference techniques to extract these data as the fingerprints of the target data and constructs an authentication model to verify the data’s ownership by identifying the obtained membership fingerprints. MeFA has several salient features. It does not assume any knowledge of the suspect model except for its black-box prediction API, through which we can merely get the prediction output of a given input, and also does not require any modification to the dataset or the training process, since it takes advantage of the inherent membership property of the data. As a by-product, MeFA can also serve as a post-protection to verify the ownership of ML models, without modifying the training process of the model. Extensive experiments on three realistic datasets and seven types of ML models validate the effectiveness of MeFA, and demonstrate that it is also robust to scenarios when the training data is partially used or preprocessed with representative membership inference defenses.}

	abstract = {It has been widely observed that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Decision-based attacks could generate adversarial examples based solely on top-1 labels returned by the target model. However, they typically make excessive queries and could not bypass detection effectively. To comprehensively assess a decision-based attack, besides its query efficiency, the performance against detection is also a concern. Considering that previous detections consume massive resources and always mistakenly recognize benign video frames as malicious attacks, we design a lightweight detection called boundary detection to overcome the above limitations, whose success reveals serious limitations of existing decision-based attacks. To develop more powerful attacks, we first present f-mixup as a basic method to produce candidate adversarial examples in the frequency domain. Using f-mixup as the building block, we propose f-attack as a complete decision-based attack. With the help of several natural images, f-attack could both work well with limited (hundreds of) queries and bypass detection effectively. Nevertheless, if the attacker could make relatively adequate (thousands of) queries and the target model is not equipped with detection, f-attack will lag behind existing decision-based attacks. We additionally introduce frequency binary search based on f-mixup , which serves as a plug-and-play module for existing decision-based attacks to further improve their query efficiency. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Deploying data storage and query service in an untrusted cloud server raises critical privacy and security concerns. This paper focuses on the fundamental problem of processing conjunctive keyword queries over an untrusted cloud in a privacy-preserving manner. Previous tree-based searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) schemes, such as IBTree and VBTree , can process conjunctive keyword queries in a secure and efficient way. However, these schemes cannot address “Result Pattern ( RP )” leakage, which can be used to recover the keywords contained in a conjunctive keyword query. To combat this challenging problem, we propose a result pattern hiding conjunctive query scheme named Rphx using Intel SGX. In particular, we first propose a new “SGX-aware” compressed index named VIBT by combining variable-length bloom filter tree, matryoshka filter and online cipher. To achieve RP hiding, we then introduce a new tree-based SSE scheme named Rphx by deploying VIBT to Intel SGX. Security analysis shows that Rphx can enhance the security requirements by hiding RP leakage under the IND-CKA2 security model. Experimental results show that VIBT gains at least\n30×\nimprovement in storage efficiency and Rphx can achieve comparable search efficiency comparing with previous works.}

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to solve decision-making problems in computer network designs, especially in TCP congestion control. As RL-based congestion control methods enable powerful learning abilities, it achieves competitive performance and adaptiveness advantages over the traditional methods. However, RL-based systems suffer from adversarial attacks that generate perturbations to significantly degrade the performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks against RL-based congestion control systems. Unlike the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks on images where an attacker can easily obtain the input states to introduce perturbations, the attacker cannot directly obtain the input states in congestion control settings that are only available to the agents. It is challenging to add effective perturbations without knowing the input states for RL-based congestion control models. To solve the challenge, we develop an adversarial attack to estimate states of the target agent, craft adversarial perturbations, and apply the generated perturbations in an automated fashion. We evaluate how our adversarial attack affects the target agent’s decision-making process. Our experiments illustrate that our attack can effectively reduce about 50% average throughput while increasing more than 36x latency and 45% packet loss rate.}

Outsourcing GAN to cloud platform is a popular way to save local computation resources and improve the efficiency, but it still faces the privacy leakage concerns: (1) the sensitive information of the training dataset may be disclosed in the cloud; (2) the trained model may reveal the privacy of training samples since it extracts the characteristics from the data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving GAN framework (LP-GAN) for model training and image synthesis based on secret sharing scheme. Specifically, we design a series of efficient secure interactive protocols for different layers (convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, Sigmoid) of neural network (NN) used in GAN. Our protocols are scalable to build secure training or inference tasks for NN-based applications. We utilize edge computing to reduce the latency and all the protocols are executed on two edge servers collaboratively. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed solution greatly improves efficiency, reduces communication overhead, and guarantees the privacy. We prove the correctness and security of LP-GAN by theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on different real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of our scheme.}

	abstract = {Detection-based defense approaches are effective against adversarial attacks without compromising the structure of the protected model. However, they could be bypassed by stronger adversarial attacks and are limited in their ability to handle high-fidelity images. In this paper, we explore an effective detection-based defense against adversarial attacks on images (including high-resolution images) by extending the investigation beyond a single-instance perspective to incorporate its transformations as well. Our intuition is that the essential characteristics of a valid image are generally not affected by non-essential style transformations, for example, a slight variation in the facial expression of a portrait would not alter its identification. In contrast, adversarial examples are designed to affect only a single instance at a time, with unpredictable effects on a set of transformations of the instance. Consequently, we leverage a controllable generative mechanism to conduct the non-essential style transformations for a given image via modification along the style axis in the latent space. Next, the consistency of prediction between the given input and its style transformations is used to distinguish adversarial instances. Based on experiments on three image datasets, including high-resolution images, we demonstrated that our defense could detect 90–100 percent of adversarial examples produced by various state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, with a low false-positive rate.}

	abstract = {Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) has been widely recognized as a promising technique to delegate update and search queries over an outsourced database to an untrusted server while guaranteeing the privacy of data. Many efforts on DSSE have been devoted to obtaining a good tradeoff between security and performance. However, it appears that all existing DSSE works miss studying on what will happen if the DSSE client issues irrational update queries carelessly, such as duplicate update queries and delete queries to remove non-existent entries (that have been considered by many popular database system in the setting of plaintext). In this scenario, we find that (1) most prior works lose their claimed correctness or security, and (2) no single approach can achieve correctness, forward and backward security, and practical performance at the same time. To address this problem, we study for the first time the notion of robustness of DSSE. Generally, we say that a DSSE scheme is robust if it can keep the same correctness and security even in the case of misoperations. Then, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named key-updatable pseudo-random function and apply this primitive to constructing ROSE, a robust DSSE scheme with forward and backward security. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of ROSE and give the experimental comparisons.}

	abstract = {Cellular networks have been successfully evolved over the decades. Especially, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) has been exceedingly successful and the security threats against LTE systems have increased rapidly. Particularly, tracking LTE user devices has been shown to be effective as the temporary user identifiers (IDs) are easily extracted and used to locate targeted devices by passive eavesdroppers. We notice that naive approaches, such as frequent updates of temporary user IDs, are insufficient to mitigate user-tracking attacks since the new and old temporary IDs for the same user device are easily linkable by adversaries who can measure the wireless channel characteristics between the user device and herself. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic uplink power control scheme to minimize the probability of successful user tracking by an adversary whose location is unknown. We devise the notion of average inference error probability in order to measure the level of users’ location privacy. Moreover, we derive the closed-form expression of the approximated average inference error probability and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average inference error probability under a constraint of an allowable power budget for each user. Against a passive adversary, our proposed power control scheme effectively degrades an adversary’s inference ability by 50% when 10 users are scheduled in each transmission time slot, which will lead to almost 100% inference error at the adversary over multiple time slots.}

	abstract = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task that tries to recognize a person across different cameras, and that can prove useful in video surveillance as well as in forensics and security applications. However, traditional Re-ID systems analyzing image or video sequences suffer from well-known issues such as illumination changes, occlusions, background clutter, and long-term re-identification. To simultaneously address all these difficult problems, we explore a Re-ID solution based on an alternative medium that is inherently not affected by them, i.e., the Wi-Fi technology. The latter, due to the widespread use of wireless communications, has grown rapidly and is already enabling the development of Wi-Fi sensing applications, such as human localization or counting. These sensing procedures generally exploit Wi-Fi signals variations that are a direct consequence, among other things, of human presence, and which can be observed through the channel state information (CSI) of Wi-Fi access points. Following this rationale, in this paper, for the first time in literature, we show how the pervasive Wi-Fi technology can also be directly exploited for person Re-ID. More accurately, Wi-Fi signals amplitude and phase are extracted from CSI measurements and analyzed through a two-branch deep neural network working in a siamese-like fashion. The designed pipeline can extract meaningful features from signals, i.e., radio biometric signatures, that ultimately allow the person Re-ID. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated on a specifically collected dataset, where remarkable performances are obtained; suggesting that Wi-Fi signal variations differ between different people and can consequently be used for their re-identification.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel class of symmetric key distribution protocol that leverages basic security primitives offered by low-cost, hardware chipsets containing millions of synchronized self-powered timers. The keys are derived from the temporal dynamics of a physical, micro-scale time-keeping device which makes the keys immune to any potential side-channel attacks, malicious tampering, or snooping. Using the behavioral model of the self-powered timers, we first show that the derived key-strings can pass the randomness test as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) suite. The key-strings are then used in two SPoTKD (Self-Powered Timer Key Distribution) protocols that exploit the timer’s dynamics as one-way functions: (a) protocol 1 facilitates secure communications between a user and a remote Server; and (b) protocol 2 facilitates secure communications between two users. In this paper, we investigate the security of these protocols under standard model and against different adversarial attacks. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we also investigate the robustness of these protocols in the presence of real-world operating conditions and propose error-correcting SPoTKD protocols to mitigate these noise-related artifacts.}

	abstract = {Secure frequency control of multi-area hybrid power systems with wind power is a research problem involving active defense, vulnerability, and resilience. Considering the scenario that Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack intrude into the control channels of thermal power and wind farm, the hybrid power system is modeled by a switched system with four subsystems. Then, the exponential stability of hybrid power system is studied under arbitrary DoS attack. An active defense scheme is proposed to design switched control gains by Lie algebra method achieved by a distributed consensus method. Furthermore, following the resulted exponential stability, the load disturbance attenuant performance of frequency control is studied by the proposed concepts of vulnerability point and resilience point. Under a class of event-DoS attack model, the estimation method of vulnerability point and resilience point is given. Finally, simulations of a three-area hybrid power system and NE39bus test system are carried out to verify our theories.}

	abstract = {We fingerprint 54 ECUs from 10 cars, one of them being a heavy-duty vehicle that is compliant to the SAE J1939 standard. These later specifications implemented in commercial vehicles offer concrete sender addresses in every CAN frame, making physical characteristics easier to link to specific ECUs. This is not the case for traffic collected inside passenger cars where the allocation of CAN bus identifiers is non-uniform, without explicit sender and receiver addresses, making ECU identification more challenging. While previous research has shown good separation between ECUs even when single features are used, e.g., skews or maximum voltage level, prior results are based on a small number of cars, while our larger experimental basis proves that single features are likely insufficient to separate between a large number of ECUs. Concretely, for a crisp separation, at least four features seem to be needed, i.e., mean voltage, max voltage, bit time and plateau time, while clock skews or any single voltage feature lead to overlaps. We provide clear experimental bounds on the intra and inter-distances regarding skews and voltage features, not neglecting environmental variations which may occur when the car is running.}
