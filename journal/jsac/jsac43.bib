	abstract = {An increasing number of field robots would be used for mission-critical tasks in remote or post-disaster areas. Due to the limited individual abilities, these robots usually require an edge information hub (EIH), with not only communication but also sensing and computing functions. Such EIH could be deployed on a flexibly-dispatched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Different from traditional aerial base stations or mobile edge computing (MEC), the EIH would direct the operations of robots via sensing-communication-computing-control (  SC 3 \\textbf {SC}^{3}  ) closed-loop orchestration. This paper aims to optimize the closed-loop control performance of multiple   SC 3 \\textbf {SC}^{3}   loops, with constraints on satellite-backhaul rate, computing capability, and on-board energy. Specifically, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control cost is used to measure the closed-loop utility, and a sum LQR cost minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the splitting of sensor data and allocation of communication and computing resources. We first derive the optimal splitting ratio of sensor data, and then recast the problem to a more tractable form. An iterative algorithm is finally proposed to provide a sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. We also uncover the influence of   SC 3 \\textbf {SC}^{3}   parameters on closed-loop controls, highlighting more systematic understanding.}

	abstract = {The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground deployments in both communication and computing domains. In such networks, aerial platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities and finely tuned inference models trained on rich datasets, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated air-ground edge-cloud model framework, in which UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and small model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers providing large model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived based on the mAP of the edge model and mAP of the cloud model, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.}

However, due to resource heterogeneity, scheduling complexity, and fast movement, how to decide the place of executing each AI inference task is nontrivial in LEO systems. In this paper, we propose LEOEdge, an edge-assisted AI inference system for LEO satellites. We first introduce the adaptive modeling technologies that automatically generate the model for each satellite according to its computation resources. We then propose a layered scheduling optimization scheme to schedule the AI inference task in a distributed manner. LEOEdge also designs a seamless data transmission scheme to avoid transmission failure due to the LEO satellite movement. We conduct a series of simulation tests to validate the performance of the proposed LEOEdge, in terms of the neural network searching efficiency, average time execution latency, and delivery latency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where multiple UAVs with caching and computation functionalities are deployed to satisfy the heterogeneous content and service requests from the user equipments (UEs). In order to comprehensively characterize the capability of our considered network in satisfying the UEs’ requests, we define the weighted sum of the content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio as the average quality-of-experience (QoE) of our network and adopt it as the performance metric. Through analysis, we show how the average QoE of our network is dependent on the content cache and service placement decisions at the UAVs, as well as the computation task offloading decisions at the UEs, thus enabling us to formulate an average QoE maximization problem, subject to practical constraints on the UAVs’ caching and computation capabilities. To solve this NP-hard problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, namely, the content cache and service placement optimization sub-problem and the task offloading optimization sub-problem. Gibbs sampling-based and matching game-based algorithms are proposed to efficiently solve these sub-problems iteratively. Via numerical results, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Compared to various benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can significantly improve the average QoE of our considered network, especially when the caching and computation resources of the UAVs are limited.}

However, the heterogeneous caching hardware, communication environments, and frequent network dynamics make the optimization of content caching policy highly complicated. Firstly, considering all LEO satellites as caching satellites can lead to content duplication and radio interference, causing storage waste and NTN transmission quality deterioration. Secondly, how to provide customized QoS by intra-layer and inter-layer cooperative caching in such complicated environments remains an open issue. Thus, we propose a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme to select caching LEO satellites with reduced system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Hierarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MADRL-HCAU) strategy is designed to manage the caching capacity of LEO satellites and UAVs, providing customized services for CAVs and dispensing the peak traffic. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can not only effectively accelerate the caching refreshing and content downloading process but also significantly reduce the packet drop and improve the cache hit ratio.}

	abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system has revolutionized the way to provide wireless seamless access on a global scale. One of the primary limitations is the low data rates resulting from Doppler shifts induced by the high mobility of LEO satellites. Although orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to deal with the serious Doppler problem by converting a time-variant fading channel in the time-frequency (TF) domain into a time-invariant channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, it needs to be reconsidered in the LEO satellite system due to the facts that the scale of Doppler axes is not big enough and the velocity of satellite is too fast. In this paper, we analyze two interferences caused by Doppler that will be produced in OTFS-based LEO satellite system. Specifically, we establish a system model of LEO satellite-to-ground communication, involving the fractional Doppler interference (FDI) from the non-integer Doppler tap, and the other is the squint Doppler interference (SDI) from the frequency-dependent Doppler. By deriving the closed-form expressions of FDI and SDI respectively, we find that the simplest but most practical solution to mitigate interference is to increase the value of DD plane bins. Finally, numerical results showcase the significant impact of Doppler on transmission signals by quantifying the signal-to-interference (SIR) ratio and bit error rate (BER) and highlight the dominance of an applicable number of bins on alleviating Doppler in OTFS-based LEO satellite system.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection for cooperative multi-satellite-enhanced random access, where orthogonal time-frequency space modulation with the large antenna array is utilized to combat the dynamics of the terrestrial-satellite links (TSLs). We introduce the generalized complex exponential basis expansion model to parameterize TSLs, thereby reducing the pilot overhead. By exploiting the block sparsity of the TSLs in the angular domain, a message passing algorithm is designed for initial channel estimation. Subsequently, we examine two cooperative modes to leverage the spatial diversity within satellite constellations: the centralized mode, where computations are performed at a high-power central server, and the distributed mode, where computations are offloaded to edge satellites with minimal signaling overhead. Specifically, in the centralized mode, device identification is achieved by aggregating backhaul information from edge satellites, and channel estimation and symbol detection are jointly enhanced through a structured approximate expectation propagation (AEP) algorithm. In the distributed mode, edge satellites share channel information and exchange soft information about data symbols, leading to a distributed version of AEP. The introduced basis expansion model for TSLs enables the efficient implementation of both centralized and distributed algorithms via fast Fourier transform. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed schemes significantly outperform conventional algorithms in terms of the activity error rate, the normalized mean squared error, and the symbol error rate. Notably, the distributed mode achieves performance comparable to the centralized mode with only two exchanges of soft information about data symbols within the constellation.}

	abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SATCOM) with ubiquitous global connectivity is deemed a pivotal catalyst in advancing wireless communication systems for 5G and beyond. LEO SATCOM excels in delivering versatile information services across expansive areas, facilitating both unicast and multicast transmissions via high-speed broadband capability. Nonetheless, given the broadband coverage of LEO SATCOM, traffic demand distribution within the service area is non-uniform, and the time/frequency/power resources available at LEO satellites remain significantly limited. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a rate-matching framework for non-orthogonal unicast and multicast (NOUM) transmission. Our approach aims to minimize the difference between offered rates and traffic demands for both unicast and multicast messages. By multiplexing unicast and multicast transmissions over the same radio resource, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed to manage interference between unicast and multicast streams, as well as inter-user interference under imperfect channel state information at the LEO satellite. To address the formulated problem’s non-smoothness and non-convexity, the common rate is approximated using the LogSumExp technique. Thereafter, we represent the common rate portion as the ratio of the approximated function, converting the problem into an unconstrained form. A generalized power iteration (GPI)-based algorithm, coined GPI-RS-NOUM, is proposed upon this reformulation. Through comprehensive numerical analysis across diverse simulation setups, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms various benchmarks for LEO SATCOM with uneven traffic demands.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, a delay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme exhibiting strong robustness against the Doppler shifts, has the potentials to be employed in LEO satellite communications. However, the performance comparison with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and the resource allocation scheme for multiuser OTFS-based LEO satellite communication system have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we conduct a performance comparison under various channel conditions between the OTFS and OFDM modulations, encompassing evaluations of sum-rate and bit error ratio (BER). Additionally, we investigate the joint optimal allocation of power and delay-Doppler resource blocks aiming at maximizing sum-rate for multiuser downlink OTFS-based LEO satellite communication systems. Unlike the conventional modulations relying on complex input-output relations within the Time-Frequency (TF) domain, the OTFS modulation exploits both time and frequency diversities, i.e., delay and Doppler shifts remain constant during a OTFS frame, which facilitates a DD domain input-output simple relation for our investigation. We transform the resulting non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem into an equivalent difference of convex problem by decoupling the conditional constraints, and solve the transformed problem via penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the OTFS modulation is robust to carrier frequency offsets (CFO) caused by high-mobility of LEO satellites, and has superior performance to the OFDM modulation. Moreover, numerical results indicate that our proposed resource allocation scheme has higher sum-rate than existing schemes for the OTFS modulation, such as delay divided multiple access and Doppler divided multiple access, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.}

	abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are the key enabler for achieving 6G ubiquitous connectivity. With the rapid progress of small satellite technology and the surging demands on direct-to-satellite services, a global wave of building LEO satellite constellations has been arisen. LEO satellite communications are the typical high mobility scenarios and suffer from severe Doppler effects. To overcome this challenge, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based LEO satellite communications have recently been studied, which exploit high mobility to obtain delay-Doppler diversity. However, due to limited satellite transmit power and very long propagation distance, the satellite-to-ground (S2G) links are very weak, and also suffer from inter-beam and inter-satellite interference. In this paper, we study coordinated multi-satellite transmission for OTFS-based LEO satellite communications to significantly improve the performance of S2G transmission, through enabling multiple satellites to cooperatively serve ground users. Furthermore, considering different delay and Doppler offsets among cooperative LEO satellites, we propose simultaneous pilots-based aggregate channel estimation (SP-ACE) scheme to improve channel estimation, which aggregately estimates the channels in S2G joint transmission by regarding the channels of all cooperative links as a single channel. Besides integer Doppler, we also consider fractional Doppler and propose three-stage peak-searching correlation (PSC)-based fractional Doppler estimation. Finally, simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated multi-satellite transmission scheme, SP-ACE and three-stage PSC fractional Doppler estimation schemes.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as flexible aerial platforms, enriching air-ground communication networks in various ways. To support massive connectivity within limited time-frequency blocks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed to be integrated into UAV networks. However, a common issue associated with almost all NOMA schemes is the susceptibility to inter-user interference (IUI). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-UAV cooperative system aided by NOMA with index modulation (IM), termed MCU-NOMA-IM, to improve the performance of air-ground networks by mitigating IUI and also avoiding the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding method that is prone to error floors. With MCU-NOMA-IM, the information bits pertaining to multiple UAVs are mapped into multiple dimensions, including the modulated symbols, subcarrier indices, and energy allocation patterns. To fully investigate the performance of MCU-NOMA-IM on air-ground networks, we consider scenarios in the presence of three and four UAVs and derive upper-bounds for the bit error rates (BERs). In addition, we propose a multi-clustered-UAV cooperative system aided by NOMA with IM (MCCU-NOMA-IM), which groups closely located UAVs into several clusters to reduce the requirement for time resources. Simulation results demonstrate that both MCU-NOMA-IM and MCCU-NOMA-IM greatly outperform cooperative NOMA and non-cooperative NOMA-IM schemes, especially for distant UAVs when the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. Also, we show that the derived BER upper bounds are asymptotically tight.}

	abstract = {Both the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) and the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are promising technologies in future communication systems. This paper investigates the mobile user (MU) tracking and robust beamforming design by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an SAGIN-ISAC system. Two schemes for acquiring the location information of MUs at the UAV are proposed, namely the space-assisted and ISAC-assisted schemes. The former requires the precise location information from the satellite by the space-air transmission, while the latter estimates the location information of MUs via a proposed extended Kalman filter based algorithm. The obtained location information is then utilized to predict the channel distribution of MUs, which can be used to formulate an outage-constrained energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. The considered problem is first reformulated based on the Bernstein-type inequality to derive computationally tractable forms of the outage probability constraints. Then, the reformulated problem is solved via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation methods, where the tightness of employing SDR is theoretically proved. Numerical results illustrate the trajectories of the UAV for tracking MUs under the space-assisted and ISAC-assisted schemes, and discuss the impact of the space-air transmission on the EE performance. It is observed that there exists a trade-off between space-air transmission overhead and location prediction precision of MUs. By integrating the ISAC in SAGIN, the information demand from the space is reduced compared with traditional SAGIN.}

	abstract = {As a means to provide ubiquitous connectivity across the ground-air-space 3D network, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellation systems comprising thousands of LEO satellites have attracted significant interest from both academia and industry recently. One major issue of LEO mega-constellation systems is the frequent handovers between satellites and beams, causing an increase in communication latency and deterioration of quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a user-centric cooperative communication framework for next generation (xG) LEO satellite mega-constellation systems. In the proposed framework, a group of LEO satellites simultaneously serve all the user equipments (UEs) using the same timefrequency resources. By dynamically organizing the clusters of serving satellites and coordinating their joint transmission based on statistical channel state information (CSI), the handover frequency and inter-satellite interference can be reduced effectively, thereby achieving significant enhancements in the spectral efficiency and coverage probability. From the achievable rate analysis and extensive simulations on realistic xG LEO satellite communication environments, we show that the proposed scheme substantially improves the spectral efficiency and coverage over the conventional beam-centric systems.}

We consider a system model involving multiple ground stations (GSs) and a single satellite, addressing the sum rate maximization problem with link-association, power, elevation angle, and minimum quality-of-service constraints. The proposed method initially segregates satellite-serviced users to reduce interference among the remaining GS-serviced users, taking into account the locations and movements of those UAMs. Subsequently, using a graph-theoretical approach, we convert the GS link association problem into a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem. In this process, we employ an analytical method involving polynomial approximations or a numerical method using integral approximation through the sum of time-sampled parameters. We then address the non-convex power allocation problem for scheduled links through iterative algorithms. The proposed scheduling and power allocation algorithms effectively manage interference in multi-UAM and multi-GS environments, and their performance is validated through extensive simulation results. Our study provides a comprehensive framework and strategy for efficient downlink transmission in future UAM operations, paving the way for novel applications in 6G NTN.}

	abstract = {Network slicing (NS) is one of the key techniques to manage logical and functionally separated networks on a common infrastructure, in a dynamic manner. As the complexity of virtualizing a full infrastructure required unprecedented effort, the initial idea of combining satellite and terrestrial networks has not been fully implemented in 5G yet. 6G networks are expected to further bring NS to a substrate network that is more heterogeneous, due to the full integration between terrestrial and satellite networks. NS describes the process of accommodating virtual networks, typically composed of nodes and links with the respective requirements, into the main infrastructure. This is an NP-Hard problem, typically also known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). Existing VNE solutions are designed per use-case and lack flexibility, adaptation and traffic-awareness, especially in such dynamic satellite environment. In this work, we investigate the VNE implementation to integrated satellite-terrestrial networks and propose a novel flexible framework, named Slice-Aware VNE for Satellite-Terrestrial (SAST-VNE), which 1) operates based on traffic prioritization; 2) jointly optimizes the load-balancing and the migration cost when network congestion occurs; and 3) provides a near-optimal solution. We compare SAST-VNE to existing well-known near-optimal VNE algorithms such as VINEYard and CEVNE and the shortest-path SN-VNE solution for satellite networks. The simulations showed that SAST-VNE reduces the migration costs between 10% and 40% during satellite handovers while maintaining the network load under control. Furthermore, when congestion occurs, SAST-VNE proved to be flexible in matching the priority of the slice, i.e., tolerated latency, with the time complexity and optimality of the solution.}

	abstract = {The combination of a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can further improve channel quality and extend coverage. However, the high-quality air-to-ground link is more vulnerable to eavesdropping by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate STAR-RIS-assisted covert communication in UAV non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with a warden Willie, where Alice intends to transmit the covert signal to a near user Bob under the cover of a far user Carol via STAR-RIS. We aim to maximize the covert transmission rate by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming as well as the UAV location. The error detection probability and optimal detection threshold for Willie are first derived to obtain an analytic solution for the minimum detection error probability. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the covert transmission rate under the condition of guaranteeing the communication of Carol and satisfying the covertness constraint of Bob. Specifically, the nonconvex problem is decomposed into three sub-problems by block coordinate descent, which are then solved using semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert communication scheme for STAR-RIS assisted UAV air-ground networks.}

	abstract = {Near-space airship-borne communication network is recognized to be an indispensable component of the future integrated ground-air-space network thanks to airships’ advantage of long-term residency at stratospheric altitudes, but it urgently needs reliable and efficient Airship-to-X link. To improve the transmission efficiency and capacity, this paper proposes to integrate semantic communication with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. Specifically, we propose a deep joint semantic coding and beamforming (JSCBF) scheme for airship-based massive MIMO image transmission network in space, in which semantics from both source and channel are fused to jointly design the semantic coding and physical layer beamforming. First, we design two semantic extraction networks to extract semantics from image source and channel state information, respectively. Then, we propose a semantic fusion network that can fuse these semantics into complex-valued semantic features for subsequent physical-layer transmission. To efficiently transmit the fused semantic features at the physical layer, we then propose the hybrid data and model-driven semantic-aware beamforming networks. At the receiver, a semantic decoding network is designed to reconstruct the transmitted images. Finally, we perform end-to-end deep learning to jointly train all the modules, using the image reconstruction quality at the receivers as a metric. The proposed deep JSCBF scheme fully combines the efficient source compressibility and robust error correction capability of semantic communication with the high spectral efficiency of massive MIMO, achieving a significant performance improvement over existing approaches.}

	abstract = {Satellite communication (SatCom) is regarded as a key enabler for bridging connectivity and capacity gaps in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites raises significant intersystem interference risks with Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) systems. This paper introduces a cooperative multi-satellite multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transmission framework to mitigate such interference while enhancing LEO SatCom performance. Specifically, cooperative beamforming is designed under a non-coherent cell-free paradigm, considering both adaptive and max ratio (MR) precoding, as well as statistical and two-timescale channel state information (CSI), aiming to synthesize the advantages of cell-free and RIS into SatCom in a practical way. Firstly, an alternating optimization (AO)-based design leveraging statistical CSI with adaptive precoding is proposed. Then, we propose a power allocation algorithm under MR precoding with given RIS phase shifts obtained from the former, along with a direct two-stage design bypassing prior results. Additionally, we extend derived closed-form expressions and proposed algorithms to exploit two-timescale CSI. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of intersystem interference mitigation constraints, compare the performance of proposed algorithms, draw insights into the effects of transmit power, interference threshold, and Rician factors, validate SatCom performance enhancements achieved by RISs, and discuss the advantages of multi-satellite cooperation.}

However, with the increasing number of IoT users, the collision probability of S-ALOHA escalates and further degrades the system performance. In this paper, we focus on the massive IoT device uplink access in SAGIN aided by high altitude platform stations (HAPS), investigating power allocation for IoT devices to maximize system access capability and spectral efficiency (SE). Specifically, we first optimize 3D deployment of HAPS. Then the resilient massive access (RMA) based on flexible fusion of S-ALOHA and non-orthogonal multiple access methods is proposed. To maximize system SE with device power constraints, we model the sequential decision problem as a Markov decision process and solve it with the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed RMA can significantly improve the IoT terminal successful access probability and the resource scheduling based on A2C also significantly increases the system SE with low complexity.}

This multi-layered communication system integrates space, air, and terrestrial segments, each with computational capability, and also serves as a ubiquitous computing platform. An efficient task offloading and resource allocation scheme is key in SAGIN to maximize resource utilization efficiency, meeting the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements for different service types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic SAGIN model featuring diverse antenna configurations, two timescale types, different channel models for each segment, and dual service types. We formulate a problem of sequential decision-making task offloading and resource allocation. Our proposed solution is an innovative online approach referred to as graphic deep reinforcement learning (GDRL). This approach utilizes a graph neural network (GNN)-based feature extraction network to identify the inherent dependencies within the graphical structure of the states. We design an action mapping network with an encoding scheme for end-to-end generation of task offloading and resource allocation decisions. Additionally, we incorporate meta-learning into GDRL to swiftly adapt to rapid changes in key parameters of the SAGIN environment, significantly reducing online deployment complexity. Simulation results validate that our proposed GDRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL approaches by achieving the highest reward and lowest overall latency.}

	abstract = {Due to the high dynamic of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the beam of UAV-mounted aerial base station (ABS) is difficult to align with ground users (GUs) and macro-cell base stations (MBSs), thereby reducing the communication rate. Towards this end, the channel state information of communication is used to assist onboard radar of ABS to sense the locations of GUs and MBSs for beam alignment to increase communication rate. To clarify the mechanism of mutual assistance between sensing and communication, we first derive the fundamental communication rate lower bound of integrated sensing and communication by utilizing the Cramér-Rao Bound. We find that the sensing power, sensing time, and transmit power between GU-ABS and ABS-MBS mutually influence the bounds of their communication rates with the shared frequency between sensing and communication. Accordingly, the maximizing communication rate problem is established by jointly optimizing transmit power, sensing power, and sensing dwell time allocation, which is decoupled into GU-ABS and ABS-MBS resource allocation subproblems. To reduce the computation complexity, a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm is proposed to solve this problem to replace the successive convex approximation technique. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in maximizing the communication rate.}

	abstract = {This work proposes a quantum-aided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed to enhance the accuracy of direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and the efficiency of computational task offloading in integrated sensing and communication systems. Traditional DRL approaches face challenges in handling high-dimensional state spaces and ensuring convergence to optimal policies within complex operational environments. The proposed quantum-aided DRL framework that operates in a military surveillance system exploits quantum computing’s parallel processing capabilities to encode operational states and actions into quantum states, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the decision space. For the very first time in literature, we propose a quantum-enhanced actor-critic method, utilizing quantum circuits for policy representation and optimization. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that our framework improves DoA estimation accuracy by 91.66% and 82.61% over existing DRL algorithms with faster convergence rate, and effectively manages the trade-off between sensing and communication and by optimizing task offloading decisions under stringent ultra-reliable low-latency communication requirements. Comparative analysis also reveals that our approach reduces the overall task offloading latency by 43.09% and 32.35% compared to the DRL-based deep deterministic policy gradient and proximal policy optimization algorithms, respectively.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of on-board computing technology, on-orbit information processing has become a new direction for reducing service response delays and improving the quality of space-based information services. Especially in space-air–ground integrated applications in 6G networks, remote sensing image processing tasks are highly important because of their critical role in applications such as environmental monitoring and public safety. However, the fluctuations in data volume due to significant scene differences, along with the limitations in individual satellite capabilities caused by size and power constraints, present new challenges for on-orbit image processing. To address these challenges, we model a data-driven on-orbit resource scheduling problem for space-air-ground integrated networks based on distributionally robust optimization, aiming to minimize the average image processing delay. We first construct an ambiguity set based on the Wasserstein distance and the historical distribution of image data, which helps transform the original upper-bound expectation problem into an explicitly expressed mixed-integer nonlinear (MINLP) problem. Furthermore, to reduce complexity and expedite the solution process, we decouple the MINLP problem into three subproblems using the block coordinate descent method and designed an iterative solving algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better fitting accuracy than traditional methods and reduces the average image processing delay.}

In addition, the operators allow the UAV-UE, whose demand cannot be satisfied by the licensed band, to compete with others to obtain bandwidth resources from the unlicensed spectrum. Considering inter-cell and inter-operator interference in the licensed and unlicensed spectrum, the user association, power allocation, and dynamic spectrum sharing are jointly optimized to maximize the network throughput while ensuring the UAV-UEs’ data rate requirements. The formulated optimization problem, which is an NP-hard problem, is divided into two sequential subproblems. We propose a distributed iterative algorithm composed of a matching game, coalition game, and successive convex approximation technique to jointly solve the user association and power control subproblems in the licensed spectrum. Afterwards, we propose a three-layer auction framework to allocate the unlicensed spectrum dynamically between operators. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms with the additional use of the unlicensed spectrum achieve 86.8% higher system throughput than that of only using the licensed spectrum.}

In this scenario with multiple potential nodes, it is crucial having efficient ways to allocate the network resources between all the potential users. We propose a simple method for routing and wavelength assignment in wavelength multiplexed networks in which classical and quantum channels coexist. The proposed heuristics take into account the specific requirements of quantum key distribution and focus on keeping at bay the contamination of the quantum channels by photons coming from the classical signals from non-linear processes, among others. These heuristics reduce the shared path between classical and quantum channels and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the quantum channels, improving their quantum key rate. We compare the results to the usual classical RWA approach.}

	abstract = {Distributed Traffic Engineering (TE) aims to optimize network performance by generating individual routing strategies at each router without a global view of the network. A major challenge for these TE solutions is handling performance degradation caused by unexpected traffic fluctuations and unpredictable link failures. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have introduced new opportunities to enhance distributed TE. In this paper, we propose Path-Based Graph Neural Network (PathGNN), which leverages the emerging GNN architecture to quickly infer robust and resilient routing strategies in a distributed manner to accommodate unexpected network conditions. PathGNN adopts a novel path-link bipartite graph modeling approach to capture the dynamics of link resources shared by routing paths. It then performs efficient GNN message exchanges among routers to make adaptive local routing decisions for better load balancing. Additionally, PathGNN leverages Supervised Learning (SL) to directly learn from optimal routing strategies through efficient offline training. Evaluation results on four real-world network topologies demonstrate PathGNN’s strong generalization capability. Compared to state-of-the-art distributed TE solutions, PathGNN improves the load balancing performance by at least 24.4% with lower end-to-end delay under dynamic traffic scenarios, and also boosts performance by up to 35.3% under multiple link failures.}

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of wireless networks, achieving enhanced throughput with low latency for data transmission is crucial for future communication systems. While low complexity OSPF-type solutions have shown effectiveness in lightly-loaded networks, they often falter in the face of increasing congestion. Recent approaches have suggested utilizing backpressure and deep learning techniques for route optimization. However, these approaches face challenges due to their high implementation and computational complexity, surpassing the capabilities of networks with limited hardware devices. A key challenge is developing algorithms that improve throughput and reduce latency while keeping complexity levels compatible with OSPF. In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University and Ceragon Networks Ltd., we address this challenge by developing a novel approach, dubbed Regularized Routing Optimization (RRO). The RRO algorithm offers both distributed and centralized implementations with low complexity, making it suitable for integration into 5G and beyond technologies, where no significant changes to the existing protocols are needed. It increases throughput while ensuring latency remains sufficiently low through regularized optimization. We analyze the computational complexity of RRO and prove that it converges with a level of complexity comparable to OSPF. Extensive simulation results across diverse network topologies demonstrate that RRO significantly outperforms existing methods.}

Many efforts have been made to address these needs, with Deterministic Networking (DetNet) being one such initiative. DetNet aims to guarantee delivery with low latency and minimal jitter, ensuring high reliability and performance for time-sensitive applications. However, DetNet applicability in real-world scenarios is limited due to the need of a lower-layer protocol supporting resource reservation procedures (e.g., MPLS), and the lack of publicly available implementations. In this work, we present SRv6 Live-Live, an easy-to-deploy and highly scalable implementation of DetNet functions using the Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) model. The SRv6 Live-Live behavior replicates packets of a selected flow across multiple paths at the ingress of the SRv6 domain and drops redundant replicas at the egress. After discussing insights about the paths’ selection strategy, we provide a SRv6 Live-Live implementation for programmable data planes using P4. We also propose the use of SRv6 Live-Live for best path selection at line rate, in SD-WAN scenarios. The main results obtained in the extensive performance evaluation are that SRv6 Live-Live preserves the throughput in case of congestion and reduces the tail end-to-end delay with a marginal impact on best-effort flows.}

	abstract = {Survivable routing is crucial in backbone networks to ensure connectivity, even during failures. During network design, groups of network elements prone to potential failure events are identified. These groups are referred to as Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs). When these SRLGs consist of a set of links intersected by a connected region of the plane, they are termed regional-SRLGs. A recent study has presented a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum number of regional-SRLG-disjoint paths between two given nodes in a planar topology, where the paths are node-disjoint. However, existing algorithms for this problem are not practical due to their runtime and implementation complexities. This paper investigates a more general model in two aspects. First, instead of node-disjointness, we search for non-crossing regional-SRLG-disjoint paths. Second, we show how the algorithm can be extended to solve problems in directed networks. It introduces an efficient and easily implementable algorithmic framework, leveraging an arbitrarily chosen shortest path finding subroutine for graphs with possibly negative weights. Depending on the subroutine chosen, the framework either improves the previous worst-case runtime complexity or can solve the problem with high probability (w.h.p.) in near-linear expected time. The proposed framework enables the first additive approximation for a more general   N \\mathscr {N} P \\mathscr {P}  -hard version of the problem, where the objective is to find the maximum number of regional-SRLG-disjoint paths. We validate our findings through extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is an innovative and adaptable source routing technique that enhances interconnection services. It plays a pivotal role in next-generation networking technologies, providing crucial support for network telemetry, computing power networks, and related technologies. The end-to-end connectivity capability of SRv6 is highly regarded by ISPs, driving its widespread deployment in networks. However, configuring an SRv6 network can be challenging and prone to errors due to the complexity of low-level configuration languages and numerous protocol parameters. To address this issue, we present AutoSRv6, a system designed to synthesize SRv6 configurations for large, evolving networks using high-level abstractions of network topology and policies. AutoSRv6 leverages formal constraint-solving techniques and SMT solvers to compute protocol parameters and generate configuration files that align with network policies. Furthermore, AutoSRv6 incorporates a mechanism to overcome the constraints imposed by hardware, mapping the end-to-end path to a SID (Segment Identifier) sequence. We have developed a prototype of AutoSRv6 and conducted experiments on diverse network topologies, evaluating its performance with various network policies. The results show that autoSRv6 can generate the network configuration satisfying the policy, the time cost of IGP synthesis is better than the existing method, and the length of the segment list is optimized by more than 2 times.}

	abstract = {Fast reroute (FRR) is among the fastest survivable routing approaches in packet-switched networks, because the routers are equipped with a resilient routing table in advance such that the packets can be rerouted instantly upon failures solely relying on local information, i.e., without notification messages. However, designing the routing algorithm for FRR is challenging as the number of possible sets of failed network links can be extremely high, while the algorithm should keep track of which routers are aware of the failure. Therefore, FRR methods often rely on spanning arborescences, which provide multiple disjoint failover paths up to the global connectivity of the network. In this paper, we propose a generic algorithmic framework that theoretically increases the number of failover paths to the local connectivity between each node and the root by extending an efficient connectivity preserving operation from graph theory – called edge splitting-off – to decompose the network topology node-by-node, and use Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) on these partial subproblems to build routing arborescences in the reverse direction for the original topology. Although our practical implementation cannot reach the local connectivity in all instances, we demonstrate through simulations that it still outperforms the state-of-the-art FRR mechanisms and provides better resilience with shorter paths in the arborescences.}

In this paper, we demonstrate that this concept can also be applied to the use case of tactical TE to considerably reduce the number of network changes required to react to critical events, thereby facilitating lower provisioning times and a generally improved time-to-repair. For this, we develop MOLS, a Local Search-based optimization routine that is able to provide close to optimal solutions within just a couple of seconds. The latter is shown based on extensive evaluations featuring various real-world topologies, including data from the backbone of a Tier-1 Internet Service Provider. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches relying on conventional SR, MOLS achieves similar or better solution quality while requiring substantially fewer configuration changes to implement the respective solutions. Furthermore, MOLS is able to resolve over 99% of overutilization scenarios resulting from different failure types, mostly within sub-second fashion and with an exceptionally small number of changes. Lastly, we also extend MOLS to adhere to specified latency bounds while even fixing initially violated ones.}

	abstract = {Traffic engineering (TE) has attracted extensive attention over the years. Operators expect to design a TE scheme that accommodates traffic dynamics well and achieves good TE performance with little overhead. Some approaches like oblivious routing compute an optimal static routing based on a large traffic matrix (TM) range, which usually leads to much performance loss. Many approaches compute routing solutions based on one or a few representative TMs obtained from observed historical TMs. However, they may suffer from performance degradation for unexpected TMs and usually induce much overhead of system operating. In this paper, we propose ALTE, an adaptive and low-cost TE scheme based on TM classification. We develop a novel clustering algorithm to properly group a set of historical TMs into several clusters and compute a candidate routing solution for each TM cluster. A machine learning classifier is trained to infer the proper candidate routing solution online based on the features extracted from some easily measured statistics. We implement a system prototype of ALTE and do extensive simulations and experiments using both real and synthetic traffic traces. The results show that ALTE achieves near-optimal performance for dynamic traffic and introduces little overhead of routing updates.}

	abstract = {Many new cloud services and applications have emerged recently. They account for a large share of traffic in Wide Area Networks (WANs) and provide traffic with various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) offers a promising opportunity for improving the performance of these applications with flexible network management. Nevertheless, SD-WANs are managed by controllers, and unpredictable controller failures may degrade flexible network management. Switches previously controlled by the failed controllers become offline, and flows traversing these offline switches lose the path programmability to route flows on available forwarding paths. Thus, these offline flows cannot be routed/rerouted on available paths to accommodate potential traffic variations, leading to severe performance degradation. Traffic Engineering (TE) is a prevalent network application, which aims to enable differentiable QoS for these numerous cloud services and applications. However, TE performance cannot be guaranteed when controller failures happen due to the loss of flexible network management. Existing recovery solutions reassign offline switches to other active controllers to recover the degraded path programmability but may not promise good TE performance since higher path programmability does not necessarily guarantee satisfactory TE performance. In this paper, we propose Ares to provide predictable TE performance under controller failures. We formulate an optimization problem, which aims to maintain predictable TE performance by jointly considering fine-grained flow-controller reassignment and flow rerouting. Given that the proposed problem is proven to be NP-hard, we further propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. Specifically, when controller failures occur, Ares updates real-time network information with traffic traces and failure status to calculate optimal flow-controller reassignment and flow rerouting policies. Ares then reassigns and reroutes offline flows to maintain predictable TE performance. Extensive simulation results under two real-world topologies with traffic traces demonstrate that our problem formulation exhibits comparable load balancing performance to optimal TE solution without controller failures, and the proposed Ares can significantly improve average load balancing performance by up to 35.79% with low computation time compared with the state-of-the-art solution.}

	abstract = {Supporting ubiquitous deployment of built-in Internet service with Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has been widely accepted as one of the key technologies for the next-generation communication services. By integrating terrestrial and space network capabilities, new design features are introduced to existing network ecosystems. For instance, terrestrial Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can now be hosted on satellites, utilizing satellite highways. This requires expanding the roles of the control units, originally responsible for terrestrial data planes, to include space-based counterparts. As a result, seamless integration of Service Function Chains (SFCs) across satellite constellations and terrestrial control units becomes a challenge due to the topology dynamics caused by high-speed LEO satellites. In this paper, we propose the Geosynchronous Service Function Chaining (GSFC) scheme to facilitate programmable, Internet SFC operations based on LEO satellite network environments. The key idea is to cluster adjacent LEO satellites to represent logical VNF containers at the fixed positions, where the initial VNFs at the region are continuously filled up by the traversing satellite payload functions in a predictable manner. With this design, the ground-based controllers can maintain the space-terrestrial SFCs without being affected by the constantly shifting satellite VNFs, and thereby large-scale and complex recalculation for the routing policies is avoided. The design principle introduces a ground-breaking approach to space Internet protocol stacks, facilitating robust routing for SFC operations across integrated space and terrestrial networks. Our simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed GSFC-based VNF orchestration mechanism and reveal the trade-offs in both data and control plane performance.}

	abstract = {Packet classification is a key mechanism that classifies incoming packets into flows to enable software-defined networking as well as a variety of networking services. Currently, ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) has been widely used for high-speed and low-latency packet classification. However, both range expansion and update performance are the fundamental issues for TCAM-based packet classification. A rule containing ranges could be replicated to multiple rules after converting its ranges into prefixes or ternary strings to occupy more than one TCAM entry. Many range encoding algorithms have been proposed to alleviate or avoid the problem of range expansion. These algorithms can be classified into database-independent (DI) and database-dependent (DD). While database-independent algorithms can accommodate new ranges without re-encoding the existing ranges, they may still cause rule replication. In contrast, database-dependent algorithms could avoid rule replication by adaptively encoding ranges, but new ranges may result in updates of the existing ranges. Accordingly, both types of algorithms may multiply the cost of TCAM updates. In this paper, we propose a DD range-encoding algorithm, Longest Enclosure Prefix Range Encoding (LEPRE), which can ensure that any new range does not cause any rule replication and re-encoding of the existing ranges. LEPRE employs the original fields as a part of range encoding to significantly decrease the requirements of extra bits for range encoding. Our experiment results show that LEPRE can maximize the TCAM storage efficiency. LEPRE also fully supports incremental updates to minimize the latency of TCAM updates.}

	abstract = {Video content providers such as Douyin implement Peer-to-Peer Content Delivery Networks (PCDNs) to reduce the costs associated with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) while still maintaining optimal user-perceived quality of experience (QoE). PCDNs rely on the remaining resources of edge devices, such as edge access devices and hosts, to store and distribute data with a Multiple-Server-to-One-Client (MS2OC) communication pattern. MS2OC parallel transmission pattern suffers from severe data out-of-order issues. PCDNs offer significant cost savings by using multiple low-cost edge devices. However, due to its unique characteristics, including pull-based streaming transmission, many heterogeneous paths, and large receiving buffers, directly applying existing schedulers designed for Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to PCDN fails to meet the two goals of high aggregate bandwidth and low end-to-end delivery latency. To tackle this issue, we provide a detailed overview of Douyin’s self-developed PCDN video transmission system and introduce the first QoE-enhanced packet-level scheduler for PCDN systems, named Pscheduler. Pscheduler evaluates path quality with a congestion-control-decoupled algorithm and employs our proposed path-pick-packet method for data distribution, ensuring a smooth video playback experience. Additionally, we propose a redundant transmission algorithm to enhance task download speeds for segmented video transmission. Our extensive online A/B tests, involving 100,000 Douyin users generating tens of millions of video data points, demonstrate that Pscheduler achieves an average improvement of 60% in goodput, a 20% reduction in data delivery waiting time, and a 30% reduction in rebuffering rates. Furthermore, we conducted simulation experiments that further validate the effectiveness of Pscheduler, confirming its improvements in performance metrics under various network conditions.}

It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs.

	abstract = {Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key candidate technology for the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. Nevertheless, using substantial numbers of antennas to transmit high-frequency signals in ELAA systems significantly exacerbates the near-field effect. Unfortunately, traditional hybrid beamforming schemes are highly vulnerable to ELAA near-field communications. To effectively mitigate severe near-field effect, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture for ELAA systems, in which each antenna is either adaptively connected to one radio frequency (RF) chain for signal transmission or deactivated for power saving. For the case that instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is available during each channel coherence time, a real-time dynamic hybrid beamforming design is developed to maximize the achievable sum rate under the constraints of the constant modulus of phase-shifters (PSs), non-overlapping dynamic connection network and total transmit power. When instantaneous CSI cannot be easily obtained in real-time, we propose a two-timescale dynamic hybrid beamforming design, which optimizes analog beamformer in long-timescale and digital beamformer in short-timescale, with the goal of maximizing ergodic sum-rate under the same constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture and the effectiveness of the developed algorithms for ELAA near-field communications.}

	abstract = {The advancement of Rydberg atoms in quantum information technology is driving a paradigm shift from classical radio-frequency (RF) receivers to Rydberg atomic receivers. Capitalizing on the extreme sensitivity of Rydberg atoms to external electromagnetic fields, Rydberg atomic receivers are capable of realizing more precise radio-wave measurements than RF receivers to support high-performance wireless communication and sensing. Although the atomic receiver is developing rapidly in quantum-physics domain, its integration with wireless communications is at a nascent stage. In particular, systematic methods to enhance communication performance through this integration are yet to be discovered. Motivated by this observation, we propose in this paper to incorporate Rydberg atomic receivers into multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication, a prominent 5G technology, as the first attempt on implementing atomic MIMO receivers. To begin with, we provide a comprehensive introduction on the principles of Rydberg atomic receivers and build on them to design the atomic MIMO receivers. Our findings reveal that signal detection of atomic MIMO receivers corresponds to a non-linear biased phase retrieval (PR) problem, as opposed to the linear Gaussian model adopted in classical MIMO systems. Then, to recover signals from this non-linear model, we modify the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, a typical PR solver, into a biased GS algorithm to solve the biased PR problem. Moreover, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization GS (EM-GS) algorithm to cope with the unique Rician distribution of the biased PR model. Our EM-GS algorithm introduces a high-pass filter constructed by the ratio of Bessel functions into the iteration procedure of GS, thereby improving the detection accuracy without sacrificing the computational efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of the devised algorithms and the feasibility of atomic MIMO receivers are demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.}

	abstract = {Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an effective approach to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and three-dimensional (3D) rotations of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the users’ spatial distribution and statistical channel information. Although continuously positioning/rotating 6DMA surfaces can achieve the greatest flexibility and thus the highest capacity improvement, it is difficult to implement due to the discrete movement constraints of practical stepper motors. Thus, in this paper, we consider a 6DMA-aided base station (BS) with only a finite number of possible discrete positions and rotations for the 6DMA surfaces. We aim to maximize the average sum rate for random numbers of users at random locations by jointly optimizing the 3D positions and 3D rotations of multiple 6DMA surfaces at the BS subject to discrete movement constraints. In particular, we consider the practical cases with and without statistical channel knowledge of the users, and propose corresponding offline and online optimization algorithms, by leveraging the Monte Carlo and conditional sample mean (CSM) methods, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed offline and online algorithms for discrete position/rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces as compared to various benchmark schemes with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), fluid antennas, and 6DMAs with limited movability. It is shown that 6DMA-BS can significantly enhance wireless network capacity, even under discrete position/rotation constraints, by exploiting the spatial distribution characteristics of the users.}

To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.}

In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential of employing rate-splitting multiple access to enhance the achievable rate and energy efficiency (EE) of an uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where the access points (APs) are configured with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to minimize the hardware expense and power consumption. Taking the large-scale fading decoding, ADC quantization, and imperfect successive interference cancellation into consideration, a rigorous closed-form rate expression is derived within Ricean fading environments. This analytical framework facilitates an in-depth analysis of the rate performance with respect to various system parameters. To quantify the benefits of low-resolution ADCs, a power consumption model is subsequently incorporated into the analysis, facilitating an evaluation of the system’s EE. Furthermore, the optimization of power control coefficients and receiver weights is tackled through the formulation of weighted sum-rate (WSR) and EE maximization problems. Two efficient alternative algorithms are then proposed to determine their optimal solutions. The theoretical propositions and the efficacy of the proposed WSR and EE optimization algorithms are substantiated through comprehensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Recently, the decentralized baseband processing (DBP) paradigm and relevant uplink detection methods have been proposed to enable extremely large-scale massive multiple-input multiple-output technology. Under the DBP architecture, base station antennas are divided into several independent clusters, each connected to a local computing fabric. However, current detection methods tailored to DBP only consider ideal white Gaussian noise scenarios, while in practice, the noise is often colored due to interference from neighboring cells. Moreover, in the DBP architecture, linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detection methods require the knowledge of noise covariance matrix which must be estimated using distributedly stored noise samples. This presents a significant challenge for decentralized LMMSE-based equalizer design. To address this issue, this paper proposes decentralized LMMSE equalization methods under colored noise scenarios for both star and daisy chain DBP architectures. Specifically, we first propose two decentralized equalizers for the star DBP architecture based on dimensionality reduction techniques. Then, we derive an optimal decentralized equalizer using the block coordinate descent method for the daisy chain DBP architecture with a bandwidth reduction enhancement scheme based on decentralized low-rank decomposition. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve excellent detection performance while requiring much less communication bandwidth.}

Based on the additive quantization noise model, we derive the detection error probability of the warden considering finite-resolution DACs. Aiming at maximizing the sum covert rate (SCR) between the transmitter and legitimate users, we design hybrid beamformers subject to power and covertness constraints. To solve this nonconvex joint optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme based on fractional programming, quadratic transformation, and inner majorization-minimization methods to iteratively optimize the analog and digital beamformers. To reduce the computational complexity of the AO scheme, we propose a vector-space based heuristic (VSH) scheme to design the hybrid beamformer. We prove that as the number of antennas grows to be infinity, the SCR in the VSH scheme can approach the channel mutual information. Simulation results show that the AO and VSH schemes outperform the existing schemes and the VSH scheme can be used to obtain an initialization for the AO scheme to speed up its convergence.}

	abstract = {Coordinated multi-base station (BS) transmission has emerged as a fundamental access technology to augment network capability and improve spectrum efficiency. However, the computation-intensive feedback of channel state information (CSI) poses significant challenges in determining physical-layer parameters for coordinated BSs. In this paper, we investigate a feedback-free mechanism that leverages fixed precoding matrix indicator (PMI), rank indicator (RI), and channel quality indicator (CQI) for coordinated BS transmission over a fully-decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN). Aiming to maximize user equipment (UE) throughput without CSI feedback, we calculate an optimal feedback-free parameter across spatial, frequency, and time domains only through UE geolocations. First, to determine MIMO transmission layer and precoding strategy in the spatial domain, we introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework to jointly select PMI and RI for coordinated BSs. Subsequently, for designing a more fine-grained subband transmission, transformer module is employed to capture the subcarrier correlations within OFDM symbols. Finally, given the unpredictable channel variations, we leverage a diffusion model to generate representative channel for fixed PMI, RI, and CQI over time-varied networks. Simulations demonstrate that 2 BSs feedback-free transmission can enhance 13% throughput compared with 1 BS CLSM transmission, which provides a design principle for next-generation transceiver technologies.}

	abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are both critical technologies for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. However, their interplay has yet to be explored. To obtain the mutual benefits between CR and ISAC, we focus on a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced cognitive ISAC system and explore using the additional degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) brought by the RIS to improve the performance of the cognitive ISAC system. Specifically, we mathematically prove that the position error bound (PEB) of each mobile sensor (MS) decreases with the increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signals at each MS. We also formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios (SINRs) of the MSs while ensuring the requirements of the spectrum sensing (SS) and the secondary transmissions by jointly designing the SS time, the secondary base station (SBS) beamforming, and the RIS beamforming. The formulated non-convex problem can be solved by the proposed block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the Dinkelbach’s transform and the successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Simulation results demonstrate that all the proposed iterative algorithms converge fast, and the SINRs of MSs can be effectively enhanced by increasing the transmit power of the SBS, the number of MS antennas, and the number of RIS elements. Moreover, higher MS SINRs lead to lower PEBs of MSs, thereby having the potential to improve the accuracy of radio environment map (REM) for CR networks. Additionally, the RIS needs to be deployed near the SBS or MSs to guarantee the performance gain brought by the RIS.}

	abstract = {To achieve stringent performance requirements in next generation wireless networks, such as ultra-high data rates, ubiquitous connectivity, and extremely high reliability, this paper proposes a radically novel rate splitting assisted dual-polarized stacked metasurface (RS-DPSM) transceiver architecture. In this architecture, a multi-layer dual-polarized metasurface is stacked at the active antennas and its two inherent polarizations are implemented to enable RS’s common and private messages in parallel. In sharp contrast to the conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and metasurface-based transceiver designs, our proposed transceiver is capable of enhancing the channel capacity and introducing multi-dimensional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the power, spatial, and polarization domains, thus enabling multi-functional, broad-spectrum, and all-time/domain/space communications without requiring massive radio-frequency (RF) chains. In addition, we derive new analytical expressions for the upper bounds of RS-DPSM transceiver’s channel capacity and ergodic sum rate, and provide some key insights. To highlight its potential benefits, we apply the proposed RS-DPSM transceiver to anti-jamming communications, and formulate a generalized sum rate maximization problem under the jammer’s imperfect angular channel state information and unknown cross-polarization discrimination. To enable an efficient resource management under the above practical conditions, we present a low-complexity optimization framework by leveraging the discretization method, properties of the quadratic function, reduced-majorization-minimization algorithm, and block successive upper-bound minimization, which admit the semi-closed-form solutions. Finally, our numerical simulations verify the superiority of our proposed transceiver architecture and optimization framework over key benchmarks.}

	abstract = {This work explores combining the rate-splitting multiple-access (RSMA) technique with an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to improve the quantized multiuser multiple-input single-output network. The active RIS facilitates communication between the base station (BS) and users equipped with low-resolution quantizers, whereas RSMA improves downlink transmission efficiency. By maximizing the spectral efficiency while minimizing the power consumption at the transmitter and active RIS, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem by jointly designing the BS precoding matrix and active RIS reflecting matrix. The optimization problem presents nonconvexity, which makes finding the optimal solution challenging. Therefore, we reformulate the problem into a reinforcement learning-based problem that is solvable by applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. To ensure action accuracy, we design a constraint-matching function that integrates with the DRL algorithm, forming a DRL framework securing all problem constraints. To assess the proposed DRL algorithm, we propose an alternating-based solution that decomposes the problem into precoding matrix optimization and active reflecting matrix optimization sub-problems, which are solvable using the successive convex approximation-based method. The performance evaluations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed approaches in various scenarios.}

	abstract = {The deployment of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhances the propagation environment by improving channel quality, but it also complicates channel estimation. Following the conventional wireless communication system design, which involves full channel state information (CSI) acquisition followed by RIS configuration, can reduce transmission efficiency due to substantial pilot overhead and computational complexity. This study introduces an innovative approach that integrates CSI acquisition and RIS configuration, leveraging the channel-altering capabilities of the RIS to reduce both the overhead and complexity of CSI acquisition. The focus is on multi-RIS-assisted systems, featuring both direct and reflected propagation paths. By applying a fast-varying reflection sequence during RIS configuration for channel training, the complex problem of channel estimation is decomposed into simpler, independent tasks. These fast-varying reflections effectively isolate transmit signals from different paths, streamlining the CSI acquisition process for both uplink and downlink communications with reduced complexity. In uplink scenarios, a positioning-based algorithm derives partial CSI, informing the adjustment of RIS parameters to create a sparse reflection channel, enabling precise reconstruction of the uplink channel. Downlink communication benefits from this strategically tailored reflection channel, allowing effective CSI acquisition with fewer pilot signals. Simulation results highlight the proposed methodology’s ability to accurately reconstruct the reflection channel with minimal impact on the normalized mean square error while simultaneously enhancing spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has attracted increasing attention due to its capability of overcoming signal blockages in visible light communication (VLC), an emerging technology for the next-generation advanced transceivers. However, current works on OIRS predominantly assume known channel state information (CSI), while its estimation problem has not been studied yet. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes a new and customized OIRS channel estimation protocol with joint space-time sampling under the alignment-based OIRS channel model. First, we unveil the spatial and temporal coherence characteristics and derive OIRS coherence distance and coherence time in closed form. Next, to achieve dynamic beam alignment for pilot transmission within the coherence time, we propose to tune the rotation angles of the OIRS reflecting elements following a geometric optics-based non-uniform codebook. Then, given the beam alignment within the considered coherence time, a sequential OIRS channel estimation method is proposed, where the OIRS is divided into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance. The CSI for each subarray is estimated sequentially, followed by a space-time interpolation to retrieve full CSI for other non-aligned transceiver antennas. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OIRS channel estimation protocol as compared to benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Energy efficiency (EE) optimization has attracted significant research attention for implementing green communications. With cost-effective and low-power advantages, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and hybrid analog-digital transceiver have recently emerged as two promising technologies of next-generation green wireless systems. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for EE optimization in four types of IRS-aided hybrid analog-digital multiuser multiple-input multiple-output communication systems, including the uplink (UL) systems under the sum power and box eigenvalue constraints as well as the per-radio-frequency chain power constraints (PRPCs), and the downlink (DL) systems under the sum power constraint and the PRPCs. This framework proposes a unified design methodology to these four considered systems by separating the optimization of analog and digital matrix variables. Specifically, for the UL EE maximization problems, we firstly propose a channel alignment based algorithm to separately optimize the analog precoders at users, the analog combiner at the base station and the IRS reflecting matrix, whose computational complexity is significantly reduced as compared with the traditional alternating optimization algorithm. Then, by introducing the auxiliary variables and exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions based algorithm, the optimal digital precoders at users are obtained in closed forms. Furthermore, the intractable DL EE optimization can be equivalently transformed into its virtual UL counterpart using the DL-UL duality, leading to the general applicability of the proposed framework. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm attains the almost identical EE performance to the traditional benchmarks with a lower computational complexity.}

Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ABEP of the TRIS-SM scheme, as well as the diversity gain. To improve the performance of the proposed TRIS-SM system, we optimize ABEP with a fixed data rate. Additionally, we provide lower bounds to simplify the computational complexity of improved TRIS-SM scheme. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to validate the theoretical derivations exhaustively. The results demonstrate that the proposed TRIS-SM scheme can achieve better ABEP performance compared to the conventional SM scheme. Furthermore, the improved TRIS-SM scheme outperforms the TRIS-SM scheme in terms of reliability.}

	abstract = {The following paper presents a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system model scenario, where a base station communicates with a user, and a bi-static sensing unit, i.e. the passive radar (PR), senses targets using downlink signals. Given that the RIS aids with communication and sensing tasks, this paper introduces new interfering paths that can overwhelm the PR with unnecessarily high power, namely the path interference (PI), which is itself a combination of two interfering paths, the direct path interference (DPI) and the reflected path interference (RPI). For this, we formulate an optimization framework that allows the system to carry on with its ISAC tasks, through analog space-time beamforming at the sensing unit, in collaboration with RIS phase shift and statistical transmit covariance matrix optimization, while minimizing the PI power. As the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we tailor a block-cyclic coordinate descent (BCCD) method to decouple the non-convex sub-problem from the convex one. A Riemannian conjugate gradient method is devised to generate the RIS and PR space-time beamforming phase shifts per BCCD iteration, while the convex sub-problem is solved via off-the-shelf solvers. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solver when compared with benchmarking ones.}

To tackle this challenge, leveraging the error-correcting capability of channel codes, we incorporate channel coding theory into beam training to enhance the training accuracy, thereby extending the coverage area. Specifically, we establish the duality between hierarchical beam training and channel coding, and build on it to propose a general coded beam training framework. Then, we present two specific implementations exemplified by coded beam training methods based on Hamming codes and convolutional codes, during which the beam encoding and decoding processes are refined respectively to better accommodate to the beam training problem.

	abstract = {How to reduce the pilot overhead required for channel estimation? How to deal with the channel dynamic changes and error propagation in channel prediction? To jointly address these two critical issues in next-generation transceiver design, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named channel deduction for high-dimensional channel acquisition in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, it makes use of the outdated channel information of past time slots, performs coarse estimation for the current channel with a relatively small number of pilots, and then fuses these two information to obtain a complete representation of the present channel. The rationale is to align the current channel representation to both the latent channel features within the past samples and the coarse estimate of current channel at the pilots, which, in a sense, behaves as a complementary combination of estimation and prediction and thus reduces the overall overhead. To fully exploit the highly nonlinear correlations in time, space, and frequency domains, we resort to learning-based implementation approaches. By using the highly efficient complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-mixer for across-space-frequency-domain representation and the recurrence-based or attention-based mechanisms for the past-present interaction, we respectively design two different channel deduction neural networks (CDNets). We provide a general procedure of data collection, training, and deployment to standardize the application of CDNets. Comprehensive experimental evaluations in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, which reduces the pilot overhead by up to 88.9% compared to state-of-the-art estimation approaches and enables continuous operating even under unknown user movement and error propagation.}

	abstract = {Due to the exponential increase in wireless devices and a diversification of network services, unprecedented challenges, such as managing heterogeneous data traffic and massive access demands, have arisen in next-generation wireless networks. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for the evolution of multiple access schemes with advanced transceivers. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication emerges as a promising solution by offering substantial bandwidth and accommodating massive connectivities. Nevertheless, the inherent signaling directionality and susceptibility to blockages pose significant challenges for deploying multiple transceivers with narrow antenna beams. Consequently, beam management becomes imperative for practical network implementations to identify and track the optimal transceiver beam pairs, ensuring maximum received power and maintaining high-quality access service. In this context, we propose a Contextual Combinatorial Beam Management (CCBM) framework tailored for mmWave wireless networks. By leveraging advanced online probing techniques and integrating predicted contextual information, such as dynamic link qualities in spatial-temporal domain, CCBM aims to jointly optimize transceiver pairing and beam selection while balancing the network load. This approach not only facilitates multiple access effectively but also enhances bandwidth utilization and reduces computational overheads for real-time applications. Theoretical analysis establishes the asymptotically optimality of the proposed approach, complemented by extensive evaluation results showcasing the superiority of our framework over other state-of-the-art schemes in multiple dimensions.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming is vital in modern wireless systems, especially for massive MIMO and millimeter-wave (mmWave) deployments, offering efficient directional transmission with reduced hardware complexity. However, effective beamforming in multi-user scenarios relies heavily on accurate channel state information, the acquisition of which often requires significant pilot overhead, degrading system performance. To address this and inspired by the spatial congruence between sub-6GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels, we propose a Sub-6G information Aided Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming (SA-MUHBF) framework, avoiding excessive use of pilots at mmWave. SA-MUHBF employs a convolutional neural network to predict mmWave beamspace from sub-6G channel estimate, followed by a novel multi-layer graph neural network for analog beam selection and a linear minimum mean-square error algorithm for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that SA-MUHBF efficiently predicts the mmWave beamspace representation and achieves superior spectrum efficiency over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, SA-MUHBF demonstrates robust performance across varied sub-6G system configurations and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.}

	abstract = {With gigahertz-level bandwidth, terahertz (THz) holds promise for achieving exceptionally high transmission rates in prospective sixth-generation (6G) communications. However, considerable path loss poses an obstacle to THz communications. To compensate for this, massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) based beamforming is utilized to promote directional power with narrow beams in communications. In dynamic environments, the frequent adjustment of narrow beams results in fast time-varying channel state information (CSI), which constrains the application of the THz communication systems. While traditional deterministic-based and statistical-based channel tracking methods address different aspects of this issue, they suffer from balancing accuracy and complexity in the THz dynamic environments. To solve this problem, based on the cluster distribution of THz time-varying channel, we propose a novel hybrid channel tracking method that uses deterministic physical motion variation law to extract the cluster subspace, and then statistical Markov evolution models are applied within it. To achieve this, an integrated clustering and estimation method, clustering subspace matching pursuit (CSMP) is proposed for obtaining the channel clusters prior knowledge. Then based on above hybrid tracking method design, we propose a virtual cluster subspace turbo-approximate message passing (VCS-TAMP). Finally, several simulation results validate that our proposal achieves great improvement in both accuracy and computational time performance.}

True-time-delayers (TTDs) are utilized to generate frequency-dependent radar rainbow beams by controlling the beam squint effect. These beams cover users across the entire angular space simultaneously for fast beam training using just one orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol. Three detection and estimation schemes are proposed based on radar rainbow beams for estimation of the users’ directions, distances, and velocities, which are then exploited for communication beamformer design. The first proposed scheme utilizes a single-antenna radar receiver and one set of rainbow beams, but may cause a Doppler ambiguity. To tackle this limitation, two additional schemes are introduced, utilizing two sets of rainbow beams and a multi-antenna receiver, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed detection and estimation schemes are extended to realize user tracking by choosing different subsets of OFDM subcarriers. This approach eliminates the need to switch phase shifters and TTDs, which is typically required for existing tracking schemes. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed rainbow beam-based training and tracking methods for mobile users.}

	abstract = {The massive-antenna wideband millimeter wave (mmWave)/terahertz (THz) systems inevitably suffer from a severe beam split effect due to the non-negligible signal propagation delays, which dramatically reduces communication efficiency. Nevertheless, if the wideband split effect is properly utilized, it can also bring benefits via sensing split directions for channel training. Hence, this paper proposes a novel wideband beam alignment framework with true-time-delayer (TTD) modules, which can fully exploit the controllable split beams for efficient angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) estimation. Moreover, we develop a hierarchical posterior matching (PM) enabled wideband beam alignment approach, which proactively configures the split beams to accelerate the estimation of AoAs posterior probability distributions. To deal with the computational complexity of the predesigned codebook and the insensitivity of the Gaussian distribution assumption in PM, we further introduce a low-complex and high-flexible wideband beam alignment approach based on a deep unfolding mechanism. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can significantly improve the AoAs estimation accuracy at the cost of the same pilot overheads. 2) The proposed low-complexity deep unfolding approach outperforms the conventional PM mechanism even in low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) scenarios.}

In this paper, we focus on the design of robust index modulation (IM) schemes under the multiple-antenna AFDM transmission framework. To this end, the cyclic delay diversity (CDD) technique is employed to harvest the transmit diversity gain. As a result, we propose two novel AFDM-IM schemes with transmit diversity, termed as CDD-AFDM-IM-I and CDD-AFDM-IM-II. We analyze the full diversity conditions and parameter settings of the proposed CDD-AFDM-IM schemes for both integer and fractional Doppler cases over linear time-varying (LTV) channels. Moreover, we prove that IM enables AFDM to have stronger diversity protection when the full diversity condition is not satisfied. Asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection are derived in closed-form. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity double-layer message passing (DLMP) algorithm for practical large-dimensional signal detection in the proposed CDD-AFDM-IM systems. Comparison with existing detections shows that the proposed DLMP algorithm achieves a better tradeoff between the BER performance and the computational complexity. Finally, BER simulation results confirm that our proposed CDD-AFDM-IM schemes with both the ML and DLMP detections outperform the benchmark schemes over the LTV channels.}

This paper considers the advanced waveform design for hardware-efficient massive MIMO DFRC systems. Specifically, the transmit waveform is imposed with the quantized constant-envelope (QCE) constraint, which facilitates the employment of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and power-efficient amplifiers. The waveform design problem is formulated as the minimization of the mean square error (MSE) between the designed and desired beampatterns subject to the constructive interference (CI)-based communication quality of service (QoS) constraints and the QCE constraint. To solve the formulated problem, we first utilize the penalty technique to transform the discrete problem into an equivalent continuous penalty model. Then, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm for solving the penalty model. In particular, the ALM subproblem at each iteration is solved by a custom-built block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm, which admits closed-form updates, making the proposed inexact ALM algorithm computationally efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art ones. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to examine the impact of various system parameters on the trade-off between communication and radar performances.}

	abstract = {A wiretap channel is served as the fundamental model of physical layer security techniques, where the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel is proven to be achieved by Gaussian input. However, there remains a gap between the Gaussian secrecy capacity and the secrecy rate with conventional uniformly distributed discrete constellation input, e.g. amplitude shift keying (ASK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic shaped multilevel polar coding scheme to bridge the gap. Specifically, the input distribution optimization problem for maximizing the secrecy rate with ASK/QAM input is solved. Numerical results show that the resulting sub-optimal solution can still approach the Gaussian secrecy capacity. Then, we investigate the polarization of multilevel polar codes for the asymmetric discrete memoryless wiretap channel, and thus propose a multilevel polar coding scheme integration with probabilistic shaping. It is proved that the scheme can achieve the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel with discrete constellation input, and satisfies the reliability condition and weak security condition. A security-oriented polar code construction method to natively satisfies the leakage-based security condition is also investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves more efficient and secure transmission than the uniform constellation input case over both the Gaussian wiretap channel and the Rayleigh fading wiretap channel.}

This decoder operates identically to conventional NMS decoders, but is trained by novel training methods including: i) boosting learning with uncorrected vectors, ii) block-wise training schedule to address the vanishing gradient issue, iii) dynamic weight sharing to minimize the number of trainable weights, iv) transfer learning to reduce the required sample count, and v) data augmentation to expedite the sampling process. Leveraging these training strategies, the boosted NMS decoder achieves the state-of-the art performance in reducing the error floor as well as superior waterfall performance. Remarkably, we fulfill the 6G xURLLC requirement for 5G LDPC codes without a severe error floor. Additionally, the boosted NMS decoder, once its weights are trained, can perform decoding without additional modules, making it highly practical for immediate application.

Specifically, we first conceive new source-constrained (SC) coding scheme and inter-layer-cascaded (ILC) decoding scheme tailored for the HM-based transmitter and receiver, respectively. Both the proposed SC coding and ILC decoding schemes form an enhanced version of bit-interleaved-coded HM (BIC-HM) systems, namely source-constrained HM (SC-HM) systems, providing a more reliable and flexible multi-data transmission solution. Moreover, according to the SC coding principle, we conceive a novel variable-node-degree-based (VND) multiplexing scheme to further improve the performance of the proposed SC-HM systems. Additionally, based on the ILC decoding framework, we devise a novel mutual information (MI) analysis tool, namely ILC-based extrinsic-information-transfer (ILC-EXIT) algorithm, to predict the decoding thresholds of the proposed P-LDPC-coded SC-HM systems. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-HM systems significantly outperform the existing benchmarks in terms of error performance, decoding latency, and transmission-rate adaptation.}

	abstract = {We introduce deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) schemes for image transmission over cooperative relay channels. The relay either amplifies-and-forwards its received signal, called DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features from its received signal, called DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). We consider both half- and full-duplex relays, and propose a novel transformer-based model at the relay. For a half-duplex relay, it is shown that the proposed scheme learns to generate correlated signals at the relay and source to obtain beamforming gains. In the full-duplex case, we introduce a novel block-based transmission strategy, in which the source transmits in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal. To enhance practicality, a single transformer-based model is used at the relay at each block, together with an adaptive transmission module, which allows the model to seamlessly adapt to different channel qualities and the transmission powers. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepJSCC-PF compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, in both half- and full-duplex relay scenarios over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.}

However, the application of BP decoding for short codes is hindered by dense parity-check matrices (PCMs) and prevalent short cycles in the Tanner graph. In this paper, we introduce a general method to extract an optimized sparse PCM for short binary block codes, which removes length-four cycles and enhances the connectivity of short cycles to enable BP decoding with improved performance. Notably, for short binary codes with lengths up to 64, our BP decoding performance approaches the maximum likelihood bound and surpasses the best-reported BP results with reduced computational complexity. Compared with other universal decoding algorithms, BP decoding using our extracted sparse PCMs is competitive in terms of both error-rate performance and computational complexity. These promising results suggest that our method to improve BP decoding for short codes is a step toward a practical universal BP decoder for next-generation communication systems.}

	abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising non-orthogonal multiple access scheme for enabling massive connectivity in next generation wireless networks. However, current SCMA codebooks are designed with the same size, leading to inflexibility of user grouping and supporting diverse data rates. To address this issue, we propose a variable modulation SCMA (VM-SCMA) that allows users to employ codebooks with different modulation orders. To guide the VM-SCMA design, a VM matrix (VMM) that assigns modulation orders based on the SCMA factor graph is first introduced. We formulate the VM-SCMA design using the proposed average inverse product distance and the asymptotic upper bound of sum-rate, and jointly optimize the VMM, VM codebooks, power and codebook allocations. The proposed VM-SCMA not only enables diverse date rates but also supports different modulation order combinations for each rate. Leveraging these distinct advantages, we further propose an adaptive VM-SCMA (AVM-SCMA) scheme which adaptively selects the rate and the corresponding VM codebooks to adapt to the users’ channel conditions by maximizing the proposed effective throughput. Simulation results show that the overall designs are able to simultaneously achieve a high-level system flexibility, enhanced error rate results, and significantly improved throughput performance, when compared to conventional SCMA schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a multi-hop full-duplex (FD) relaying system that supports low-latency communication, and aim to explore the potential of FD technology in suppressing transmission latency. Specifically, we begin with a two-hop relaying system, where a source node is expected to transmit a large message to the destination node via a relaying node operating in FD mode. We assume the large message is equally divided into multiple smaller packets, while the whole transmission is operated in a packet-by-packet manner and retransmissions are scheduled against decoding failures. Notably, we have for the first time characterized the expected transmission latency while taking into account the finite blocklength (FBL) impact on transmission reliability. Through a proposed error probability propagation policy, we have recursively derived the expected number of transmissions required to successfully conveying the entire message via FD relaying system. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the expected transmission latency by jointly optimizing packet division, blocklength allocation, and transmit power control. To deal with the inherent nonconvexity of the problem, we reformulate it using variable substitution and subsequently construct a tight convex approximation based on an arbitrary feasible point. This facilitates an iterative algorithm that progressively refines the solution until convergence to a suboptimal point. The whole approach for latency characterization and minimization is then extended to the multi-hop relaying scenario. Finally, simulation results validate the convergence behaviours of our proposed algorithms and highlight the latency benefits of our solution compared to both half-duplex relaying and full-duplex relaying without optimal power control.}

	abstract = {Block Orthogonal Sparse Superposition (BOSS) codes are a promising class of joint coded modulation techniques that can closely approach the finite-blocklength capacity with low-complexity decoding at low code rates under Gaussian channels. However, in fading channels, the performance of BOSS codes degrades considerably due to varying channel fading effects on coded symbols. This paper presents a unified approach to extending BOSS codes to practical fading scenarios and introduces novel joint demodulation and decoding solutions. For fast-fading channels, we propose a minimum mean square error approximation maximum a posteriori (MMSE-A-MAP) algorithm that integrates demodulation and decoding when channel state information is available at the receiver (CSIR). Additionally, for block-fading channels without CSIR, we introduce a joint demodulation and decoding method, referred to as the non-coherent sphere decoding (NSD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that BOSS codes with MMSE-A-MAP decoding outperform 5G polar codes, while the NSD algorithm achieves performance comparable to quasi-maximum likelihood decoding but with significantly reduced complexity. Both decoding methods can be implemented for parallel processing, allowing them to meet low-latency requirements. Furthermore, real-time simulations on a software-defined radio testbed validate the feasibility of using BOSS codes for low-power transmission.}

For most common channel models, the optimal modulation schemes are known to require nonuniform probability distributions over signal points, which presents practical challenges. An established way to map uniform binary sources to non-uniform symbol distributions is to assign a different number of bits to different constellation points. Doing so, however, means that erroneous demodulation at the receiver can lead to bit insertions or deletions, turning a channel with Hamming-type errors into an insertion-deletion channel. The demodulator we propose provides error detection and correction through the use of a low-overhead padding bit sequence. We evaluate the performance of the proposed demodulator in various channel models and various communication settings. We verify that the demodulator successfully corrects the insertion-deletion errors. Using the proposed demodulator, we study different constellation design schemes and how they behave in different channel conditions. Overall, we observe considerable gains that suggest, in some circumstances, one may improve the throughput while keeping the error rate the same.}

	abstract = {Modern wireless systems face interference due to rising spectrum efficiency demands and increasingly aggressive network designs. Despite its optimality, the huge complexity of the maximum likelihood (ML) detection hinders its deployment in the future wireless communication systems, which require low latency and high energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop a novel generalized framework for data detection in interference channels. In particular, we factorize the joint likelihood function of the transmitted symbols to obtain the marginal distribution of a single symbol following the sum-product (SP) algorithm. Motivated by the fact that the complexity of the SP algorithm is dominated by the summation process, we introduce Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models to reduce the state space of symbols, which helps to reduce the detection complexity. The proposed hybrid detection framework consists of three kinds of symbol distributions, i.e., original discrete, Gaussian, and Gaussian mixture distributions. To strike a balance between complexity and error performance, we can simply modify the components of different symbol distributions, offering high flexibility in practical applications. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of our proposed detection scheme and discuss the design guidelines for the mixture Gaussian messages. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

First, we demonstrate that Power Blast, an analytical coding scheme inspired by Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) and Gallager-Nakiboğlu (GN) schemes, achieves notable reliability improvements over both SK and GN schemes, outperforming neural codes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Next, to enhance reliability in low-SNR regions, we propose Light Code, a lightweight neural code that achieves state-of-the-art reliability while using a fraction of memory and compute compared to existing deep-learning-based codes.

	abstract = {Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications, where semantic features of data are transmitted using artificial intelligence algorithms to attain high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding (D2-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive prior model is designed to encode semantic features according to their distributions. Second, channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates via the analysis of the Bayesian model and Lipschitz assumption on the DNNs. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, a two-step algorithm is proposed to control the source-channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms classic deep JSCC and mitigates the cliff and leveling-off effects, which commonly exist for separation-based approaches.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. This method is referred to as the MM-FP algorithm. Additionally, inspired by the semi-closed form solution, we also propose a low-complexity version of the MM-FP algorithm, called the low-complexity MM-FP (LP-MM-FP), which alleviates the need for iterative optimization of beamforming vectors. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MM-FP algorithm outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE). Moreover, the proposed LP-MMFP algorithm achieves comparable performance with the WMMSE algorithm but with lower computational complexity.}

The proposed system harnesses a multi-scale semantic extractor with a dual-branch design tailored for extracting semantics with varying granularity, thereby boosting the robustness of the system. The fine-grained branch incorporates a semantic importance evaluation module to identify and prioritize crucial semantics through self-attention score manipulations, while the coarse-grained branch adopts a hierarchical approach for progressively capturing the robust semantics. These two streams of semantics are seamlessly integrated via an advanced cross-attention-based semantic fusion module. Experimental results highlight the superior performance of DeepSC-RI under diverse channel conditions, across various levels of semantic impairment intensity, and in multiple tasks.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of end-to-end (E2E) design of learning and communication in a task-oriented semantic communication system. In particular, we consider a multi-device cooperative edge inference system over a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel, where multiple devices transmit extracted features to a server to perform a classification task. We formulate the E2E design of feature encoding, MIMO precoding, and classification as a conditional mutual information maximization problem. However, it is notoriously difficult to design and train an E2E network that can be adaptive to both the task dataset and different channel realizations. Regarding network training, we propose a decoupled pretraining framework that separately trains the feature encoder and the MIMO precoder, with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier employed at the server to generate the inference result. The feature encoder is pretrained exclusively using the task dataset, while the MIMO precoder is pretrained solely based on the channel and noise distributions. Nevertheless, we manage to align the pretraining objectives of each individual component with the E2E learning objective, so as to approach the performance bound of E2E learning. By leveraging the decoupled pretraining results for initialization, the E2E learning can be conducted with minimal training overhead. Regarding network architecture design, we develop two deep unfolded precoding networks that effectively incorporate the domain knowledge of the solution to the decoupled precoding problem. Simulation results on both the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets verify that the proposed method achieves significantly higher classification accuracy compared to various baselines.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose “SoundSpring”, a cutting-edge error-resilient audio transceiver that marries the robustness benefits of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) while also being compatible with current digital communication systems. Unlike recent deep JSCC transceivers, which learn to directly map audio signals to analog channel-input symbols via neural networks, our SoundSpring adopts the layered architecture that delineates audio compression from digital coded transmission, but it sufficiently exploits the impressive in-context predictive capabilities of large language (foundation) models. Integrated with the casual-order mask learning strategy, our single model operates on the latent feature domain and serve dual-functionalities: as efficient audio compressors at the transmitter and as effective mechanisms for packet loss concealment at the receiver. By jointly optimizing towards both audio compression efficiency and transmission error resiliency, we show that mask-learned language models are indeed powerful contextual predictors, and our dual-functional compression and concealment framework offers fresh perspectives on the application of foundation language models in audio communication. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish that SoundSpring apparently outperforms contemporary audio transmission systems in terms of signal fidelity metrics and perceptual quality scores. These new findings not only advocate for the practical deployment of SoundSpring in learning-based audio communication systems but also inspire the development of future audio semantic transceivers.}

The ASIC simultaneously addresses the high throughput requirements for millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, stringent area and power budget per subcarrier in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and error-rate performance challenges posed by realistic mmWave channels. The proposed GBCD algorithm utilizes a posterior mean estimate (PME) denoiser and is optimized using deep unfolding, which results in superior error-rate performance even in scenarios with highly correlated channels or where the number of user equipment (UE) data streams is comparable to the number of basestation (BS) antennas. The fabricated GBCD ASIC supports up to 16 UEs transmitting QPSK to 256-QAM symbols to a 128-antenna BS, and achieves a peak throughput of 7.1Gbps at 367mW. The core area is only 0.97mm2 thanks to a reconfigurable array of processing elements that enables extensive resource sharing. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed GBCD data-detector ASIC achieves best-in-class throughput and area efficiency.}

We first construct a factor graph representation for the OTFS-based MIMO system according to the factorization of the a posteriori probability (APP). This representation establishes a direct probabilistic link between sensing and communication, allowing both functionalities to benefit from their integration. On this basis, we develop a low computational complexity message passing algorithm by minimizing the variational free energy associated with the global APP. In particular, belief propagation, mean field, and expectation maximization algorithms for data detection, channel coefficient estimation, and kinematic parameter sensing are derived, respectively. To reduce the communication overhead for the implementation of ISAC algorithm, we propose a federated learning scheme for distributed kinematic parameter sensing. Specifically, by solving the sensing problem in different fashions, three federated learning modes are devised. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at low overhead is crucial for millimeter wave MIMO communications but is challenging in dynamic environments. In this work, we exploit the emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beamforming technique for concurrent CSI sensing and data transmission. Despite its low overhead, the corresponding ISAC transmit beamforming design faces a complex trade-off between CSI sensing accuracy and communication interference management. To address this, we formulate the beamforming design as an optimization problem minimizing the maximum Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of CSI sensing errors subject to the users’ worst-case communication rates under CSI errors. To efficiently solve the problem, we step-by-step propose three algorithms. The first algorithm is based on the semidefinite relaxation and successive convex optimization techniques, which can serve as a benchmark algorithm but suffers high computational complexity. To efficiently handle the worst-case objective and rate constraints, we propose a complexity-reduced algorithm based on the primal-dual optimization method and first-order min-max algorithm. Furthermore, we dismiss SDR and employ the block coordinate descent method combined with cheap gradient descent steps to achieve a low-complexity algorithm. Extensive simulations show the proposed ISAC beamforming design and low-complexity algorithms can provide robust communication performance and significantly outperform existing schemes.}

This paper investigates a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system within 6G perceptive networks, where the base station actively senses the targets through device-free wireless sensing and simultaneously transmits the estimated information to end-users. In such a CAS system, we first establish an optimal waveform design framework based on the rate-distortion (RD) and source-channel separation (SCT) theorems. After analyzing the relationships between the sensing distortion, coding rate, and communication channel capacity, we propose two distinct waveform design strategies in the scenario of target impulse response estimation. In the separated S&C waveforms scheme, we equivalently transform the original problem into a power allocation problem and develop a low-complexity one-dimensional search algorithm, shedding light on a notable power allocation tradeoff between the S&C waveform. In the dual-functional waveform scheme, we conceive a heuristic mutual information optimization algorithm for the general case, alongside a modified gradient projection algorithm tailored for the scenarios with independent sensing sub-channels. Additionally, we identify the presence of both subspace tradeoff and water-filling tradeoff in this scheme. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.}

In this paper, we not only overcome but also harness the HFBS effect to propose an integrated location sensing and communication (ILSC) framework. During the uplink training stage, user terminals (UTs) transmit reference signals for simultaneous channel estimation and location sensing. This stage leverages an elaborately designed hybrid-field projection matrix to overcome the HFBS effect and estimate the channel in compressive manner. Subsequently, the scatterers’ locations can be sensed from the spherical wavefront based on the channel estimation results. By treating the sensed scatterers as virtual anchors, we employ a weighted least-squares approach to derive the UT’s location. Moreover, we propose an iterative refinement mechanism, which utilizes the accurately estimated time difference of arrival (TDoA) of multipath components to enhance location sensing precision. In the following downlink data transmission stage, we leverage the acquired location information to further optimize the hybrid beamformer, which combines the beam broadening and focusing to mitigate the spectral efficiency degradation resulted from the HFBS effect. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed ILSC scheme has superior location sensing and communication performance than conventional methods.}

However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements. Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision. Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference. Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency. Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, MA scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints. Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints. Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.}

The proposed algorithm is a least mean square (LMS)-like algorithm derived on the basis of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework and consists of an iterative filtering process and filter tap update process. The filtering process is implemented in the frequency domain using the overlap-save technique and the filter update process is a gradient descent-based algorithm which tries to minimize the mean squared error of the equalizer output. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm increases in proportion to the number of iterations and is the same as that of conventional LMS-based MIMO equalization when the number of iterations is one. We evaluate, through simulations, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed algorithm for a coupled multi-core fiber channel model with significant MDL. The simulation results show that increasing the number of iterations improves the BER performance significantly compared to the conventional LMS-based equalization algorithm. The proposed algorithm offers a good tradeoff between BER performance and computational complexity and enhances the MDL tolerance for SDM systems.}

	abstract = {Utilizing the multi-dimensional (MD) space for constellation shaping has been proven to be an effective approach for achieving shaping gains. Despite there exists a variety of MD modulation formats tailored for specific optical transmission scenarios, there remains a notable absence of a dependable comparison method for efficiently and promptly re-evaluating their performance in arbitrary transmission systems. In this paper, we introduce an analytical nonlinear interference (NLI) power model-based shaping gain estimation method to enable a fast performance evaluation of various MD modulation formats in coherent dual-polarization (DP) optical transmission system. In order to extend the applicability of this method to a broader set of modulation formats, we extend the established NLI model to take the 4D joint distribution into account and thus able to analyze the complex interactions of non-iid signaling in DP systems. With the help of the NLI model, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art modulation formats and investigate their actual shaping gains in two types of optical fiber communication scenarios (multi-span and single-span). The numerical simulation shows that for arbitrary modulation formats, the NLI power and relative shaping gains in terms of signal-to-noise ratio can be more accurately estimated by capturing the statistics of MD symbols. Furthermore, the proposed method further validates the effectiveness of the reported NLI-tolerant modulation format in the literature, which reveals that the linear shaping gains and modulation-dependent NLI should be jointly considered for nonlinearity mitigation.}

	abstract = {For applications in concatenated coding for optical communications systems, we examine soft-demapping of short spherical codes constructed as constant-energy shells of the Cartesian power of pulse amplitude modulation constellations. These are unions of permutation codes having the same average power. We construct a list decoder for permutation codes by adapting Murty’s algorithm, which is then used to determine mutual information curves for these permutation codes. In the process, we discover a straightforward expression for determining the likelihood of large subcodes of permutation codes. We refer to these subcodes, obtained by all possible sign flips of a given permutation codeword, as orbits. We introduce a simple process, which we call orbit demapping with frozen symbols, that allows us to extract soft information from noisy permutation codewords. In a sample communication system with probabilistic amplitude shaping protected by a standard low-density parity-check code that employs short permutation codes, we demonstrate that orbit demapping with frozen symbols provides a gain of about 0.3 dB in signal-to-noise ratio compared to the traditional symbol-by-symbol demapping. By using spherical codes composed of unions of permutation codes, we can increase the input entropy compared to using permutation codes alone. In one scheme, we consider a union of a small number of permutation codes. In this case, orbit demapping with frozen symbols provides about 0.2 dB gain compared to the traditional method. In another scheme, we use all possible permutations to form a spherical code that exhibits a computationally feasible trellis representation. The soft information obtained using the BCJR algorithm outperforms the traditional symbol-by-symbol method by 0.1 dB. Overall, using the spherical codes containing all possible permutation codes of the same average power and the BCJR algorithm, a gain of 0.5 dB is observed compared with the case of using one permutation code with the symbol-by-symbol demapping.

	abstract = {Joint detection and decoding (JDD) achieves rates based on information theory but is too complex to implement for many channels with memory or nonlinearities. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, combined with multistage encoding at the transmitter, is a method that lets one use coded modulation for memoryless channels to approach JDD rates. A SIC-based receiver is presented to compensate for inter-channel interference in long-haul optical fiber links. Simulations for 1000 km of standard single-mode fiber with ideal distributed Raman amplification, single-polarization transmission, and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) modulation show that SIC attains the achievable information rates (AIRs) of JDD using surrogate channel models with correlated phase and additive noise (CPAN). Moreover, the AIRs of ring constellations are compared to those of CSCG modulation. Simulations show that 32 rings, 16 SIC-stages, and Gaussian message passing on the factor graph of the CPAN surrogate model achieve the JDD rates of CSCG modulation. The computational complexity scales in proportion to the number of SIC-stages, where one stage has complexity similar to separate detection and decoding.}

	abstract = {Optical eigenvalue transmission based on inverse scattering transform (IST) has been studied for one of approaches to overcome the Kerr nonlinearity limit in fiber optic communications. In the recent decade, several multilevel modulation schemes that are based on IST, such as 16-ary and 64-ary signals using on-off encoding and b-modulation of multieigenvalues, have been proposed. To increase the transmission capacity and extend the transmission distance, applications of machine learning-based approaches to IST-based transmission have been proposed and demonstrated. Another prospective approach to increase the transmission capacity and extend the transmission distance in fiber optic communication involves the application of soft-decision forward error correction (SD-FEC). However, the applicability of SD-FEC to eigenvalue-modulated signals has not yet been investigated in detail because the distribution of the received signal is complicated for IST-based transmissions. In this paper, we describe in detail the theory of optical eigenvalue transmission, including the design of multilevel eigenvalue-modulated signals and the effects of noise and scaring parameters (coefficients for normalization of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation). We explain why neural network (NN) demodulators are advantageous for eigenvalue transmission systems. Consequently, we propose a combination of NN-based demodulators and SD-FEC decoding. A multilabel NN-based demodulator is employed to compute the L-value from the received eigenvalue pattern at the receiver. For a 16-ary eigenvalue-modulated signal, the proposed method outperformed a combination of the Gaussian approximation and SD-FEC in the simulation. Moreover, the experimental results show successful operation with error-free transmission through a 3000-km optical fiber line. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate the applicability of SD-FEC to a 4096-ary eigenvalue-modulated signal. The experimental results indicate that an achievable transmission distance can be extended to 1200 km using the NN demodulator and SD-FEC.}

	abstract = {According to the Gaussian noise (GN) model, nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) in fiber depends on the signal power spectral density (PSD). Consequently, optimizing the PSD of the pulse that modulates data, as the main factor influencing the PSD of the launched signal into the fiber, can effectively minimize fiber NLIN. In this study, we first employ the calculus of variations to identify the optimal band-limited pulse PSD that minimizes fiber NLIN. Next, we add other communication requirements, such as zero inter-symbol interference (ISI) and fast decay over time, as constraints to our design problem. For this case, we develop a general pulse model and formulate the design problem as an optimization problem. By solving this optimization problem, we find the optimal pulse PSD that not only minimizes NLIN power in fiber but also meets practical requirements. We study the time-domain impact of the designed modulating pulse PSD on the launched signal properties to gain insights into the nonlinearity benefits we achieve. We further analytically demonstrate that our designed pulse has favorable properties for the Godard timing recovery method. Through extensive simulations using the split-step Fourier method on a fiber with typical parameters and considering practical transmitter/receiver limitations, we illustrate the superior system reach and achievable data rate of our optimized pulses compared to existing pulse shapes.}

This kind of receiver employs photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors with finite resolution and low-intensity local oscillator. As a figure of merit, we consider the mutual information for both single and double WH detection. At first, we consider a Gaussian input modulation, showing this scheme to be suboptimal with respect to the homodyne and double homodyne capacity, respectively. Thereafter, we investigate the performance of non-Gaussian modulation, by considering a Gamma distribution of the energy of the encoded pulses, and achieve an increase in the information rate with respect to the Gaussian case in all energy regimes. In particular, WH measurement outperforms the Shannon limit for homodyne/double homodyne detection in the photon-starved limit, albeit it does not beat neither the direct detection (DD) limit achieved with Gamma modulation, nor on-off keying (OOK) strategies, e.g. OOK-DD and OOK-Dolinar receiver.}

	abstract = {Coherent detection has emerged as a key technology for advancing passive optical networks (PON) beyond 100 Gbps per wavelength, due to its advantages over the intensity and direct-detection (IM/DD) approach, which was previously dominant in PON systems. In coherent PON architectures, the cost of the optical network unit (ONU) is substantial due to the complexity of its transceivers. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on simplifying the transmitters and receivers on the ONU side. Yet, simplifying the ONU transceiver introduces issues like reduced dynamic range and lower data rates. How to make a balance between the performance and the cost, particularly in terms of component complexity, represents a critical challenge for the advancement of coherent PON. Therefore, we propose and demonstrate a hybrid, multi-format, and flexible-rate bidirectional coherent PON system, supporting a compatible OLT and ONUs with different types of transceivers. ONUs are categorized into different tiers based on their performance and cost requirements, with transceivers of varying complexity allocated accordingly. As a demonstration of concept, we have successfully conducted experimental transmissions of 25-GBaud 4/16/64- quadrature-amplitude-modulation signals across 20-km fiber in a bidirectional setup, achieving data rates ranging from 50-Gbps to 300-Gbps. The low-end, middle-end, and high-end ONUs attain power budgets of 39/31/21 dB, 43/36/26 dB, and 40/33/23 dB, respectively. This architecture serves as an effective bridge from the current 50G IM/DD PON to the anticipated 200G coherent PON, meeting the varied requirements of users at different service levels.}

	abstract = {In underwater environment, wireless signal propagation is very challenging, and strongly affected by absorption- and scattering-induced attenuation losses. Optical wireless communications (OWC), due to huge bandwidths, can provide high data rates and medium propagation ranges, representing a viable technology for underwater scenarios. There are several statistical distributions that model the effect of underwater turbulence on OWC, and how to model the underwater OWC (UOWC) channel with higher accuracy is still a topic to investigate. In this paper, we investigate the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) for enhancing performance in underwater OWC systems. In this regard, we present a unified channel model for UOWC, working both for heterodyne and intensity modulated/direct detection (IM/DD) schemes. The analytical expressions of average bit-error-rate (BER), outage probability, and channel capacity are derived including the combined effect of (i) attenuation, (ii) turbulence, (iii) pointing error, and (iv) angle-of-arrival (AOA) fluctuations to ensure the comprehensive characterization of underwater optical wireless communication channel. To make the analysis and results more realistic, the practical scenarios and parameters are considered. The probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the underwater OWC channel are obtained analytically. Simulation results are presented for various parameters of underwater channel and communication systems. It is observed that the application of IRS remains as an important tool in terms of mitigating the overall fading effect caused by the combination of previous phenomena in underwater wireless channel. Also, the benefits of heterodyne detection over IM/DD is evinced.}

	abstract = {Recently, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has emerged to support the high data rate requirements of oceanic exploration. In this paper, we propose an accurate and closed-form UWOC channel model to understand the effects of dynamic ocean environment on optical signal propagation. The model takes into account the impairments induced by oceanic path-loss, oceanic turbulence, pointing error loss and link interruption due to angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations jointly. We further derive analytical expressions for various outage performance metrics. To boost the system robustness to dynamic ocean environment, we design a probabilistic shaping (PS)-based strategy with unipolar pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which maximizes the ergodic constellation constrained capacity. Furthermore, considering the limitation of computational resources in real ocean environment, we simplify the PS-based scheme to alleviate the problem. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the proposed channel model and the outage performance analysis. Moreover, the simplified PS-based unipolar M-PAM scheme is validated to be a promising solution for the development and deployment of high speed adaptive UWOC systems.}

The proposed method iteratively estimates the parameters of the Gamma-Gamma fading channel by minimizing the weighted sum of the moment differences, where these differences are obtained by employing from the first to fifth order moments. In particular, by updating each weight of the moment differences for every iteration, the proposed method simultaneously can give more accurate estimates of the parameters. Through computer simulations over a wide range of FSO channel conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing moment-based method in noisy environment, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios and for large values of the Rytov variances.}

To address these challenges, a UV NLoS scattering model incorporating an obstacle was investigated, where the obstacle’s orientation angle, coordinates, and geometric dimensions were taken into account to approach actual application environments. Then, a UV NLoS reflection model was developed combined with specific geometric diagrams. Further, a simplified single-scattering path loss model was proposed with a closed-form expression. Finally, the proposed models were validated by comparing them with the Monte-Carlo photon-tracing model, the exact single-scattering model, and the latest simplified single-scattering model. Numerical results show that the path loss curves obtained by the proposed models agree well with those attained by related NLoS models under identical parameter settings, and avoiding obstacles is not always a good option for UV NLoS communications. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed simplified model is superior to that of the existing simplified model for all kinds of transceiver FoV angles.}

There are two main types of optical communication technologies for relays: conventional optical relays, such as amplify-and-forward (AF)/decode-and-forward (DF) systems, and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-based relays, each facing significant challenges. To this end, this paper introduces a novel hybrid two-way free-space optical (FSO) relay system utilizing modulating retro-reflector (MRR) technology to address specific challenges in UAV-based optical communication. Unlike traditional amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay systems, which struggle with power consumption and IRS-based systems that suffer from sensitivity to angular fluctuations, the proposed MRR-based approach offers a strategic compromise. The proposed system combines MRR technology with conventional lens-based systems and network coding to enhance stability against UAV’s angular movements. Performance evaluations reveal that while the proposed MRR-based relay system offers significant advantages under conditions of high angular instability, it achieves comparable or superior performance relative to AF/DF and IRS-based systems within certain operational parameter ranges. This study thus advances the discussion on UAV-based relay solutions by offering an in-depth analysis of the proposed system’s application potential and its specific constraints.}

In this paper, we present a study that estimates the RF carrier frequency at which this occurs, referred to as the cross-over RF frequency. The results show that there exists a cross-over RF frequency above which the OW system outperforms the RF system in terms of BER, which under LED background light can be as low as a few hundreds of GHz. Different receivers and background lighting conditions are also considered. A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detector is shown to outperform an avalanche photodiode (APD) detector in this background light conditions, while the latter becomes superior in higher sunlight conditions emphasising the crucial need for an optical filter for the SiPM.}

	abstract = {The multiple-input-single-output (MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) under per-emitter peak-amplitude constraint arises in naturally indoor optical wireless communication (OWC) applications due to the availability of many luminaires and simple photo receivers. In this paper, we study the achievable rate region of the two-user peak-amplitude constrained MISO BC with the goal of increasing the rate region beyond the one achieved using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. To this end, a novel precoding scheme is proposed that combines a type of discrete-state dirty paper channel (DPC) studied recently and ZF precoding for the MISO BC, termed the DPC-ZF precoding. We derive the achievable rate region of the proposed precoding scheme, and compare it with the one achieved by ZF precoding numerically by simulating a two-user indoor OWC broadcasting system. Numerical results show a significant improvement in the achievable rate region through DPC-ZF precoding compared to ZF precoding, implying the existence of more powerful interference management schemes for OWC broadcasting.}

	abstract = {Satellite optical communications will revolutionize global high-speed connectivity. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of end-to-end (E2E) Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)-Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) systems to establish high-performance Earth-GEO links using a semi-analytical tool. We present a novel method to accurately compute the divergence of a truncated and obscured beam, typical of Cassegrain telescopes; this model is instrumental to optimize the beam divergence with Pointing Error (PE) and beam wander. The effects of beam wander, scintillation, and PE are first individually investigated to derive the required margins for different outage probabilities (OPs), followed by an assessment of Adaptive Optics (AO) benefits and limitations. Furthermore, we comprehensively assess the uplink and downlink systems, exploiting for the first time an innovative and fully analytical closed-form expression to describe the combined three statistical effects. Finally, the full system analysis is carried out in the challenging scenario of strong turbulence, at various elevation angles and OP targets. By considering both coherent and non-coherent systems adopted from fiber communications, we determine the transmitter power and the maximum achievable throughput.}

	abstract = {Light mainly propagates along a line-of-sight without the rich multipath scattering that can be exploited in radio frequency (RF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To ensure outage-free communication MIMO can nonetheless be used, provided that multiple ceiling nodes are spatially distributed. Angular-selective client nodes can to some extent, but not perfectly, separate spatial streams coming from different ceiling points. In addition, many optical wireless communication (OWC) links have a low-pass frequency response. Because of these properties, indoor distributed (D)-MIMO OWC differs in many aspects from RF links. This paper explores how OWC D-MIMO systems can best be operated. The optimization of how to spread power over spatial streams and frequencies comes to different settings than typically seen for radio. We evaluate algorithms by an analytical foundation and by simulation based on a commonly accepted channel model. We derive a simple criterion to select the number of spatial streams which can be used. This also can serve as a selector for switching between spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing transmission modes. Moreover, we derive a simple formula for how to best spread power among spatial streams. Besides theoretically optimum solutions, we propose a very-near-optimum algorithm that is highly efficient for practical systems in rapidly varying channels.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based visible light communication (VLC) is considered a promising technique for next generation high-speed wireless communications. The emerging optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) offers significant benefits to the NOMA-based VLC, since it can mitigate signal blockage issues of VLC and improve its performance by manipulating channel qualities of users. This paper investigates the enhancement of OIRS to the NOMA-based multi-cell VLC system and explores the resource allocation problem for the energy efficiency (EE) maximization. To this end, the channel gains of the system are discussed, considering both the line-of-sight and OIRS-reflected paths. Then, the system model of NOMA-based VLC is established and the optimization problem is formulated to maximize the overall EE of the system. Next, the original optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems, which are solved by the proposed algorithms iteratively. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the enhancement in EE achieved by OIRS, as well as the influence of key parameters on the system performance, which can offer insights on resource allocation for NOMA-based VLC systems with OIRS.}

	abstract = {In this paper, two techniques including uplink positioning and multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) singular value decomposition (SVD) beamforming are proposed and utilized to provide a novel physical layer security (PLS) scheme for visible light communication (VLC) systems, which much enhance the integrated location-sensing and data security strength. The paper first develops a closed-form mathematical model for ubiquitous uplink positioning using a single light-emitting diode with the trilateration algorithm, considering the field-of-view constraints due to the user’s optical transmitter and access point receivers. SVD in MIMO VLC is subsequently introduced to exploit the acquired user’s location to form a pair of public and private keys for secure data transfer over the physical medium. The proposed system performance is evaluated in terms of the root mean square positioning error   \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}} \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}}   and the achieved bit error rate (BER) for the uplink positioning and the downlink data transmission, respectively. Results show that the effective area of the photodiode significantly impacts   \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}} \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}}  , with smaller areas resulting in higher   \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}} \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}}  . It is also observed that the   \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}} \\varepsilon _{\\mathbb {X}}   directly relates to the strength of ambient light inducing noise in the system. However, the proposed uplink positioning is less prone to natural ambient light as compared to the traditional downlink visible light positioning. The BER analysis of the downlink data transmission shows that the proposed SVD-based PLS enhances the system’s confidentiality by significantly narrowing the communication zone area by over 90% in comparison to the zero-forcing beamforming scheme and achieves reasonable secrecy capacity.}

	abstract = {Visible Light Positioning and Communication (VLPC) is a promising candidate for implementing Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) in the unlicensed 400 THz to 800 THz band. The current Visible Light Positioning (VLP) systems mainly operate based on the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path. However, its accuracy is degraded by interferences from Non-LoS (NLoS) paths. Furthermore, in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems, the estimation of Channel State Information (CSI) also becomes challenging, when the optical channel becomes dispersive. Against this background, we propose a new VLPC scheme using Direct Current (DC) biased Optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (VLPC-DCO-OFDM), where OFDM-based sensing is applied for the sake of improving the resolution of the estimated Channel Impulse Response (CIRs) exploited for positioning functionality. The CIRs estimated by sensing are further exploited to provide enhanced CSI for communication data detection. Moreover, we propose a hybrid Radar-RSS based solution, where the conventional RSS-aided VLP method is invoked for the sake of refining OFDM radar. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed VLPC-DCO-OFDM scheme – which simultaneously supports the triple functionalities of illumination, bi-static sensing and communication – is capable of achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy and Giga-bits-per-second data rate.}

	abstract = {To accommodate ever-growing traffic, network operators are actively deploying high-degree reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) to build large-capacity optical networks. High-degree ROADM-based optical networks have multiple parallel fibers between ROADM nodes, requiring the adoption of ROADM nodes with a large number of inter-/intra-node components. However, this large number of inter-/intra-node optical components in high-degree ROADM networks increases the likelihood of multiple failures simultaneously, and calls for novel methods for accurate localization of multiple failed components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the problem of multi-failure localization for high-degree ROADM-based optical networks. To solve this problem, we first provide a description of the failures affecting both inter-/intra-node components, and we consider different deployments of optical power monitors (OPMs) to obtain information (i.e., optical power) to be used for automated multi-failure localization. Then, as our main and original contribution, we propose a novel method based on a rules-informed neural network (RINN) for multi-failure localization, which incorporates the benefits of both rules-based reasoning and artificial neural networks (ANN). Through extensive simulations and experimental demonstrations, we show that our proposed RINN algorithm can achieve up to around 20% higher localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms, incurring only around 4.14 ms of average inference time.}

	abstract = {The networking industry is offering new services leveraging recent technological advances in connectivity, storage, and computing such as mobile communications and edge computing. In this regard, extended reality, a term encompassing virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, can provide unprecedented user experience and pioneering service opportunities such as: live concerts, sports, and other events; interactive gaming and entertainment; immersive education, training, and demos. These services require high-bandwidth, low-latency, and reliable connections, and are supported by next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the vision of 6G mobile communication systems. In this work, we devise a novel scheme, called backup from different data centers with multicast and adaptive bandwidth provisioning, to admit reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth extended reality live streams in next-generation networks. We consider network services where contents are non-cacheable and investigate how backup services can be offered by different data centers with multicast and adaptive bandwidth provisioning. Our proposed service-provisioning scheme provides protection not only against link failures in the physical network but also against computing and storage failures in data centers. We develop scalable algorithms for the service-provisioning scheme and evaluate their performance on various complex network instances in a dynamic environment. Numerical results show that, compared to conventional service-provisioning schemes such as those seeking backup services from the same data center, our proposed service-provisioning scheme efficiently utilizes network resources, ensures higher reliability, and guarantees low latency; hence, it is highly suitable for extended reality live streams.}

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) techniques have been proposed for the autonomous operation and lifecycle management of next-generation optical networks. To fully utilize potential capacity and accommodate dynamic services, the DT must dynamically update in sync with deployed optical networks throughout their lifecycle, ensuring low-margin operation. This paper proposes a dynamic-updating DT for the lifecycle management of optical networks, employing a hybrid approach that integrates data-driven and physics-informed techniques for fiber channel modeling. This integration ensures both rapid calculation speed and high physics consistency in optical performance prediction while enabling the dynamic updating of critical physical parameters for DT. The lifecycle management of optical networks, covering accurate performance prediction at the network deployment and dynamic updating during network operation, is demonstrated through simulation in a large-scale network. Up to 100 times speedup in prediction is observed compared to classical numerical methods. In addition, the fiber Raman gain strength, amplifier frequency-dependent gain profile, and connector loss between fiber and amplifier on C and L bands can be simultaneously updated. Moreover, the dynamic-updating DT is verified on a field-trial C+L-band transmission link, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 1.4 dB for performance estimation post-device replacement. Overall, the dynamic-updating DT holds promise for driving the next-generation optical networks towards lifecycle autonomous management.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the performance of data-center networks (DCNs) has become crucial for advancing large-scale computing applications. Hence, to improve the throughput, energy-efficiency and latency of DCNs, people are trying to replace the electrical packet switching (EPS) based spine switches with optical circuit switching (OCS) based ones. In an OCS-based DCN, topology engineering (TPE) is the key operation to dynamically reconfigure its inter-pod topology for accommodating traffic with optimized resource utilization. TPE consists of two highly-correlated steps, i.e., optimizing the target physical inter-pod topology of the DCN based on a traffic matrix, and planning the procedure of OCS reconfiguration such that hitless transition can be achieved. In this paper, we study how to optimize the two steps jointly to efficiently accelerate the hitless reconfiguration of an OCS-based DCN. We formulate a mixed linear programming model (MILP) to solve the joint optimization exactly. Then, to solve the problem time-efficiently, we propose an approach that optimizes TPE design greedily according to various metrics to minimize the number of stages required in hitless reconfiguration for TPE. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposals and demonstrate their benefits over existing benchmark.}

	abstract = {Although optical circuit switch (OCS) based data center network (DCN) can offer high-bandwidth and low-power consumption interconnection for server blocks, it has slow reconfiguration speed and thus is not well-suited to handling highly bursty traffic. Despite several Valiant load-balancing (VLB) type algorithms designed to mitigate this mismatch, they cause notable residual traffic fluctuation, measured by second moment of traffic rate. This leads to a notable tail distribution of flow completion time (FCT). Thereby, this paper proposes a second-moment VLB (sVLB), leveraging the fact that all optical links from the same source rarely burst simultaneously. Different from previous VLB-type algorithms, sVLB utilizes spare capacity in the DCN for load balancing. Specifically, it offloads the bursty traffic from optical links to other intermediate blocks, employing only spare capacity on temporarily idle optical links, and these blocks subsequently route the bursty traffic to its destination. We introduce an sVLB-based framework, which additionally provides a suitable optical topology for sVLB to work with and a weight-based scheme to assist sVLB in intermediate block selection during bursty traffic offloading. Our qualitative assessment and extensive simulation demonstrate that the sVLB-based framework can smooth out the residual traffic fluctuation, thus outperforming existing strategies in normalized FCT.}

Though Clos networks are the theory for building scalable and cost-effective switching fabrics, the nonblocking conditions for flex-grid optical Clos networks without wavelength conversion remain unknown. This paper studies the nonblocking conditions for the flex-grid OXC-Clos network, which is constructed from a number of small-size standard OXCs. We first show that a strictly nonblocking (SNB) OXC-Clos network will incur a high cost, as small-granularity lightpaths may abuse central modules (CMs), rendering them unavailable for large-granularity requests due to frequency conflicts. Hence, we propose a granularity differential routing (GDR) strategy, the idea of which is to restrict the set of CMs that can be utilized by the lightpaths of each granularity. Under the GDR strategy, we investigate two system models, called granularity-port binding and unbinding models, and prove the wide-sense nonblocking (WSNB) conditions. We show that the cost of WSNB network is remarkably smaller than that of SNB network, and find that the granularity-port unbinding model can offer more flexible network-bandwidth utilization compared to the binding model, with a slight cost associated with switching fabrics.}

	abstract = {Network topology planning is an essential multi-phase process to build and jointly optimize the multi-layer network topologies in wide-area networks (WANs). Most existing practices target single-phase/layer planning, and are incapable of satisfying all rigorous topological structure constraints (e.g., dual-homing rings) defined by network standards and operators, especially in large-scale networks. These significantly limit their usability and performance in production networks. We consider a general topology planning problem with typical structure constraints over three essential phases (greenfield, reconfiguration, and site expansion) and topological layers (optical, IP, and routing topologies). We present, T3Planner, a novel practical solver to this problem in production. Specifically, we develop a structure-driven encoder based on graph neural network (GNN) for concise structure encoding, and design a new learning framework with optical-centric layer compression/reconstruction and rule-aided reinforcement learning (RL) for fast convergence and high performance. Extensive experiments on nine real topologies demonstrate that T3Planner scales to large optical networks with hundreds of sites, saves 46.6% cost, and supports   3.12\\times  3.12\\times    more demand when compared to related existing approaches.}

	abstract = {The extension of elastic optical network (EON) technologies to multi-band transmission (MB-EON) promises enhanced spectral efficiency, greater throughput, and long-term cost benefits for telecom operators. However, designing such networks presents challenges, particularly in optimizing physical parameters like optical power and quality of transmission (QoT) across different frequency bands. This paper introduces a methodology for optimal span-by-span power allocation using two hyper-accelerated power optimization (HPO) modes: flat launch power (FLP) and flat received power (FRP). This methodology significantly accelerate network power optimization while ensuring service stability in scenarios such as changes in network parameters, QoT degradation due to aging, and network re-optimization or upgrading. Through a comprehensive comparison, we find that FRP notably improves signal flatness and GSNR/OSNR, particularly in the S-band, contributing to a network-wide throughput increase in the order of 12% to 75%. Additionally, we demonstrate that HPO applied to global power optimization is simpler and more cost-effective than when applied to local methods for large-scale networks.}

	abstract = {Quantum networks (QNs) enable secure distributed quantum computing and sensing over next-generation optical communication networks by distributing entangled states over optical channels. However, quantum switches (QSs) in such QNs, which perform entanglement distribution, have limited resources, e.g., single-photon sources (SPSs) and quantum memories, which are sensitive to noise and losses. Efficient QS resource allocation is needed to minimize entanglement distribution delay. This paper proposes a QS resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes the average entanglement distribution delay and entanglement distillation operations to improve end-to-end (e2e) fidelity and meet user-specific rate and fidelity requirements. The proposed framework accounts for realistic QN noise and imperfections, deriving analytical expressions for quantum memory decoherence noise and resulting e2e fidelity after distillation. It also considers practical deployment factors, allowing QSs to control 1) nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center SPS types based on their isotopic decomposition, and 2) nuclear spin regions based on coupling strength and distance from NV center’s electron spin. The QS resource allocation optimization problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed framework manages to satisfy all users rate and fidelity requirements, unlike existing distillation-agnostic, minimal distillation, and physics-agnostic frameworks which do not perform distillation, perform minimal distillation, and do not control the physics-based NV center characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework results in significant reductions in the average e2e entanglement distribution delay, along with enhancements in the average e2e fidelity compared to the aforementioned existing frameworks.}

The efficiency of secure communication in a quantum network depends on both the topology of the network and the strategy of communication relays. In this paper, we propose a strategy to build a quantum network integrating various types of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) schemes. A cost optimization model is presented to measure the cost of transmitting secure messages in a quantum network. Within the model, two types of quantum network strategies, the quantum circuit switching strategy and the quantum packet switching strategy, are proposed and compared. Numerical simulations in a specific network show that the quantum packet switching strategy is more favorable in future quantum networks taking into account robustness and cost required when using different types of QSDC schemes.}

	abstract = {We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single broadband quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing and spectrum allocation scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. As our setting allows separately solving the routing and spectrum allocation problems, we first find an optimal polynomial-time routing algorithm. We then employ max-min fairness criterion for spectrum allocation, which presents an NP-hard problem. Thus, we focus on approximately-optimal schemes. We compare their performance by evaluating the max-min and median number of EPR-pair rates assigned by them, and the associated Jain index. We identify two polynomial-time approximation algorithms that perform well, or better than others under these metrics. We also investigate scalability by analyzing how the network size and connectivity affect performance using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves higher minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and computational resources are considered. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of the source node placement on the performance.}

	abstract = {The rapid development and usage of digital technologies in modern intelligent systems and applications bring critical challenges on data security and privacy. It is essential to allow cross-organizational data sharing to achieve smart service provisioning, while preventing unauthorized access and data leak to ensure end users’ efficient and secure collaborations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising pathway to enable innovative collaboration across multiple organizations. However, more stringent security policies are needed to ensure authenticity of participating entities, safeguard data during communication, and prevent malicious activities. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (FGL) with Lightweight Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) model, named DFGL-LZTA, to provide context-aware security with dynamic defense policy update, while maintaining computational and communication efficiency in resource-constrained environments, for highly distributed and heterogeneous systems in next-generation networking. Specifically, with a re-designed lightweight ZTA, which leverages adaptive privacy preservation and reputation-based aggregation together to tackle multi-level security threats (e.g., data-level, model-level, and identity-level attacks), a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent is introduced to enable the real-time and adaptive security policy update and optimization based on contextual features. A hierarchical Graph Attention Network (GAT) mechanism is then improved and applied to facilitate the dynamic subgraph learning in local training with a layer-wise architecture, while a so-called sparse global aggregation scheme is developed to balance the communication efficiency and model robustness in a P2P manner. Experiments and evaluations conducted based on two open-source datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed model in terms of training performance, computational and communication efficiency, and model accuracy, compared with other four state-of-the-art methods for next-generation networking security in modern distributed learning systems.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) model marketplaces require qualified workers to collaboratively train customized models. However, recruiting optimal workers on a limited budget in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data settings remains a fundamental issue. Moreover, inadequate quality verification exposes the marketplace to spoofing and poisoning attacks, while verifying data and model quality without accessing local storage remains a significant dilemma. To bridge the research gap, this paper proposes a knowledge-aware model customization scheme in FL model marketplaces, to facilitate zero-trust worker recruitment and verification while ensuring privacy preservation. Specifically, (i) we design a knowledge-aware quality evaluation mechanism by leveraging the knowledge of workers, i.e., soft-label predictions of their local models on a privacy-free reference dataset (provided by the customer), to assess their data quality in a privacy-preserving manner. (ii) We formulate the optimal worker recruitment problem under budget constraints as an NP-hard integer programming problem and design a dynamic programming-based optimal worker recruitment algorithm with budget feasibility and computational efficiency. (iii) We devise a two-stage zero-trust quality verification mechanism by utilizing zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to exclude distrustful workers, thereby preventing spoofing and poisoning attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances model customization performance by up to 34.3% on label-skewed non-IID data and 36.2% on feature-skewed non-IID data compared with existing representatives.}

	abstract = {With the rapid expansion of next-generation networking, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become central components of federated learning (FL) networks. FL offers a paradigm for distributed training machine learning models while preserving user data privacy. However, existing network security measures often struggle to identify legitimate contributors from opportunistic free riders within these networks. The Free Rider (FR) problem arises when participants seek to benefit from the FL processes without contributing. In particular, free riders are known to exist within or outside of the network, whereas outside free riders can hardly be identified. The Zero Trust model proposes an environment where no entity, including the network itself, is inherently trusted, providing a foundation to counter external threats seeking to exploit the network. This study proposes a novel framework strengthened by the Zero Trust model to identify external free riders in FL networks. Leveraging a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM)-based technique for internal free rider detection, our framework demonstrates superior performance in identifying free riders across various FR scenarios compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. Through our proposed framework and the principles of Zero Trust, we establish a robust security guarantee for FL networks, ensuring the integrity of the learning process.}

Nonetheless, the inherent analog transmission mechanism in AirComp-based FL (AirFL) intensifies challenges posed by potential Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL paradigm for over-the-air transmissions, referred to as federated learning with secure adaptive clustering (FedSAC). FedSAC aims to protect a portion of the devices from attacks through zero trust architecture (ZTA) based Byzantine identification and adaptive device clustering. By conducting a one-step convergence analysis, we theoretically characterize the convergence behavior with different device clustering mechanisms and uneven aggregation weighting factors for each device. Building upon our analytical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for the clustering and weighting factors in each communication round. To facilitate the targeted optimization, we propose a dynamic Byzantine identification method using historical reputation based on ZTA. Furthermore, we introduce a sequential clustering method, transforming the joint optimization into a weighting optimization problem without sacrificing the optimality. To optimize the weighting, we capitalize on the penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP) to obtain a stationary solution. Numerical results substantiate the superiority of the proposed FedSAC over existing methods in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate.}

This paper delves into the capabilities of sixth-generation (6G) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in elevating the performance of FL within vehicular networks, with a focus on integrating Zero-Trust security principles. By employing real-world vehicular trajectory data from the HighD dataset within an NS-3 simulated network environment, our study rigorously evaluates the combined impact of 6G URLLC and Zero-Trust mechanisms on FL. The findings highlight not only substantial improvements in latency, achieving reductions of up to 81%-83% compared to existing FL models, but also enhancements in throughput, reliability, and model accuracy, alongside a significant increase in security compliance rate. These improvements are pivotal for FL models, promising to optimize the data exchange process, enhance overall learning efficiency, and ensure robust security against evolving cyber threats. Our research indicates that the synergistic integration of 6G URLLC with FL, fortified by Zero-Trust security, could be instrumental in the advancement of intelligent transportation systems, ensuring enhanced vehicular safety, operational efficacy, and data security.}

	abstract = {Zero-trust has emerged as a promising security paradigm for next-generation networks (NGN). However, conventional cryptographic schemes struggle with continuous and dynamic authentication due to their coarse granularity and cumbersome processes. Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI), as a prospective solution, enables physical-layer user-transparent identity authentication. Whereas, facing the dynamic topology and device mobility of NGN, such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Drone networks, etc., there exists a current deficiency in addressing the significant performance degradation across different receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel RFFI scheme for zero-trust continuous authentication in dynamic NGN environments, enabling unified high-performance cross-receiver identification. A two-stage unsupervised domain adaptation model is designed to extract receiver-independent transmitter-specific features. The receiver-side impact on RFFI, modeled as domain shift, is addressed through adversarial training for global alignment and local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD)-based subdomain adaptation for eliminating subdomain confusion. Moreover, we further optimize RFFI through data augmentation to enhance robustness, multi-sample fusion inference to handle dynamic uncertainties, and an adaptive few-sample selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning.

Our pioneering decentralized Zero Trust Architecture (dZTA), proposed in this paper, redefines protection for IoT and remote collaboration, merging Zero Trust’s ironclad access controls with blockchain’s transparency and federated learning’s privacy-first analytics. Unlike traditional models, dZTA enforces security at every layer: a distributed policy engine eliminates single points of failure, cross-network analytics optimize WiFi-8, satellite, and 6G performance under real-world stressors, and anti-leakage protocols safeguard IoT ecosystems.

Achieving secure and reliable XR experiences while meeting high-resolution and low-latency requirements is challenging for wireless networks. A novel security-aware cross-layer communication management framework is proposed, employing zero-trust spatiotemporal physical layer level manipulations for moving-target defense. Driven by deep reinforcement learning and real-time monitoring, the proposed framework adaptively reprograms the network configuration to maximize the user’s quality of experience (QoE), reduce the overall latency, and minimize the attacker’s intercept probability. The framework was evaluated in a simulated scenario featuring an indirect multi-hop communication setup. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently secures XR user communications while maintaining QoE, outperforming conventional Q-learning algorithms.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized learning while preserving data privacy. However, ensuring security and optimizing resource utilization in FL remains challenging, particularly in untrusted environments. To address this, we propose SecureFedPROM, a novel zero-trust FL framework that integrates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for secure client authorization and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) for dynamic, multi-criteria client selection. Unlike traditional FL client selection methods that prioritize security or efficiency, SecureFedPROM optimizes trustworthiness, computational efficiency, and performance, ensuring robust participation in each training round. We evaluate SecureFedPROM across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art client selection protocols. Our results show that SecureFedPROM achieves a 7.19% improvement in model accuracy, accelerates convergence, and reduces the number of training rounds. Additionally, it minimizes wall-clock time and computational overhead, making it highly scalable for edge AI environments. These findings highlight the importance of integrating zero-trust security principles with multi-criteria decision-making to enhance security and efficiency in FL.}

It also avoids transferring large training datasets with high-resolution localization data. The FL algorithm is the subject of poisoning attacks that can be random or coordinated. In this paper, we first evaluate the impact of such attacks on the FL-based SS performance. Next, we propose a zero-trust method based on continuous monitoring and classification of the sensors’ models to detect attacked models. These models are then eliminated from the global model construction in FL. Our method is semi-blind, i.e., it does not require an apriori knowledge of who are the genuine actors participating in FL. Simulation results of the system under various attacks (random or coordinated, moderate or very aggressive, deliberately increasing or decreasing the spectrum occupancy) show that our method decreases the SS probability of false alarms by 89 % and increases the SS probability of detection by 16 % in case of the most severe targeted attacks in the most critical SNR ranges.}

	abstract = {In edge computing, the Zero-Trust Security Model (ZTSM), as a key enabling technology for next-generation networks, plays a crucial role in providing authentication for addressing data sharing concerns, such as frequent data breaches, data misuse, and cyberattacks. However, due to the complexity and diversity of edge environments, ZTSM struggles to meet the security requirements of data sharing frameworks solely through enhanced authentication. Consequently, such frameworks with ZTSM still face challenges in ensuring data integrity, evaluating various node behaviors, and coping with the increasing complexity of node attributes. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-enabled secure, fair and scalable data sharing framework in a zero-trust edge-end environment in this paper. Specifically, we first propose a Merkle forest-based data storage model for the classified storage of loosely coupled data, consequently enhancing the scalability of the model. Then, we design a node behavior-based reputation assessment mechanism to ensure fairness during data sharing. Moreover, a data sharing protocol supervised by smart contract is proposed, working with the aforementioned storage and assessment schemes, to ensure the security of data sharing. Finally, comprehensive security analysis validates the security, fairness and scalability of the proposed framework. Extensive experimental results show that, as transaction volume grows, the time cost of data traversal in the storage model becomes progressively more efficient. Additionally, when the size of the smart contract is increased tenfold, the maximum time cost of the data sharing protocol rises by only 4.98 times.}

	abstract = {Permissioned blockchain is a promising methodology to build zero-trust storage foundation with trusted data storage and sharing for the zero-trust network. However, the inherent full-backup feature of the permissioned blockchain poses potential data privacy risks and substantial storage costs, hindering its usage as a storage medium. These issues necessitate the usage of secure data deduplication technology to mitigate them. Unfortunately, current secure data deduplication schemes are predominantly designed with centralized cloud servers in mind and are not suitable for distributed blockchain systems. The reason is that the full backup feature of the permissioned blockchain renders a wide attack surface to offline brute-force and frequency analysis attacks. In response, we propose DedupChain, a secure blockchain-enabled storage system with deduplication for zero-trust networks. DedupChain employs a trusted execution environment (i.e., Inter SGX enclave) in conjunction with Oblivious RAM (ORAM) to offer a novel security guarantee named oblivious data deduplication, which empowers DedupChain with the ability to defend offline brute-force and frequency analysis attacks. DedupChain also proposes several novel techniques to address the security and efficiency issues raised by the SGX enclave. We implemented a system prototype of DedupChain and evaluated its performance metrics. Our experimental results show that DedupChain exhibits satisfactory operational delays, throughput, and storage overhead. Security analysis shows that DedupChain is robust enough to withstand several types of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply secure data deduplication techniques to address data privacy and storage cost issues raised by permissioned blockchain when used as a zero-trust storage medium.}

	abstract = {In next-generation networks, the increasing diversity of devices and connections, explosive data growth, and complex network threats render traditional security measures inadequate. This calls for robust, adaptive security frameworks. Zero-trust security offers robust protection through continuous verification and strict access control, while federated learning enhances data privacy and resource efficiency. Integrating these two approaches creates a resilient, adaptive, and secure network environment, meeting the intricate demands of future communication systems. In this paper, we propose FedKCSS—a Federated Learning-based zero-trust model combining Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Client Selection Strategy (CSS). FedKCSS comprises three components: Optimized Client Selection Strategy (OptCSS), Auxiliary Generator Training (AGT), and Data-free Federated Distillation (DfFD). In OptCSS, we design a dynamic trust evaluation method that continuously evaluates and adjusts client selection to enhance defense against untrusted clients. AGT involves designing a generator by using local model logits for data synthesis. DfFD is a data-free KD method that facilitates global-local model knowledge transfer, and lowering client information leakage risk without local data reliance. Experiments show that FedKCSS effectively minimizes malicious client participation in global training through dynamic trust evaluation, and improves the convergence rate by   \\mathbf {8.85\\%} \\mathbf {8.85\\%}   and the accuracy by   \\mathbf {7.09\\%} \\mathbf {7.09\\%}   compared with existing methods.}

To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel intrusion detection strategy based on ZTA, emphasizing the protection of alarm data privacy. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive sparse connective evolutionary neural architecture search (ASCE-NAS) framework, which enables the automatic evolution of intrusion detection model structures to enhance adaptability and performance in dynamic environments.

In a federated environment composed of multiple domains, ensuring zero trust guarantees for accessing shared resources is a challenge, as information on requesters is generated by their originating domain, yet requires explicit verification from the domain owning the resource. This paper proposes a method for federating zero trust architectures, ensuring the preservation of zero trust guarantees when accessing federated resources. The proposed approach relies on remote attestation, enabling continuous authentication and monitoring of requesters, without requiring intrusive software installations on every device within the federation. Moreover, this paper proposes a proof-of-concept architecture that combines several open-source products, to build an architecture with advanced zero trust maturity level. The feasibility of the proposed federation method is demonstrated through this proof-of-concept, providing detailed information on the federation procedure and its implementation.}

While promising, FL faces challenges in optimizing model accuracy and communication efficiency. To address these, we propose an algorithm that combines feature selection with synthetic data generation, specifically targeting medical datasets.

It also employs a zero-trust model, ensuring that data remain on local devices and only learned weights are shared with the central server, enhancing security. The algorithm improves accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving communication efficiency gains of 4 to 14 through backward elimination and threshold variation techniques.

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of blockchain has established it as a critical enabler for decentralized zero-trust services and networks. Without relying on traditional trust mechanisms such as pre-established mutual trust or central authentication, blockchain facilitates trust-free services via smart contract. Smart contracts offer verifiable software trust for various blockchain-enabled services (BESs) while protecting participants’ interests. However, the impact of blockchain on BES remains underexplored and unclear. In this work, we consider a general BES framework suitable for diverse decentralized zero-trust services and assess the role of blockchain in BES. We first build an   M/G/1 M/G/1  -type queuing model for BES and establish the stability conditions using matrix analytic methods. Based on the stability conditions, we identify the blockchain scalability and server capability as two critical bottlenecks of BES. We further use a tandem queuing model to describe the BES latency of the assembling and service phases. We analytically characterize the properties such as the convexity of service-phase latency with respect to traffic intensity, and highlight the BES pooling effects from traffic offloading and resource sharing. At last, we verify our conclusions through simulations and explore potential pathways for more efficient BES frameworks.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of encryption protocols, machine learning (ML)-based traffic analysis technologies have attracted widespread attention. To adapt to modern high-speed bandwidth, recent research is dedicated to advancing zero-trust intrusion detection by offloading feature extraction and model inference into the network dataplane. Especially, with the rise of programmable switches, achieving line-speed ML inference becomes promising. However, existing research only considers a single switch node as a relay to conduct evaluation. This is far from real-world deployments involving multiple switches (given that zero-trust security assumes that threats can originate from anywhere, including within the network), particularly the multipath routing phenomenon that exists in practice. In this paper, we reveal practical challenges in the context of enabling line-speed model inference in the network dataplane. Furthermore, we propose FCPlane, the forwarding and computing integrated dataplane for zero-trust intrusion detection that aims to enable efficient load balancing while providing reliable traffic analysis results, even against multipath routing. The core idea is to reconcile forwarding and computation to the flowlet level, for which a tailor-made Markov chain model is designed. Based on two public traffic datasets, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art in-network traffic analysis models deployed in four types of topologies (three with multipath routing and one without) to explore performance impact and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.}

To address these issues, blockchain has been considered in the Zero Trust (ZT) scenario, with the group consensus mechanism through the smart contract. Moreover, we propose a Constrained Correction Voting Mechanism (CCVM) to give punishing correction to the aggregation weight of malicious voting satellites. Furthermore, a Cold Start Reputation Aggregation (CSRA) scheme is adopted to first severely degrade and then gradually recover the weight of Federated Learning (FL) sub-models trained by malicious satellites. Thus, the Blockchain-enabled Cold Start Aggregation FRL (BCSA-FRL) scheme is proposed to make effective and secure offloading decisions in the ZT LEO satellite Networks. The numerical results illustrate the advantages of our proposal.}

	abstract = {Next-Generation Crowdsensing Networks (NGCNs) have become increasingly critical for smart cities, where data privacy and quality are pivotal concerns. Traditional trust mechanisms in crowdsensing mainly rely on static trust models, which are insufficient for dynamic security requirements. Zero-Trust security represents a promising opportunity, yet coming with notable challenges in NGCNs, including Unknown Workers Online Recruitment (UWOR), Information Elicitation Without Verification (IEWV), Privacy Preserving Data Evaluation (PPDE), and Dynamic Trust Abrupt Shift (DTAS). To address these challenges, we propose a Credibility-aware and Privacy-preserving Data collection scheme with Zero-trust (CPDZ) for secure and quality data collection in NGCNs. First, our CPDZ scheme encompasses a quality worker recruitment strategy with combinatorial multi-armed bandit models, utilizing Thompson Sampling for the secure and efficient resolution of the UWOR. Second, an active dispatching scheme for uncrewed aerial vehicles is crafted to collect data as a gold standard to assist in overcoming the IEWV challenge. Third, as for the PPDE challenge, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving scheme for dependable truth discovery and secure trust verification. Fourth, the DTAS challenge is managed by a dual verification scheme that integrates short-term and long-term trust assessments, ensuring stability and adaptability of the zero-trust security in our CPDZ scheme. Experiments confirm the superiority of our CPDZ scheme, showing a 12.5% increase in recruitment revenue and a 57.8% reduction in relative error compared to existing approaches}

	abstract = {Security and privacy on the Internet rely on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is based on unlimited trust in a set of predefined certification authorities included in the users’ root stores. However, the architecture of the PKI is no longer appropriate for the current threat landscape and security principles. Specifically, the implicit and permanent trust given to certification authorities collides with the rising zero trust approach, a cyber-security model that mandates that trust must never be granted implicitly or permanently to any entity. This work offers a zero trust perspective on the PKI and root store composition. Using navigation datasets collected from users’ browsers and passive monitors, we analyze their actual needs and identify the portion of root stores that are useful for their activity. We propose several zero trust policies to manage root stores that shrink the large perimeter of trust allowed by commercial root stores. Our experiments show that less than half of the root certificates included in the Mozilla root store are indeed used for navigation, while only 14 cover 99% of the traffic of our users. Moreover, implementing such policies requires little effort for a company, providing a practical way for managing root stores with up-to-date security principles.}

	abstract = {Web applications have become integral to daily life due to the migration of applications and data to cloud-based platforms, increasing their vulnerability to attacks. This paper addresses the need for robust intrusion detection systems by proposing a system grounded in Zero Trust architecture, which mandates continuous monitoring and multi-layered defenses. The Zero Trust principles ensure ongoing threat assessment and comprehensive protection against various attack vectors. Building on these foundational Zero Trust principles, our study introduces a system designed to not only distinguish normal HTTP requests from well-known attack patterns but also detect emerging types of anomalous attacks. Our system consists of two models that integrate Natural Language Processing approaches, Deep Learning techniques, and Transfer Learning strategies. The first model is employed to detect new anomalous HTTP requests that differ from normal requests. HTTP requests identified as anomalous are transmitted to the second model in charge of classifying specific categories of both well-known and novel attacks. Experiments show that our end-to-end system achieves the average F1-score of 89% on the combination of the CAPEC dataset and the zero-shot CSIC dataset. The proposed system proves also to be able to identify anomalous requests with a minimal latency of 4.8 milliseconds in production settings.}

	abstract = {Space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), which integrates satellite systems, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offers ubiquitous coverage for a multitude of applications. Nevertheless, the highly dynamic and open nature of SAGIN increases the network’s vulnerability. Hence, zero-trust security, operating on the principle of “never trust, always verify”, holds the significant potential of securing SAGIN. However, implementing zero-trust SAGIN in practice presents three primary challenges: 1) understanding massive unstructured threat information across diverse domains, 2) performing adaptive security assessments, and 3) making in-depth security decisions. This motivates us to propose SAG-Attack and LLM-SA to enhance zero-trust SAGIN. SAG-Attack serves as a simulator that aims to mimic various attacks in SAGIN. Our LLM-SA is a novel situation awareness method that explores the multiple agents of large language model (LLM). Specifically, the output logs of SAG-Attack will be fed into LLM-SA, and LLM-SA fuses vast amounts of heterogeneous threat information from various domains, thus tackling the first challenge. Then, our LLM-SA relies on multiple LLM-based agents to perform adaptive security assessments, utilizing the chain-of-thought capabilities of LLMs to automatically generate in-depth defense strategies, thereby addressing the second and third challenges. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SAG-Attack and LLM-SA. Notably, our method based on open-sourced Llama3-8B even outperforms ChatGPT-4 under the same setting, despite involving significantly fewer parameters. To foster further research in this area, we will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of zero-trust SAGIN.}

	abstract = {The coexistence of heterogeneous sub-networks in 6G poses new security and trust concerns and thus calls for a perimeterless-security model. Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) provides a trust-building approach via repeated interactions rather than relying on pre-established trust or central authentication. Such a trust-building process naturally supports dynamic trusted services across various service providers (SP) without the need for perimeter-based authentications; however, it remains vulnerable to environmental and system unreliability such as wireless channel uncertainty. In this study, we investigate channel unreliability in the trust-building framework based on repeated interactions for secure wireless services. We derive specific requirements for achieving cooperation between SPs and clients via a repeated game model and illustrate the implications of channel unreliability on sustaining trusted wireless services. We consider the framework design and optimization to guarantee SP-client cooperation, given the worst channel condition and/or the least cooperation willingness. Furthermore, we explore the maximum cooperation area to enhance service resilience and reveal the trade-off relationship between transmission efficiency, security integrity, and cooperative margin. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate the system performance over fading channels and verify our results.}

How to analyze the risks involved in authentication is a challenge. This study quantifies authentication risks within the zero-trust framework and introduces a privacy domain prevention-control theory. The theory encompasses dynamic privacy risk assessment, intelligent risk classification, and automated selection of privacy protection schemes. First, a dynamic privacy risk assessment method, based on physical entity relationships, is proposed to evaluate all privacy risks. Second, a five-category risk classification method is designed to categorize privacy risks, facilitating the selection of prevention-control schemes, with its rationality mathematically validated. Additionally, an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based method is introduced to guide the optimal selection of prevention-control schemes for various scenarios. Finally, the practical application of the theory in medicine multi-modal computing scene of wireless body area networks demonstrates its effectiveness. The experimental results also show the superiority and feasibility of the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of technologies such as B5G/6G and edge computing, network scenarios are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to the emergence of slicing networks. Virtualizing applications into distinct categories and establishing corresponding network slices ensures performance to a certain extent. However, the challenges posed by the complex slicing environment demand more fine-grained routing control and higher costs to locate requested content or services, areas where current state-of-the-art methods fall short. To address these challenges, this work introduces a system framework that integrates the principles of Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). An SRv6 optimization layer is created between the control and infrastructure layers to manage slices effectively and enhance routing control. Additionally, we propose a novel policy routing method based on zero-trust and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) technology. This method transforms actions into policies that can be flexibly deployed on SRv6 nodes, segment by segment. These actions encompass both routing and security measures, allowing for dynamic and flexible deployment of policies on each segment to achieve the desired goals. This integration of segment routing and zero-trust principles simplifies implementation and enhances security. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a higher service acceptance rate, better resource utilization, and reduced average latency and packet loss rate.}

With the growing adoption of applications such as “Industry 4.0,” high security and low latency are becoming unavoidable requirements for these networks. Traditional virtual private networks (VPNs) generally experience performance, latency, and security issues, especially when supporting secure remote access for Industry 4.0 and e-health applications. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel zero-trust network-access framework for next-generation industrial networks called Secure Transmission (SecT). SecT is a User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based solution, ensuring speed and effectiveness, with role-based access control. It uses a centralized management interface that can adapt to various network environments, providing secure access to mission-critical applications and increasing operational agility. SecT aims to meet the emerging demands of modern industrial networks, offering secure access with improved performance. The results of a comparative analysis show that SecT outperforms traditional VPNs in both capability and flexibility, adapting well to new network conditions.}

	abstract = {Traditional traffic anomaly-based attack detection methods in Zero-trust Networks (ZTN) suffer from inherent security vulnerabilities, as they neglect considerations regarding their security defenses. Compromising the attack detection model itself can result in the breakdown of normal attack detection capabilities. Ensuring the security of the attack detection model during runtime presents a novel challenge. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel attack detection model, termed Security within Security: Attack Detection Model with Defenses Against Attacks Capability for Zero-Trust Networks (SWS), aimed at enhancing the security of ZTN. SWS focuses on achieving attack detection in non-secure detection environments, to maintain its detection capability even when under attack. By employing a soft thresholding method, SWS adapts to the dynamic changes in network traffic, thus reducing the interference of attack signals. The incorporation of an attention mechanism enables SWS to concentrate on analyzing the most indicative traffic features of attack behavior. Additionally, we integrate Residual Networks (ResNet) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to enhance the robustness of identifying complex network attack behaviors. The effectiveness of the SWS is validated through ablation studies, model comparisons, experiments conducted over different training epochs, and experiments conducted on various components of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing attack detection models, SWS achieves improvements in detection accuracy and recall rate by 13.4% and 10.6%, respectively, while reducing the False Positive Rate (FPR) by 16.9%.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the challenge of acquiring channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in time-division duplex (TDD) mode. Although channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) is readily obtainable and CSIT is typically assumed to be its transpose, imperfections in the radio frequency (RF) chains disrupt this reciprocity. Focusing on this issue, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing RF chain imperfections and their impact on system performance in a simplified scenario, underscoring the criticality of channel calibration. To address this challenge, a distributed source coding (DSC)-based calibration framework is proposed, leveraging the multiplexing of the sensing task to eliminate any additional communication overhead. This framework comprises a distributed compression scheme at each secondary access point (AP) and a joint aggregation scheme at the central process unit (CPU). To validate the proposed DSC-based calibration framework, we analytically derive the performance gap relative to the fully collaborated approach. Building on this, a novel data-driven DSC-based deep learning method is proposed to address channel calibration without requiring clean labels. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement in calibration performance achieved by our proposed method compared to existing calibration methods, approaching the performance of the fully collaborated method.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel learning-based Wyner-Ziv coding framework is considered under a distributed image transmission scenario, where the correlated source is only available at the receiver. Unlike other learnable frameworks, our approach demonstrates robustness to non-stationary source correlation, where the overlapping information between image pairs varies. Specifically, we first model the affine relationship between correlated images and leverage this model for learnable mask generation and rate-adaptive joint source-channel coding. Moreover, we also provide a warping-prediction network to remove the distortion from channel interference and affine transform. Intuitively, the observed performance improvement is largely due to focusing on the simple geometric relationship, rather than the complex joint distribution between the sources. Numerical results show that our framework achieves a 1.5 dB gain in PSNR and a 0.2 improvement in MS-SSIM, along with a significant superiority in perceptual metric, compared to state-of-the-art methods when applied to real-world samples with non-stationary correlations.}

	abstract = {A composite source, consisting of multiple subsources and a memoryless switch, outputs one symbol at a time from the subsource selected by the switch. If some data should be encoded more accurately than other data from an information source, the composite source model is suitable because in this model different distortion constraints can be put on the subsources. In this context, we propose subsource-dependent fidelity criteria for composite sources and use them to formulate a rate-distortion problem. We solve the problem and obtain a single-letter expression for the rate-distortion function. Further rate-distortion analysis characterizes the performance of classify-then-compress (CTC) coding, which is frequently used in practice when subsource-dependent fidelity criteria are considered. Our analysis shows that CTC coding generally has performance loss relative to optimal coding, even if the classification is perfect. We also identify the cause of the performance loss, that is, class labels have to be reproduced in CTC coding. Last but not least, we show that the performance loss is negligible for asymptotically small distortion if CTC coding is appropriately designed and some mild conditions are satisfied.}

	abstract = {The relay channel, consisting of a source-destination pair along with a relay, is a fundamental component of cooperative communications. While the capacity of a general relay channel remains unknown, various relaying strategies, including compress-and-forward (CF), have been proposed. In CF, the relay forwards a quantized version of its received signal to the destination. Given the correlated signals at the relay and destination, distributed compression techniques, such as Wyner-Ziv coding, can be harnessed to utilize the relay-to-destination link more efficiently. Leveraging recent advances in neural network-based distributed compression, we revisit the relay channel problem and integrate a learned task-aware Wyner-Ziv compressor into a primitive relay channel with a finite-capacity out-of-band relay-to-destination link. The resulting neural CF scheme demonstrates that our compressor recovers binning of the quantized indices at the relay, mimicking the optimal asymptotic CF strategy, although no structure exploiting the knowledge of source statistics was imposed into the design. The proposed neural CF, employing finite order modulation, operates closely to the rate achievable in a primitive relay channel with a Gaussian codebook. We showcase the advantages of exploiting the correlated destination signal for relay compression through various neural CF architectures that involve end-to-end training of the compressor and the demodulator components. Our learned task-oriented compressors provide the first proof-of-concept work toward interpretable and practical neural CF relaying schemes.}

We then propose a neural network-based approach that learns a non-linear constellation mapping with the objective of maximizing the sumrate.

	abstract = {In modern wireless systems, the feedback of DownLink (DL) Channel State Information (CSI) from User Equipment (UE) to Base Stations (BS) may require substantial computational and feedback bandwidth overheads. A promising approach to improve feedback efficiency is to leverage side information which is correlated to DL CSI. Despite potential of doing so, critical aspects remain underexplored in current research, particularly the quantification of the benefits and the inherent limitations of utilizing side information. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel algorithm to compute the rate-distortion function for general compression scenarios incorporating side information. We apply this algorithm to the DL CSI feedback problem having UL CSI as the side information and generate rate-distortion functions. Using the estimated rate-distortion functions, we measure the gain of side information over diverse feedback rates and UE mobility profiles. The results reveal that the benefits of leveraging side information are particularly significant for UEs characterized by high mobility and constrained to operate at low feedback overheads.}

	abstract = {Satellite communications can provide massive connections and seamless coverage, but they also face several challenges, such as rain attenuation, long propagation delays, and co-channel interference. To improve transmission efficiency and address severe scenarios, semantic communication has become a popular choice, particularly when equipped with foundation models (FMs). In this study, we introduce an FM-based semantic satellite communication framework, termed FMSAT. This framework leverages FM-based segmentation and reconstruction to significantly reduce bandwidth requirements and accurately recover semantic features under high noise and interference. Considering the high speed of satellites, an adaptive encoder-decoder is proposed to protect important features and avoid frequent retransmissions. Meanwhile, a well-received image can provide a reference for repairing damaged images under sudden attenuation. Since acknowledgment feedback is subject to long propagation delays when retransmission is unavoidable, a novel error detection method is proposed to roughly detect semantic errors at the regenerative satellite. With the proposed detectors at both the satellite and the gateway, the quality of the received images can be ensured. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce bandwidth requirements, adapt to complex satellite scenarios, and protect semantic information with an acceptable transmission delay.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of multimedia data volume, there is an increasing need for efficient video transmission in applications such as virtual reality and future video streaming services. Semantic communication is emerging as a vital technique for ensuring efficient and reliable transmission in low-bandwidth, high-noise settings. However, most current approaches focus on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) that depends on end-to-end training. These methods often lack an interpretable semantic representation and struggle with adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce the use of object-attribute-relation (OAR) as a semantic framework for videos to facilitate low bit-rate coding and enhance the JSCC process for more effective video transmission. We utilize OAR sequences for both low bit-rate representation and generative video reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate OAR into the image JSCC model to prioritize communication resources for areas more critical to downstream tasks. Our experiments on traffic surveillance video datasets assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of video transmission performance. The empirical findings demonstrate that our OAR-based video coding method not only outperforms H.265 coding at lower bit-rates but also synergizes with JSCC to deliver robust and efficient video transmission.}

	abstract = {Although semantic communication (SC) has shown its potential in efficiently transmitting multimodal data such as texts, speeches and images, SC for videos has focused primarily on pixel-level reconstruction. However, these SC systems may be suboptimal for downstream intelligent tasks. Moreover, SC systems without pixel-level video reconstruction present advantages by achieving higher bandwidth efficiency and real-time performance of various intelligent tasks. The difficulty in such system design lies in the extraction of task-related compact semantic representations and their accurate delivery over noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SC system, named VideoQA-SC for video question answering (VideoQA) tasks. Our goal is to accomplish VideoQA tasks directly based on video semantics over noisy or fading wireless channels, bypassing the need for video reconstruction at the receiver. To this end, we develop a spatiotemporal semantic encoder for effective video semantic extraction, and a learning-based bandwidth-adaptive deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) scheme for efficient and robust video semantic transmission. Experiments demonstrate that VideoQA-SC outperforms traditional and advanced DJSCC-based SC systems that rely on video reconstruction at the receiver under a wide range of channel conditions and bandwidth constraints. In particular, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, VideoQA-SC can improve the answer accuracy by 5.17% while saving almost 99.5% of the bandwidth at the same time, compared with the advanced DJSCC-based SC system. Our results show the great potential of SC system design for video applications.}

In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemCom framework and a corresponding system called HDA-DeepSC, which leverages a hybrid digital-analog approach for multimedia transmission. This is achieved through the introduction of analog-digital allocation and fusion modules. To strike a balance between data rate and distortion, we design new loss functions that take into account long-distance dependencies in the semantic distortion constraint, essential information recovery in the channel distortion constraint, and optimal bit stream generation in the rate constraint. Additionally, we propose denoising diffusion-based signal detection techniques, which involve carefully designed variance schedules and sampling algorithms to refine transmitted signals. Through extensive numerical experiments, we will demonstrate that HDA-DeepSC exhibits robustness to channel variations and is capable of supporting various communication scenarios.

In this work, a generative SemCom framework utilizing pre-trained foundation models is proposed, where both uncoded forward-with-error and coded discard-with-error schemes are developed for the semantic decoder. Using the rate-distortion-perception theory, the relationship between regenerated signal quality and transmission reliability is characterized, which is proven to be non-decreasing. Based on this, semantic values are defined to quantify the semantic similarity between multimodal semantic features and the original source. We also investigate semantic-aware power allocation problems that minimize power consumption for ultra-low rate and high fidelity SemComs. Two semantic-aware power allocation methods are proposed by leveraging the non-decreasing property of the perception-error relationship. Based on the Kodak dataset, perception-error functions and semantic values are obtained for image tasks. Simulation results show that the proposed semantic-aware method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in the channel-coded case (up to 90% power saving).}

Our framework consists of two core components: the Multidomain Adaptive Semantic Coding Network (MASCN), inherently designed to adapt semantic encoding and decoding across multiple domains, and the multidomain data adaptation network (MDAN), which transforms actual observable data into the data on which the system was initially trained, thus obviating the need for retraining the existing pre-trained semantic coding network. We validate our approach through experiments on digit datasets and CelebA, observing significant outperformance over existing techniques. In addition, we analyze the strategic benefits and drawbacks of both MASC and MDAN, assessing their applicability under various scenarios.

In particular, error correction code transformer (ECCT), which utilizes the transformer architecture, has achieved state-of-the-art performance among neural network-based decoders. We present three technical contributions to significantly enhance the performance of ECCT. First, we propose a novel transformer architecture of ECCT, termed the multiple-masks ECCT (MM ECCT). We employ multiple masked self-attention blocks with different mask matrices in a parallel manner to learn diverse relationships among the codeword bits. Second, we discover that constructing mask matrices based on systematic parity check matrices (PCMs) can make the attention maps sparse, which not only enhances the decoding performance but also reduces computational complexity. Finally, we propose using complementary mask matrices derived from cyclic permutations of the systematic PCM. These complementary mask matrices are specifically designed to enhance the decoding of cyclic codes. Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed MM ECCT architecture with carefully designed mask matrices outperforms the original ECCT by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art decoding performance among neural decoders.

Addressing this need, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DeepJSCC framework, h-DJSCC, tailored for effective image transmission from edge devices through a network architecture that includes initial wireless transmission followed by multiple wired hops. Our approach harnesses the strengths of DeepJSCC for the initial, variable-quality wireless link to avoid the cliff effect inherent in purely digital schemes. For the subsequent wired hops, which feature more stable and high-capacity connections, we implement digital compression and forwarding techniques to prevent noise accumulation. This dual-mode strategy is adaptable even in scenarios with limited knowledge of the image distribution, enhancing the framework’s robustness and utility. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our hybrid solution outperforms traditional fully digital approaches by effectively managing transitions between different network segments and optimizing for variable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We also introduce a fully adaptive h-DJSCC architecture with both SNR-adaptive (SA) and rate-adaptive (RA) modules capable of adjusting to different network conditions and achieving diverse rate-distortion objectives, thereby reducing the memory requirements on network nodes.}

	abstract = {From the perspective of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), there has been significant research on utilizing semantic communication, which inherently possesses analog characteristics, within digital device environments. However, a single-model approach that operates modulation-agnostically across various digital modulation orders has not yet been established. This article presents the first attempt at such an approach by proposing a universal joint source-channel coding (uJSCC) system that utilizes a single-model encoder-decoder pair and trained vector quantization (VQ) codebooks. To support various modulation orders within a single model, the operation of every neural network (NN)-based module in the uJSCC system requires the selection of modulation orders according to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boundaries. To address the challenge of unequal output statistics from shared parameters across NN layers, we integrate multiple batch normalization (BN) layers, selected based on modulation order, after each NN layer. This integration occurs with minimal impact on the overall model size. Through a comprehensive series of experiments, we validate that the modulation-agnostic semantic communication framework demonstrates superiority over existing digital semantic communication approaches in terms of model complexity, communication efficiency, and task effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.}

	abstract = {Pragmatic or goal-oriented communication can optimize communication decisions beyond the reliable transmission of data, instead aiming at directly affecting application performance with the minimum channel utilization. In this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework for the remote control of finite-state Markov processes, using pragmatic communication over a costly zero-delay communication channel. To that end, we model a cyber-physical system composed of an encoder, which observes and transmits the states of a process in real-time, and a decoder, which receives that information and controls the behavior of the process. The encoder and the decoder should cooperatively optimize the trade-off between the control performance (i.e., reward) and the communication cost (i.e., channel use). This scenario underscores a pragmatic (i.e., goal-oriented) communication problem, where the purpose is to convey only the data that is most valuable for the underlying task, taking into account the state of the decoder (hence, the pragmatic aspect). We investigate two different decision-making architectures: in pull-based remote control, the decoder is the only decision-maker, while in push-based remote control, the encoder and the decoder constitute two independent decision-makers, leading to a multi-agent scenario. We propose three algorithms to optimize our system (i.e., design the encoder and the decoder policies), discuss the optimality guarantees ofs the algorithms, and shed light on their computational complexity and fundamental limits.}

	abstract = {The existing task-agnostic and resource-constrained satellite communication fails to meet diverse task demands in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network. In this paper, to enable the ubiquitous intelligent services with massive traffic for global users through satellite-Integrated Internet, we first propose a novel semantic metric named utility loss of information (UoI), which can capture the task-oriented aspects by quantifying both value loss of semantic mismatch, and energy loss of unnecessary transmissions. Then, we design a UoI minimization data generation and transmission (UMGT) scheme for task-adaptive communications in satellite-Integrated Internet with energy constraint and reliability requirement. For the time-varying satellite-terrestrial link with high bit error rate (BER) and delayed feedback, we derive the closed-form expressions of BER, and apply the long erasure coding (LEC) to combat the deep fading. Subsequently, we transform the optimization problem to minimize the upper bound of an unconstrained Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty (DPP). Further, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to intelligently choose when to generate data, how to adjust the number of LEC packets and whether to retransmit, thereby minimizing the average UoI. Simulation results validate that our UMGT scheme can achieve the lowest UoI than several state-of-the-art schemes, and demonstrate its adaptability to various task demands.}

	abstract = {Free-view video (FVV) allows users to explore immersive video content from multiple views. However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms.

	abstract = {By extracting task-relevant information while maximally compressing the input, the information bottleneck (IB) principle has provided a guideline for learning effective and robust representations of the target inference. However, extending the idea to the multi-task learning scenario with joint consideration of generative tasks and traditional reconstruction tasks remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by reconsidering the lossy compression problem with diverse constraints on data reconstruction, perceptual quality, and classification accuracy. Firstly, we study two ternary relationships, namely, the rate-distortion-classification (RDC) and rate-perception-classification (RPC). For both RDC and RPC functions, we derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal rate for binary and Gaussian sources. These new results complement the IB principle and provide insights into effectively extracting task-oriented information to fulfill diverse objectives. Secondly, unlike prior research demonstrating a tradeoff between classification and perception in signal restoration problems, we prove that such a tradeoff does not exist in the RPC function and reveal that the source noise plays a decisive role in the classification-perception tradeoff. Finally, we implement a deep-learning-based image compression framework, incorporating multiple tasks related to distortion, perception, and classification. The experimental results coincide with the theoretical analysis and verify the effectiveness of our generalized IB in balancing various task objectives.}

	abstract = {End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver’s limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a pilot-free posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.}

	abstract = {Task-oriented communication aims to extract and transmit task-relevant information to significantly reduce the communication overhead and transmission latency. However, the unpredictable distribution shifts between training and test data, including domain shift and semantic shift, can dramatically undermine the system performance. In order to tackle these challenges, it is crucial to ensure that the encoded features can generalize to domain-shifted data and detect semantic-shifted data, while remaining compact for transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the information bottleneck (IB) principle and invariant risk minimization (IRM) framework. The proposed method aims to extract compact and informative features that possess high capability for effective domain-shift generalization and accurate semantic-shift detection without any knowledge of the test data during training. Specifically, we propose an invariant feature encoding approach based on the IB principle and IRM framework for domain-shift generalization, which aims to find the causal relationship between the input data and task result by minimizing the complexity and domain dependence of the encoded feature. Furthermore, we enhance the task-oriented communication with the label-dependent feature encoding approach for semantic-shift detection which achieves joint gains in IB optimization and detection performance. To avoid the intractable computation of the IB-based objective, we leverage variational approximation to derive a tractable upper bound for optimization. Extensive simulation results on image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves a better rate-distortion tradeoff.}

Although several existing works have attempted to address these challenges simultaneously, they often overlook essential learning-oriented features such as dynamic gradient and communication characteristics. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed SGD algorithm. Our proposed algorithm employs a layered randomized quantizer (LRQ) to reduce communication overhead, which also ensures that quantization errors follow an exact Gaussian distribution, thus achieving client-level differential privacy. We analyze the trade-off between convergence error, communication, and privacy under non-IID data distributions. Besides, we modify the algorithm to be training-adaptive by adjusting the per-round privacy budget allocation in response to i) dynamic gradient features and ii) real-time changing communication rounds. Both closed-form solutions are derived by solving the minimization problem of convergence error subject to the privacy budget constraint. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on various datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrating its superiority in terms of communication cost, privacy protection, and model performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

The exact mechanisms behind such phenomena are not fully understood and remain a topic of active research. Inspired by the skill-text bipartite graph model proposed by Arora and Goyal for modeling semantic languages, we develop a mathematical theory to explain the emergence of learned skills, taking the learning (or training) process into account. Our approach models the learning process for skills in the skill-text bipartite graph as an iterative decoding process in Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes and Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). Using density evolution analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of learned skills when the ratio of the number of training texts to the number of skills exceeds a certain threshold. Our analysis also yields a scaling law for testing errors relative to this ratio. Upon completion of the training, the association of learned skills can also be acquired to form a skill association graph. We use site percolation analysis to derive the conditions for the existence of a giant component in the skill association graph. Our analysis can also be extended to the setting with a hierarchy of skills, where a fine-tuned model is built upon a foundation model. It is also applicable to the setting with multiple classes of skills and texts. As an important application, we propose a method for semantic compression and discuss its connections to semantic communication.}

This observation motivates distributed settings, in which intermediate computations are performed across a network of processing units, while the central node only aggregates their outputs. However, distributing inference tasks across low-precision or faulty edge devices, operating over a network of noisy communication channels, gives rise to serious reliability challenges. We study the problem of an ensemble of devices, implementing regression algorithms, that communicate through additive noisy channels in order to collaboratively perform a joint regression task. We define the problem formally, and develop methods for optimizing the aggregation coefficients for the parameters of the noise in the channels, which can potentially be correlated. Our results apply to the leading state-of-the-art ensemble regression methods: bagging and gradient boosting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.}

	abstract = {With the approach of the quantum era, public key cryptography (PKC) faces risks, which also presents challenges to blockchain technologies that utilize PKC as a core component. Sharding blockchain is a promising way to realize scalability, yet current research does not consider quantum-resistant sharding blockchains as it is non-trivial to design cross-shard communication and transaction processing method without PKC. Besides, blockchain enables reliability in data transmission and unbreakable communication while current schemes suffer from high overhead and low throughput. In this paper, we propose a quantum-resistant sharding blockchain (QRShar) and a secure data transmission scheme (QRDT) to fill the above gap. Firstly, we design a secure and efficient cross-shard communication pattern utilizing hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) and erasure code to reduce the transmission load and achieve high efficiency. Secondly, we propose the a quantum-resistant sharding blockchain utilizing optimized cross-shard transaction processing method to decrease the consensus execution frequency. Thirdly, we introduce a quantum-resistant key agreement protocol through the verifiable secret sharing on cryptographic hash function and we also offer a data transmission scheme to realize efficient QRDT. Furthermore, we conduct security analysis and performance evaluations for our schemes. The results show that the QRShar throughput can reach up to 34 KTPS and the latency stays below 2 seconds. The key agreement latency is just 43ms.}

	abstract = {Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Consequently, the information-theoretic bound of the secret key rate and the security performance of a decoy-state QKD protocol are analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles or moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.}

	abstract = {The emergence of quantum computing poses a threat to classical cryptography algorithms, necessitating a shift to quantum secure cryptography. Hybrid protocols combining at least one classical and one quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm are becoming the standard for securing communications. In this work, we present our novel solution for integrating three different cryptographic assumptions (two of them quantum-resistant) into hybrid network security protocols, ensuring that three different cryptographic assumptions must be broken before the protocol becomes vulnerable. Our solution allows for a seamless integration of classical and post-quantum (PQ) cryptography, and quantum key distribution (QKD) into existing network security protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec) without any major modifications to the protocols themselves. This crypto-agility ensures the mitigation of some of the most well known challenges of both PQ cryptography and QKD. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of such triple-hybrid network security protocols, showing non-substantial decrease in performance and almost no added packet overhead compared to state of the art protocols. In exchange, we pave the way towards next generation networks where the potential of new quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes can be leveraged in a dynamic and agile fashion, thus fostering a new era of unbreakable communication systems.}

However, existing decentralized solutions still face critical challenges including consistency and fairness that stem from storable nature of quantum key material. Thus, in this paper, we first devise a Key Management and Service (KM&S) framework for decentralized multi-hop QKD networks, which provides functional decoupling and pipeline processing to guarantee flexibility and compatibility for practical implementation. After that, to address consistency and fairness challenges during end-to-end key exchange service, we focus on two aspects including local key management and end-to-end congestion control, and respectively propose an elastic key supply rate control scheme named AUTO and a Capacity Probing-driven Backpressure Flow Control (CP-BFC) scheme. Furthermore, we construct an experiment platform equipped with realistic QKD devices based on China metropolitan QKD network topology to implement the proposed framework and schemes, and conduct extensive experiments compared to representative schemes in existing studies. The experimental results show that AUTO&CP-BFC significantly outperforms representative schemes in terms of consistency and fairness.}

	abstract = {One of the consequences in the distribution of quantum states over a long distance is that, since resulting quantum states are noisy due to the intervention of an environment, a measurement setting should be re-aligned to optimize detection events, for which additional experimental resources such as quantum tomography of a channel or resulting states is necessary. In this work, we present a protocol for protecting an optimal measurement setup without verifying a channel. A receiver does not have to revise the measurement prepared in a noiseless scenario since it would remain optimal for quantum states resulting from an unknown and noisy channel. The measurement protection protocol realizes a supermap describing transformations over quantum channels and is experimentally feasible as it only applies local unitary transformations before and after the transmission. We present experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations of the measurement protection protocol. We also apply the measurement protection to a prepare-and-measure protocol, the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol, and find that preserving an optimal measurement can suppress quantum-bit error rates, allowing the protocol to tolerate an even higher noise during transmission. The BB84 protocol with the measurement protection is experimentally demonstrated with the polarization encoding on photonic qubits.}

	abstract = {Quantum computing holds the promise of solving problems difficult for classical computers. However, we are still in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, necessary to establish effective distributed quantum communication protocols to distribute complex quantum computing tasks across different quantum computers for execution. Significant progress has been made in quantum communication technology, particularly in quantum path creation and resource scheduling. The establishment of quantum paths relies on quantum entanglement and quantum relay technologies, achieving long-distance, high-fidelity quantum state transmission through entanglement swapping between multiple relays. However, resources in quantum communication networks are limited and expensive, making efficient resource scheduling strategies crucial for improving overall network efficiency. To address these issues, we design a network protocol that includes the Historical Weighted Fidelity Routing (HWFR) algorithm and the Dynamic Multi-Priority Quantum Scheduling (DMPQS) algorithm to enhance communication reliability across quantum computers. Both algorithms aim to enhance the reliability of quantum links, optimize resource utilization, and adapt to dynamic changes in the links. The former algorithm dynamically selects the optimal path by considering factors such as link length, noise level, entanglement success rate, and quantum relay resource constraints, ensuring high-fidelity and reliable quantum communication. The latter dynamically adjusts request priorities based on the urgency of quantum service requests and fidelity requirements, optimizing resource utilization. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol performs excellently in terms of an average response time of requests and link utilization, effectively improving the utilization efficiency of network resources and the overall performance of the system.}

	abstract = {Recently, quantum federated learning (QFL) is advocated to leverage the robust computing power of quantum edge computing devices (QECDs) within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks, to enhance the efficiency of distributed learning. However, the presence of malicious and selfish behaviors among some QECDs poses significant challenges for QFL model training to achieve high accuracy and rapid convergence. To tackle this issue, we introduce a trust-enhanced incentive scheme for QFL in the UAV-assisted wireless networks. Specifically, a QECD-empowered QFL framework is first presented in the UAV-assisted wireless networks, where the QECDs independently train local models with their private data by using the quantum computing capabilities, while UAVs aggregate these trained local models to update the global model. Then, to ensure security and eliminate malicious participants, we devise a Bayesian inference-based trust assessment mechanism to select honest QECDs for local model training. Furthermore, we design a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism to incentivize QECDs to cooperatively provide high-quality training services. Afterwards, through game analysis using the backward induction method, we prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium. The optimal payment strategies of the UAVs are obtained using the deep Q-learning network (DQN) algorithm in dynamic networks, and the optimal training contribution strategy of each QECD is derived using the convex optimization method. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the accuracy and training speed of QFL in UAV-assisted wireless networks.}

	abstract = {With the development of quantum blockchain, the quantum consensus protocols have garnered increasing attention, which play a crucial role in driving the implementation of quantum blockchains. However, existing protocols, derived from the classical consensus algorithms, face practical application challenges due to current quantum technology limitations. The first challenge is the bottleneck in generating large-scale entangled quantum states. The second challenge arises from the generation of malicious quantum states. The final challenge involves privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a practical iterative QUantum consensus protocol with sharding construction, namely, Q-Union. In fact, Q-Union employs an iterative consensus algorithm where participating nodes are divided into multiple smaller shards, with the consensus process occurring within the current shard, and new shards are involved only if consensus is not achieved. Leveraging Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinge states and Aharonov states, Q-Union harnesses the advantages of quantum mechanics to achieve anonymous consensus, protecting the private information of participating nodes. Additionally, by integrating state verification, Q-Union ensures the correctness of the consensus procedure in the presence of malicious nodes generating adversarial quantum states. Finally, it is proven that Q-Union can also defend against Byzantine attacks from adversarial nodes, maintaining the same security level as traditional non-sharded consensus protocols. Specifically, it consistently outputs the correct consensus when the fraction of adversaries among participating nodes is less than   1/2 1 / 2 1/2   with synchronous communication. Both the theoretical analysis and performance illustration demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Q-Union compared to state-of-the-art protocols.}

	abstract = {In the shift toward the quantum computing era, the foundational principles of classical cybersecurity, particularly in the realm of cryptographic algorithms, are facing unprecedented challenges. This demands comprehensive reevaluation and redesign of cryptographic infrastructures to withstand quantum adversarial attacks. With the emergence of the quantum Internet, a new approach to secure communication is possible, utilizing quantum properties that have no counterpart in classical systems. As the quantum Internet facilitates the exchange of quantum information, data publication protocols become essential in anonymizing and protecting privacy-sensitive data in quantum communication networks. This paper proposes two controlled quantum anonymous communication (QAC) protocols for publishing classical and quantum information on an Internet server (IS) with the assistance of a communication service provider. The first protocol allows for the controlled publication of classical information without revealing the publisher’s identity such that an adversary, even with access to all network resources, cannot trace the publication source—i.e., achieving perfect untraceability. The second protocol enables anonymous publication of quantum information on an IS in a controlled and untraceable manner. These protocols serve as essential building blocks for advancing the quantum Internet, which has the potential to transform communication and information exchange methods. We provide a detailed anonymity analysis of these QAC protocols for data publication, ensuring that the published symbol or qudit information remains untraceable to its publisher. Moreover, the performance analysis in terms of publication error probability, fidelity, and degree of anonymity in noisy environments demonstrates the robustness of the protocols against noise and adversarial attacks.}

	abstract = {Autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) represent a future vision where industrial systems achieve full autonomy, integrating physical processes seamlessly with communication, computing and control technologies while holistically embedding intelligence. Cloud-Fog Automation is a new digitalized industrial automation reference architecture that has been recently proposed. This architecture is a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model to accelerate the convergence and synergy of communication, computing, and control towards a fully autonomous ICPS. With the deployment of new wireless technologies to enable almost-deterministic ultra-reliable low-latency communications, a joint design of optimal control and computing has become increasingly important in modern ICPS. It is also imperative that system-wide cyber-physical security are critically enforced. Despite recent advancements in the field, there are still significant research gaps and open technical challenges. Therefore, a deliberate rethink in co-designing and synergizing communications, computing, and control (which we term “3C co-design”) is required. In this paper, we position Cloud-Fog Automation with 3C co-design as the new paradigm to realize the vision of autonomous ICPS. We articulate the state-of-the-art and future directions in the field, and specifically discuss how goal-oriented communication, virtualization-empowered computing, and Quality of Service (QoS)-aware control can drive Cloud-Fog Automation towards a fully autonomous ICPS, while accounting for system-wide cyber-physical security.}

	abstract = {Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) have emerged as a critical component in the industrial domain. To facilitate seamless collaboration among massive devices, cloud-edge computing architectures have emerged as a key enabler for ICPS, leveraging distributed intelligence to orchestrate devices and computational tasks. In cloud-edge computing, efficient task offloading and resource management are essential for optimizing task performance and reducing energy costs. However, conventional centralized resource management strategies struggle to satisfy the real-time, adaptability, and performance demands of dynamic ICPS systems. In this paper, we propose the Distributed Transformer-based Actor-Critic (DTAC) algorithm to jointly determine task offloading and resource management decisions in cloud-edge computing networks, particularly for delay-sensitive applications in ICPS. The DTAC algorithm integrates the powerful transformer model with the popular actor-critic architecture to address the challenge of a hybrid high-dimensional action space. We first train a centralized model to learn coordination among user equipments (UEs) and then introduce a decentralized transfer learning (TL) approach to efficiently adapt the centralized model into the DTAC framework. Using the DTAC model, each UE can independently manage its local resources based solely on local information, avoiding the significant signaling overhead inherent in centralized approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that DTAC not only outperforms other MARL and TL schemes in both small- and large-scale scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities in inexperienced settings. Furthermore, DTAC and decentralized TL approaches significantly reduce training costs by 73% compared to other methods, making them more practical for ICPS deployment.}

	abstract = {The emergence of new time-sensitive networking (TSN) technologies empowers almost-deterministic ultra-reliable low-latency communications for industrial cloud-fog automation paradigms. However, current heterogeneous networks struggle to balance time-sensitivity and flexibility, particularly in mixed-flow scenarios. Existing scheduling approaches within 5G-TSN integration model either suffer from quality of service (QoS) flow mismatch or microbursts. This paper proposes a class-aware mixed-flow scheduling (CAMFS) strategy to enable domain-specific resource allocation in a hybrid wired-wireless TSN, while meeting the differentiated time-sensitive (TS) requirements. A time-triggered multiple cyclic-queuing (TTMCQ) shaper is designed to effectively align the classified and regulated mixed flows from TSN domains to 5G QoS flows through class-aware mapping. We also introduce an anti-starvation resource optimization method that minimizes the total average idle resources resulting from temporal-spatial resource over-provisioning within reserved TS windows (RTWs). Additionally, we present a CAMFS algorithm aimed at enhancing schedulability and resource utilization by sorting mixed flows based on a combination of flow features. Finally, simulation results show that CAMFS exhibits outstanding scheduling performance in terms of end-to-end service latency, scheduling success ratio, and normalized resource distribution compared to other state-of-the-art methods.}

To meet this demand, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is promoting the integration of 5th Generation Mobile Communication Technology (5G) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Time synchronization is essential for deterministic data transmission. Based on the 3GPP’s vision of the 5G and TSN integrated networking with interoperability, we improve the time synchronization of TSN to conquer the multi-gNB competition, re-transmission, and mobility problems for the integrated 5G time synchronization. We implemented the improvement mechanisms and systematically validated the performance of 5G+TSN time synchronization. Based on the simulation in 500m x 500m industrial environments, the improved time synchronization achieved a precision of 1 microsecond with interoperability between 5G nodes and TSN nodes.}

	abstract = {Given the delay-critical nature of AI-driven industrial automation applications, industrial cyber-physical systems are evolving from centralized cloud automation to decentralized cloud-fog automation to reduce model inference delay. However, traditional centralized deep federated learning is not well-suited for this evolution, primarily due to scalability and delay issues caused by centralized parameter synchronization. Thus, we introduce a decentralized deep federated learning (DDFL) architecture. While DDFL resolves scalability and delay concerns, decentralized parameter synchronization amplifies the delay imbalance impact caused by uneven computing and network loads. Additionally, traditional single-task load balancing approaches with fixed load balancing weights face challenges posed by diverse delay requirements across different model training tasks. To overcome these challenges, we formulate a hybrid multi-task Markov decision process with the objective of minimizing flexibly weighted computing and network load. We further propose a hybrid multi-task deep reinforcement learning (MTDRL) scheme based on the importance-weighted actor-learner architecture, which trains a hybrid-MTDRL decision model to select fog servers and paths with balanced loads suited to diverse delay requirements. Realistic trace-based simulation and testbed evaluation results demonstrate that hybrid-MTDRL outperforms benchmarks in load balancing and reducing training delay.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of Industry 4.0, time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as the new infrastructure for future industrial Internet of Things (IoT) communication. Ensuring the compatibility between TSN and legacy networks is inevitable. The ideal compatibility is to achieve deterministic interconnection and interoperability without changes in hardware and communication protocols, in other words, only using standard devices with software management. This paper targets the ideal compatibility of TSN and Profinet Isochronous Real Time (IRT). First, we propose an inter-domain multiple transmission opportunity mechanism (MTOM) to enable the asynchronous converged network of TSN and Profinet. The mechanism reserves multiple transmission time slots for cross-domain data flows to reduce their end-to-end delay and jitter. Second, we formulate an asynchronous scheduling model (ASM) based on MTOM to co-schedule flows in inter-and-intra domains. Finally, a case study is performed on a typical industrial network. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MTOM can only use standard devices to achieve deterministic transmission of Profinet and TSN converged networks. Compared with previous asynchronous converged networks, the delay and jitter are reduced by 86% and 80% on average, respectively.}

	abstract = {As an evolution of cloud radio access network (C-RAN), fog radio access network (F-RAN) becomes promising for future mobile communications by enabling processing and caching at fog access points (FAPs). Different from the centralised C-RAN, F-RAN has a semi-distributed architecture, aiming to alleviate traffic load on the fronthaul links in C-RAN. Under the semi-distributed architecture in F-RAN, which employs a cell-free multiple input multiple output (MIMO) access technique, decisions on the joint user-FAP association and transmit power allocation are made at individual FAPs. To mitigate strong interference, FAPs will need to exchange cooperative status information, such as CSI, user association details or transmission power levels. However, this can lead to significant communication overhead within the network and introduce high complexity in the decision-making process. In this paper, accounting for the semi-distributed nature of the F-RAN architecture, reinforcement learning is leveraged as a potential solution to this kind of problem, and a novel multi-agent dual deep Q-network (MA-DDQN) algorithm is proposed by introducing experience exchange in partially observable Markov decision process environments. The simulation results show that the proposed reinforcement learning based algorithm outperforms the DDQN algorithm as well as the existing low-complexity algorithms.}

To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.}

Progressive goal-oriented (GO) communication is a promising technology to tackle the above challenges. This paper takes a two-step approach to design the first progressive codec of GO communications tailored for RL control tasks. The first step is to design a variable-rate coding scheme that extends the boundaries of rate regimes. This step is achieved by empowering the hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) framework with novel algorithms such as mutual information based soft state abstraction (MISA). The second step is to transform variable-rate encoding into progressive encoding. This is achieved by applying residual-based encoding techniques upon latent representations learned by deep neural networks. Experiments on the Cartpole Swingup task demonstrate that the proposed progressive codec can facilitate smooth transitions from the ultra-low rate regime to regular rate regime, while achieving the state-of-the-art performance in terms of rate-distortion-effectiveness tradeoff.}

	abstract = {As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the ever-increasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

This paper proposes a goal-oriented joint power and multiple sub-bands allocation policy for interference coordination in 6G in-factory subnetworks. Current methods for interference coordination in subnetworks only focus on optimizing communication metrics, such as the block error rate, without considering the goal of the controlled plants. This oversight often leads to inefficient allocation of the limited radio resources. To address this, we devise a novel decentralized inter-subnetwork interference coordination policy optimized using a Bayesian framework to ensure the long-term stability of the subnetwork-controlled plants. Our results show that the proposed decentralized method can support more than twice the density of subnetwork-controlled plants compared to centralized schemes that aim to minimize the block error rate while reducing execution complexity significantly.}

However, the conflict between limited computing resources and extensive sampling data, combined with severe industrial interference, exacerbates the system’s processing burden and diminishes its accuracy, hindering its ability to meet the low-latency and high-reliability control requirements. To address this issue, this paper investigates an end-edge collaborative control framework to enhance control performance for a short-packet transmission ICPS by providing powerful computation capability. We utilize the age of information (AoI) to characterize the impact of information freshness on control accuracy and construct an AoI-aware control law to assist in data sensing, transmission, and computing strategy design. In addition, we consider the influence of sampling and short-packet decoding errors in AoI-aware control performance to enhance the reliability of sampling and transmission strategies design. A joint optimization scheme of sampling interval, sampling time, computation offloading, and bandwidth allocation based on the block coordinate descent method and game theory is proposed to achieve a tradeoff between the control cost and energy consumption. By considering a real-world trolley inverted pendulum manipulation model, numerical results verify the performance gain of the proposed end-edge collaborative framework and the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.}

	abstract = {The timely exchange of information among robots within a team is vital, but it can be constrained by limited wireless capacity. The inability to deliver information promptly can result in estimation errors that impact collaborative efforts among robots. In this paper, we propose a new metric termed Loss of Information Utility (LoIU) to quantify the freshness and utility of information critical for cooperation. The metric enables robots to prioritize information transmissions within bandwidth constraints. We also propose the estimation of LoIU using belief distributions and accordingly optimize both transmission schedule and resource allocation strategy for device-to-device transmissions to minimize the time-average LoIU within a robot team. A semi-decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework is developed, where each robot functions as an actor responsible for scheduling transmissions among its collaborators while a central critic periodically evaluates and refines the actors in response to mobility and interference. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an enhancement of information freshness and utility by 98%, compared to alternative methods.}

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of 6G, cloud-fog computing, and internet of things (IoT) has revolutionized the control paradigm of smart grid. With the closed coupling between communication and power domains, control performance heavily relies on timely and secure sensing, transmission, and computing of grid state information. Conventional approaches which treat the four sectors as separate subsystems suffer from slow convergence and even cascading control oscillations. In this paper, we address the key research problem of sensing-transmission-computing-control integrated optimization to minimize the overall voltage deviation. A timeliness-driven integrated optimization algorithm is proposed, where proactive optimization of communication resource adaptation and power-domain control decisions is conducted based on the evolution of information timeliness loss in sensing, transmission, and computing, as well as its impact on control accuracy. Particularly, a self-penalty based cost function is developed to quantify the mismatch between communication-domain resource allocation and voltage control deviation. Moreover, a novel timeliness indicator, named age of trustworthy information (AoTI), is introduced to capture timeliness-trustworthiness performance loss on proportional-integral (PI) consensus control stability margin. Consensus weights are optimized based on AoTI to further enhance convergence speed and improve control accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves power-domain control stability, validating the efficiency of AoTI as a critical indicator for control information importance.}

	abstract = {This work studies the challenge of scheduling real-time control commands in Networked Control Systems (NCS), where control actions rely on the freshness of data collected from multiple sources. In dynamic environments, ensuring that control commands in an NCS are accurate and frequent is essential for maintaining the system responsiveness. For this aim, we introduce a new metric, Age of Result (AoR), which quantifies the time elapsed since the last control command was generated and executed. This metric reflects the system’s capability to adapt to real-time changes in the operational environment by considering both data freshness and control command frequency. We conduct a detailed analysis of AoR in NCS, paying special attention to the dependencies between sensing and computing phases. We first address computation-intensive and network-intensive scenarios, proposing random sampling (RS)-based approximate algorithms for each case. Subsequently, we develop another RS-based algorithm and a heuristic approach for the general model. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively minimize AoR and significantly enhance the system performance and real-time adaptability compared to existing strategies.}

	abstract = {Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPSs) have been motivating various Industry 4.0 endeavours, particularly with the integration of fog computing. Cloud-fog data caching paradigms, as supportive elements of ICPSs, have been adopted to cache user data, catering to diverse ICPS requirements such as data sensitivity and reduced access latency. In this hierarchical caching context, ensuring Cloud-Fog Data Integrity (CFDI) is crucial for maintaining the consistent functionality of ICPSs. Existing solutions primarily focus on examining the integrity of data cached solely on either cloud or fog nodes. However, cloud-cached data and fog-cached data are tightly coupled and should be considered simultaneously when checking data integrity. In this work, we introduce an over-the-air CFDI verification scheme, namely AirDIV, with a high accuracy and security guarantee. Instead of aggregating integrity proofs after proof transmission, AirDIV completes proof aggregation and transmission over the air for efficiency improvement. To enhance practicability, we derive adjustable parameters and formulate an optimization problem to minimize over-the-air aggregation errors. Furthermore, with an effective proof generation method, AirDIV can defend against two common attacks, i.e., replay and forge attacks. We provide a theoretical analysis of AirDIV’s correctness, accuracy and security, while conducting extensive experiments on both simulated and real platforms to validate its efficiency.}

	abstract = {The Cloud-Fog Automation is a newly proposed digital industrial automation architecture aimed at accelerating the integration and collaboration of communication, computing, and control towards next-generation cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Data reliability is one of the key considerations for achieving Cloud-Fog Automation. Sensor nodes serve as infrastructures for data collection within industrial CPSs and are essential for maintaining ultra-high data reliability. However, the underlying sensor nodes communicate frequently, are damage-prone and difficult to identify, which dramatically shortens the network lifetime and poses great challenges to data reliability. Motivated by this fact, this paper co-designs communication architecture, algorithms, and computing models for next-generation industrial CPSs with Cloud-Fog Automation to ensure data reliability and functional security. First, a four-layer energy-efficient communication architecture is proposed and a cluster head computing algorithm based on double deep Q-learning (CH-DDQ) is designed inside the architecture. Besides, a 2-stage hyBrid fault detection scheme (2-Brain) is proposed for underlying sensor nodes. 2-Brain first incorporates the Obstacle Triple Jump Protocol (OTP) and OTP packets to improve hard fault detection performance. Then, an unsupervised sensor reading soft fault detection model (SR-SFD) based on contrastive learning, momentum, and tensor is adopted to learn discriminative representations of sensor readings and identify soft faults. Simulations and a case study in the nuclear power industry manifest CH-DDQ improves the network lifetime by 5.4%~484.3% compared to three peer methods, and OTP performs better than baselines by 33.1% on average. Additionally, SR-SFD exhibits high efficiency in sensor soft fault detection and other application scenarios.}

	abstract = {In the era of smart cyber-physical grid, dynamic insecurity risk has become a significant concern due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and the inherent uncertainties in smart grid. Dynamic security assessment (DSA) has been adopted to hedge against such risks by estimating the stability of large-scale smart grids. Existing DSA approaches often involve complex high dimensional models which incur high communication and computational costs, hindering their practical adoption. In this paper, we address these limitations with the Quantum Federated Ensembled Variational Adaptive Learning (QFEVAL) approach for smart grid DSA. QFEVAL is designed to combine quantum machine learning and federated learning to handle the differential-algebraic equations that describe smart grid stability, providing an efficient way to deal with high-dimensional data and uncertainties. QFEVAL enables the training of the hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on distributed DSA datasets located at different nodes in smart grids, without requiring large numbers of parameters to be transmitted. QFEVAL accurately predicts the stability of the smart grid under various conditions, enabling the implementation of preventive stability control measures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that QFEVAL achieves comparable performance to 9 state-of-the-art DSA approaches with more than 2 orders of magnitude fewer model parameter transmissions. QFEVAL paves the way for reliable, secure, and continuous electricity supply, offering a robust solution to the challenges of DSA in smart grids.}

We consider a secure ISAC design by adopting the proposed secrecy rate and secrecy Cramér-Rao bound (S-CRB) metrics under the bounded CSI errors model. The joint design of artificial noise (AN) and dual-functional radar communications (DFRC) signals beamforming as well as subcarrier allocation is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate, while ensuring the hierarchical confidentiality requirements for users and satisfying the leakage CRB constraint for the target. To handle the non-convex problem, we devise a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA)-based suboptimal algorithm, and its   \\varepsilon  ε \\varepsilon   -optimality is validated via our proposed branch and bound (B&B) algorithm in simulations. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme compared to the other baselines. Moreover, the inherent win-win relationship between the sum secrecy rate and target S-CRB is demonstrated via various simulation results, which provides several insights into secure MC-NOMA ISAC network deployment.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are the core of industrial production. Wireless technology, with its flexibility and adaptability, is catalyzing a transformative shift from traditional ICS to the advanced Industrial Wireless Control Systems (IWCSs). However, the openness of wireless media, high dynamics of the environment, and resource scarcity present unprecedented security challenges of high security defense costs and low detection inaccuracy for IWCS. State-of-the-art methods primarily treat ICS as a typical cyber-physical system, which focuses on security issues from the cyber and control domains, rather than the physical domain. As a result, they are unable to fully address the high dynamics of wireless channels and unknown attacks, ultimately failing to meet the stringent security requirements of industrial systems. To this end, this paper proposes a physical-domain whitelist as the final line of security defense leveraging the finite nature of the physical behavior space in industrial production systems. Moreover, a holistic cross-domain security-safety architecture is introduced, drawing inspiration from the integrated cyber-control-physical collaboration. In the proposed architecture, the top-down inherent security-safety defense and bottom-up risk backtracking form a close loop, which not only prevents unknown attacks but also facilitates rapid localization and response to attacks. In the experiment, the composite AGV scheduling control has been developed to verify the effectiveness of the architecture. Ultimately, the potential challenges of the cross-domain architecture for IWCS safety-security defense have been summarized.}

	abstract = {Cloud-fog automation architecture has propelled the advancement of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), significantly enhancing production efficiency and intelligence through extensive data collection and connectivity. Simultaneously, industrial cyber-physical system leverages this data to achieve intelligent control and optimization of production processes. As industrial production becomes increasingly specialized and complex, independent operations within a single domain are no longer sufficient to meet demands, making cross-domain collaborative production inevitable. Consequently, ensuring the security of cross-domain communication and data sharing has become a critical issue for IIoT under the cloud-fog automation architecture. Existing solutions encounter substantial management and computational burdens in cross-domain communication and data sharing, and they are vulnerable to privacy leakage risks. To address these challenges and enhance industrial production efficiency, this paper uses consortium blockchain to co-design a cross-domain authentication and data sharing scheme. The scheme ensures secure and private cross-domain communications with minimal computational, communication, and storage overhead. And, the proposed time-specific plaintext checkable encryption protocol can secure data during cross-domain sharing. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme effectively reduces computational and communication resource demands while maintaining communication and data security.}

Our detailed field study on auto glass industry revealed that existing production lines are laborious to reconfigure, difficult to upscale, and costly to upgrade during production switching. Such inflexibility arises from the tight coupling of devices, controllers, and control tasks. In this work, we propose a new architecture for industrial control systems named Control-as-a-Service (CaaS). CaaS transfers and distributes control tasks from dedicated controllers into network switches. By combining control and transmission functions in switches, CaaS virtualizes the whole industrial network to one Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). We propose a set of techniques that realize end-to-end determinism for in-network industrial control and a joint task and traffic scheduling algorithm. We evaluate the performance of CaaS on testbeds based on real-world networked control systems. The results show that the idea of CaaS is feasible and effective, and CaaS achieves absolute packet delivery, 42-45% lower latency, and three orders of magnitude lower jitter. We believe CaaS is a meaningful step towards the distribution, virtualization, and servitization of industrial control.}

	abstract = {Wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) are critical to Industry 4.0, enabling applications like drone swarms and autonomous robots. The tight interdependence between communication and control demands integrated design, yet traditional approaches treat them separately, leading to inefficiencies. Existing codesign methods often rely on simplified models for single-loop or independent multi-loop systems, overlooking the complexities of large-scale WNCSs. These include coupled control loops, time-correlated wireless channels, sensing-control trade-offs, and computational challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a practical WNCS model that captures correlated dynamics among spatially distributed sensors and actuators sharing limited wireless resources over multi-state Markov block-fading channels. To solve the resulting high-dimensional codesign problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that scales efficiently by managing hybrid action spaces, capturing communication-control dependencies, and maintaining robust performance under time-correlated dynamics and resource constraints. Simulations demonstrate that our DRL approach outperforms benchmarks, providing a scalable and effective solution for large-scale industrial WNCSs.}

	abstract = {Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), renowned for its deterministic properties, has become a pivotal technology underpinning real-time industrial control in Cyber-Physical Systems. Existing research emphasizes enhancing the transmission services of TSN networks for control applications by improving flow schedulability and minimizing end-to-end delay. However, these studies abstract the performance requirements of control applications into rigid, impractical constraints for flow scheduling, disrupting the connection between control optimization and transmission enhancement, and eventually undermining genuine progress in industrial control. Within a co-optimization framework of communication and control, this paper proposes AFS-RT, an Adaptive TSN Flow Scheduling method for Robotic arm Teleoperation, a representative industrial control application. Specifically, through a comprehensive analysis of the teleoperation case, we first integrate slot allocation-based flow scheduling with remote control to formulate a control-driven co-optimization model. To tackle the complexities arising from the implicit mapping between communication and control, we augment the Deep Reinforcement Learning agent responsible for slot allocation with slot-correlation-guided feature extraction, improving feature comprehension by leveraging inherent correlations between slots and thereby boosting the agent’s decision-making capabilities. Extensive testbed and simulation experiments demonstrate that AFS-RT significantly improves teleoperation performance under diverse network conditions compared to SOTA algorithms.}

	abstract = {In recent decades, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have received great attention due to their broad applications. This paper investigates CPS deployment in remote areas, specifically focusing on a digital twin-empowered autonomous robotic system. The system consists of a multifunctional autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), sensors, and actuators. The AAV carries communication and computing modules, acting as an edge information hub (EIH) that connects sensors and actuators—forming reflex-arc-like sensing-communication-computing-control (  \\mathbf {SC}^{3} \\mathbf {SC}^{3}  ) loops. A digital twin is integrated into the EIH to emulate the system’s behavior and assist in the decision-making. To alleviate resource limitations in remote areas, we propose a goal-oriented closed-loop optimization scheme. The proposed scheme takes the   \\mathbf {SC}^{3} \\mathbf {SC}^{3}   loop as an integrated structure and jointly optimizes uplink and downlink (UL&DL) communication and computing resources to minimize the total linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we derive the closed-form solution for intra-loop allocation and propose an efficient iterative algorithm for inter-loop optimization. Under the condition of adequate CPU frequency, we derive an approximate closed-form solution for inter-loop bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme, which achieves a two-tier task-level balance within and across the   \\mathbf {SC}^{3} \\mathbf {SC}^{3}   loops.}

	abstract = {Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have made significant strides in recent years, driving the future of manufacturing. However, for further advancement in Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA), several challenges remain: rigid sensor sampling, inflexible communication configurations, insufficient coordination between cloud and fog resources, and a lack of integration between sensing, communication, and computing for effective control. To address these issues, this article presents SeCo4, an intelligent control framework for the co-design of sensing, communication, and computing in industrial CPS. The SeCo4 optimization problem is analyzed and divided into two sub-problems: a multi-controller cloud resource competition problem, formulated with a combinatorial auction to enable multi-controller competition for additional cloud resources and improve control performance; and a joint resource optimization problem for sensing, communication, and computing, modeled using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem to minimize control costs. Given the interdependence of these sub-problems, a hierarchical solution based on the online matching mechanism and the heuristic approach is developed to iteratively find the optimal solution. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {With the development of Industry 4.0, mobile agents are deployed to coordinate with multi-loop control systems to perform manufacturing tasks, leading to heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT). Due to shadow fading induced by the movement of mobile agents, the wireless channel closing the control loops is inherently unreliable, which can compromise the control system performance. This paper addresses the co-design problem of transmission scheduling and agents’ movement to ensure both control performance and energy efficiency. A generalized cyber-physical-agent framework is proposed to capture the coupling between IoT systems and a mobile agent through a state-dependent fading channel. Moreover, the movement of the mobile agent among areas exhibiting different levels of shadow effects is modeled by Markov decision process. To address such heterogeneous dynamics, the co-design problem is formulated into the optimization of a logic-based stochastic switched system by utilizing the semi-tensor product technique. Based on state mergence and   \\mathcal {H} \\mathcal {H}  -representation methods, a tractable and effective algorithm is then proposed to design co-design policies, minimizing the average joint cost of communication and control. A parallel scheme is further developed to alleviate the computation burden of the algorithm. Theoretical guarantees are provided to ensure control system performance. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {The problem of sensor scheduling under resource constraints in remote state estimation systems has been extensively studied in the past. While many sophisticated scheduling policies have been proposed, practically most wireless sensors operate in the simple strictly periodic pattern for sampling and packet transmission. In this paper, from an energy-efficiency perspective that jointly considers remote estimation accuracy and sensor energy consumption, we provide a rigorous explanation that a strictly periodic sensor scheduling policy can arbitrarily approximate the optimal energy-efficient policy. From this foundation, we explicitly characterize the optimal periodic scheduling, underscoring that: 1) There exists a unique strictly periodic scheduling policy which is optimal among all periodic policies; 2) An exact expression of the optimal period of the strictly periodic policy is derived, which is solely dependent on the packet dropout rate of the communication channel and the spectral radius of the system matrix. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.}

	abstract = {Filtering refers to the methods for inferring time-varying parameters and is a crucial task in cyber-physical systems. An important category of filtering is distributed filtering, where sensor nodes transmit observations via communication links to inference nodes that estimate the unknown states. Distributed filtering is challenging in the sense that the communication constraint of the sensor nodes limits the amount of information available to the inference node, calling for the co-design of communication and computing. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for the co-design of communication and computing in distributed filtering, building on an information-theoretic view of the Kalman-Bucy filtering. In particular, this paper considers a networked system consisting of two nodes, where each node aims to infer its own time-varying state in continuous-time scenarios. The two nodes are connected by a Gaussian feedback channel. Via the feedback link, one of the nodes can obtain the sensor observations and received signals of the other node. This paper develops an optimal linear strategy, namely the information difference encoding strategy, for generating signals transmitted via the Gaussian feedback channel. This paper also presents an inequality that relates Shannon information with Fisher information in distributed filtering. The inference accuracy and power efficiency of the information difference encoding strategy are quantified via simulations.}

	abstract = {In automated warehouses, efficient management and economic benefits hinge on the effective scheduling of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to transport diverse packets. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation control have greatly contributed to the development of packet transport schemes for AGVs. However, the development of the logistics industry results in a massive amount of packets with diverse deadlines, which brings new challenges for the AGV scheduling system. To address this, this paper treats each AGV as an agent and designs a novel hierarchical transformer reinforcement learning (HTRL) framework to generate efficient AGV scheduling policies. Specifically, this framework consists of one encoder and two decoders to produce the packet selection and path improvement actions. These two decoders are equipped with masked self-attention mechanisms to learn efficient packet selection and path improvement policies, facilitating AGV transport efficiency to meet the deadlines of packets. Moreover, we consider the kinetic features of AGVs and design a model predictive control (MPC)-based speed control method for AGVs to prevent frequent stop-and-wait of AGVs and enhance their transport efficiency. We build up a simulated warehouse environment containing packets with different deadlines and conduct extensive experiments. Experimental results validate that the proposed HTRL framework increases the delivered packets within expiration by up to 36.6% compared to other baselines.}

	abstract = {Inadequate resource coordination and control can result in poor quality of experience (QoE) for user devices in heterogeneous edge-enabled cyber-physical systems. Unfortunately, in a cooperative edge network, existing studies have rarely jointly optimized communication, computing resources, and batch size for QoE guarantee when controlling task offloading. To this end, we investigate the problem of harnessing bandwidth, computation, and batch size for fair quality of experience (HARBOR) in a practical collaborative edge-AI environment, where UEs have different accuracy requirements of inference services and edge devices possess different batch processing capabilities. Specifically, we introduce the task completion efficiency as the task-completion-time-to-deadline ratio to quantify individual QoE. Then, we formulate the problem HARBOR as a mixed integer nonlinear programming with constraints of accuracy, bandwidth, computation, task hard deadlines and so on. The objective is to minimize the maximum task completion efficiency among all tasks to achieve task-level fairness. After providing the NP-hardness proof for HARBOR, we then devise an efficient scheme named e-HARBOR with a competitive ratio guarantee, to solve the decoupled sub-problems of HARBOR with calibrated long short-term memory network for resource prediction. Both testbed and simulation experiments evidently demonstrate that the proposed scheme works efficiently and scales well compared to baselines.}

These networks must simultaneously satisfy critical QoS metrics while maintaining adaptability to fluctuations in resource availability and task priorities. To address the industrial demands for real-time responsiveness, lightweight design, and flexible deployment, this paper proposes an adaptive deployment optimization strategy for edge intelligent networks based on an improved K-means particle swarm optimization (IK-PSO) algorithm. The strategy incorporates dynamic clustering and weight adjustment mechanisms to optimize multiple performance metrics, including latency, throughput, reliability, and interference mitigation. Experimental results validate that the IK-PSO-based deployment optimization strategy rapidly converges to high-quality solutions across different scenarios and various factory complexities, significantly improving network performance.

	abstract = {The expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), driven by informatization and intelligence, has made real-time monitoring for ensuring system safety and efficient production more critical than ever. However, in extreme industrial environments, harsh communication conditions and limited computing power impede reliable data transmission and processing, thus posing significant challenges to precise and continuous monitoring for massive IIoT. To this end, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-enabled hierarchical monitoring scheme by fully considering communication, computing, and control (3C) collaboration. Specifically, we first propose a DT-enabled 3C collaboration architecture, which builds an accurate digital representation of physical entities, and then completes the missing state based on shared-specific features to evolve continuously across the device lifecycle. Next, we design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based collaborative monitoring method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of compression rate and region assignment for monitoring nodes according to 3C performance. Then, we propose a mask state-assisted MARL scheduling method to refine the mask state space, take advantage of MARL’s distributed decision-making and centralized evaluation, and ensure timely monitoring of massive IIoT. Finally, we build a mine industry simulation platform and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate a marked improvement in monitoring utility over traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been extensively applied in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) to develop powerful models for complex industrial tasks (e.g., fault diagnosis), while safeguarding industrial data confidentiality. Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) effectively mitigates the straggler issue in the synchronous paradigm by aggregating client models in a first-come-first-served manner. Proper client selection is crucial for achieving efficient model training in AFL. A widely adopted model for implementing client selection in AFL is multi-armed bandit (MAB), which models client selection as arm pulling. Existing MAB-based client selection schemes overlook practical scenarios where direct client-server communications are unfavorable or unavailable (for example, in ICPSs such as mines, where communication infrastructure is underdeveloped, direct client-server communication is often unreliable or even unfeasible). In such cases, the server needs to incentivize self-interested relays to perform arm-pulling actions, including selecting the right client and relaying the communication from the selected client to the server. This paper proposes the first framework of incentivized online client selection for AFL. The design and optimization of such a framework involve significant challenges due to the tight coupling between unknown client behavior and private relay cost. To circumvent this challenge, we adopt the dual-based method and construct a special Lagrangian function that incorporates client behavior learning and relay cost revelation, and utilize it to design a socially-optimal mechanism for the framework. Our mechanism satisfies several desirable properties, including voluntary participation, incentive compatibility, relay utilization fairness, and client participation fairness. The proposed mechanism achieves the same asymptotic performance as the state-of-the-art benchmark that requires additional information. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more available relays bring our mechanism closer to the theoretical upper bound of social performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism achieves up to 85% and 99% of the social welfare obtained by the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) with cloud-fog automation calls for the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices to enable intelligent and autonomous decision-making. However, the resource constraints, heterogeneity, and dynamic nature of edge devices pose limitations to the efficient deployment of DNNs. Federated Learning-based Neural Architecture Search (FL-NAS) has been proposed to address these limitations, but achieving an effective balance between the generalized global model and personalized local models remains a non-trivial task due to suboptimal aggregation of homogeneous neural blocks, knowledge waste of heterogeneous neural blocks, and high communication and energy overhead. In this paper, we propose   F^{2}NAS F^{2}NAS  , an energy-friendly federated neural architecture search framework tailored for ICPS. The fine-grained aggregation strategy adapts weights for each device during aggregation, enhancing the global and personalized local models. The bidirectional knowledge transfer mechanism leverages heterogeneous neural blocks, promoting knowledge sharing among local and global models. The adaptive communication strategy optimizes interactions between edge devices and the cloud server based on model performance, reducing energy costs while maintaining effective model collaboration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that   F^{2}NAS F^{2}NAS   outperforms baselines by up to 30.31% in accuracy on edge devices, 38.75% on the cloud server, and achieves a 65.2% reduction in energy consumption. When applied to the surface defect detection task in ICPS,   F^{2}NAS F^{2}NAS   surpasses other baselines by up to 13.38% and 302.46% for edge devices and cloud servers, respectively, and reduces energy consumption by 44.8%.}

This paper extends the vision of Cloud/Fog Automation to scalable robotics, which is deployed across the device-edge-cloud continuum using cloud-native technologies and calls for a co-design methodology that jointly considers communication, compute, and application characteristics. From an industrial practitioner’s viewpoint, we demonstrate its feasibility with a comprehensive approach to optimizing a mobile robot application. We leverage a dual-phase optimization strategy: static optimization pre-deployment and dynamic optimization post-deployment. In the static optimization phase, we employ a profiling-based method to minimize communication overhead while balancing computational load. The dynamic optimization phase utilizes a reinforcement learning-based approach to explore an optimal policy for computation offloading and network quality of service configuration to maximize edge server utilization and lower network usage costs while guaranteeing application performance. Experimental results, validated through a Simulation-to-Reality (Sim-to-Real) approach, demonstrate that our co-design method significantly enhances operational efficiency, reduces network costs, and improves overall system responsiveness.}

	abstract = {Immersive communication is regarded as a key driver in the evolution of Virtual Reality technologies. To offer immersive experiences, 360° video edge caching has become an effective solution for minimizing latency to popular content. In order to find the optimal placement for 360° video caching, numerous conventional optimization approaches or deep learning methods have been proposed. However, conventional optimization is computationally expensive and unsuitable for online decision-making, while relying solely on deep learning methods can not guarantee the optimality and feasibility of the solutions, such as whether solutions satisfy the constraints of the original caching problem. In this paper, a dual-engine intelligent caching framework that combines operations research and deep reinforcement learning is proposed for 360° video edge caching and content prefetching. This framework introduces a shared hierarchical caching architecture and formulates a global shared caching placement problem. Adopting a cutting-edge pruning approach, the local cache replacement algorithm is proposed. This utilizes deep reinforcement learning to predict cache boundaries, which are then used to prune the search space of integer linear programming efficiently. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme provides significantly improved performance relative to alternative caching schemes.}

	abstract = {Real-time industrial video analytics is widely applied across diverse domains within cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS devices equipped with networked cameras are wirelessly connected to servers for complex vision-based analytics and intelligent operations. Adaptive video streaming is a pivotal technique in these applications to effectively deliver video content to servers under varying network conditions, enabling complex analytics afterward. Our thorough data analysis reveals that conventional offline video streaming control policies cannot effectively adapt to the high dynamics in networks and industrial video scenes. This results in suboptimal analytic performance and necessitates online adaptation for streaming control policy models. Yet, updating control policy models requires ground-truth analytics results which are unavailable directly on end devices due to their limited capacity. Furthermore, naively streaming original videos to the server for online adaptation is greatly challenged by scarce and dynamic networks, leading to decreased accuracy and increased transmission costs. In this paper, we present RIVA, a novel Online Learning-enabled adaptive streaming framework for Real-time Industrial Video Analytics. To facilitate communication-efficient online retraining, we design a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach in which the upper-level module intelligently determines the timing for online retraining, balancing Quality of Service (QoS) improvement and communication cost. Meanwhile, the lower-level module dynamically allocates bitrate to maximize QoS. Extensive experiments based on real-world industrial video and network datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a 22.6% mean accuracy increase, a 64.9% decrease in the mean failure rate of video uploading, and a 60.2% mean latency decrease compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {The integration of edge computing with deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial for intelligent industrial cyber-physical systems. Typically, deploying DNNs on heterogeneous edge devices relies on methods like model compression and partitioning. However, these approaches often result in homogeneous models across devices. This homogeneity limits the collective capability of edge computing systems, particularly in terms of generalization to diverse data distributions and adaptation to dynamic industrial environments. In this work, we propose to treat each DNN on an edge device as an independent model, aggregating their capabilities via ensemble learning to enhance generalization and dynamic adaptability. To realize this, we introduce the Adaptive Ensemble Knowledge Distillation Framework (AEKDF), combining cloud-based model training with edge computing based collaborative inference. In the cloud, AEKDF develops an enhanced Born Again Network that generates diverse, lightweight models tailored to specific edge devices through knowledge distillation. This process ensures model diversity which is critical to effective ensemble learning. On the edge, AEKDF employs an adaptive ensemble technique that aggregates prediction logits across devices, enabling rapid adaptation to changing environments and maintaining inference efficiency. Our extensive evaluations conducted on a realistic prototype demonstrate the substantial boost in predictive performance achieved by our AEKDF, showcasing a 4% to 10% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-100 compared to conventional single-model approaches, while maintaining low latency.}

	abstract = {Task-oriented integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) is a key technology for achieving low-latency edge inference and enabling efficient implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the constrained energy supply at edge devices has emerged as a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge devices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature quantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A joint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference accuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing inference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the impact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference performance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative algorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation problem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by respectively applying a golden section search method and checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a local optimum of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISCC design, showing a significant reduction in energy consumption of up to 40% compared to existing methods, particularly in low-latency scenarios.}

These challenges are particularly pronounced in healthcare, where high-priority, delay-sensitive medical tasks and large-scale personalized services face substantial obstacles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Self-Attention Enhanced QMIX with Multi-Pass Multi-Task Execution (SAE-MT-QMIX) algorithm, aimed at optimizing communication and computing resource allocation as well as task offloading strategies. By leveraging Digital Twin (DT) support, the algorithm achieves collaborative optimization of communication, computing, and control within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), significantly enhancing the quality of service for massive personalized applications. The algorithm adopts a distributed execution and centralized training framework: the distributed execution component uses the Multi-Pass Multi-Task Deep Q-Network (MPMT-DQN) algorithm to handle the complexity of parameterized action spaces in multi-task scenarios, while the centralized training component employs the Self-Attention Enhanced QMIX (SAE-QMIX) algorithm to dynamically optimize credit assignment across multiple users. Simulation results demonstrate that SAE-MT-QMIX significantly reduces delay and energy consumption compared to baseline methods. It ensures effective optimization of communication, computing, and control in dynamic IoMT, efficiently addressing diverse demands and tasks while enhancing service quality and system adaptability.}

To this end, the recent 802.11ax amendment introduced a preamble detection (PD)-based spatial reuse, allowing concurrent transmissions between adjacent links via adjustable sensitivity levels. Against these conventional ideas, this paper presents a different perspective: Wi-Fi devices already have excessive transmission (TX) opportunities in practice, even without detecting each other under certain scenarios. We shed light on CS anomalies relevant to undetected preambles, which not only cause adjacent devices to transmit concurrently but are also triggered by the new PD-based mechanism, ultimately disrupting its intended operations. Our testbed experiments and in-depth scrutiny reveal the dominant impact of these anomalies on overall network behaviors. Based on these insights, we present two comprehensive frameworks,   \\textsf {REFRAIN} \\textsf {REFRAIN}   and   \\textsf {AdOPT} \\textsf {AdOPT}  , to fully exploit TX opportunities enabled by the anomalies and PD-based mechanism respectively, for practical spatial reuse.

A key to the effective use of MLO for such cases rests on the optimal allocation of application traffic across multiple links. Our initial simulation experiments in ns-3 reveal that the proposed traffic allocation policies in prior art are significantly sub-optimal in terms of achievable delay performance of multi-link devices (MLDs), particularly in the presence of legacy single-link devices (SLDs). In this work, we first develop a new analytical model for the mean end-to-end (E2E) delay, delay jitter and worst-case percentile latency performance of MLD-SLD-coexisting Wi-Fi 7 networks (largely unexplored to date) with saturated and unsaturated SLD traffic. Subsequently, the optimal traffic allocation strategies for minimizing the mean E2E delay and delay jitter are obtained and validated by ns-3 simulation results. It is shown that with the optimal policy, MLDs can achieve significantly better mean E2E delay, delay jitter, worst-case latency and delay cumulative distribution function (CDF) compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately 50.44% faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching 98% of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over 63.32% in dense networks.}

	abstract = {The densification of Wi-Fi deployments means that fully distributed random channel access is no longer sufficient for high and predictable performance. Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.}

	abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 working group is currently finalizing the 802.11be amendment, which defines the features that will be supported by Wi-Fi 7 devices. A prominent new feature, termed Multi-Link Operations (MLO), is the ability for a device to operate on multiple links, i.e., on multiple frequency channels. Among the various MLO modes defined, Enhanced Multi-Link Single Radio (EMLSR) is attracting the interest of many vendors due to its potential for exploiting operations on multiple links through reduced hardware capabilities. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the standard specifications for EMLSR and describe the model underlying its implementation that we have contributed to the ns-3 simulator. The implemented model is rather flexible and enables to simulate various architectures differing for implementation cost, power consumption and performance. Then, we thoroughly evaluate several EMLSR configurations with the goal of shedding light on the possible alternatives that are available. We consider both a scenario of saturated conditions without interfering traffic and a scenario of non-saturated conditions with interfering traffic. Our study shows that the main differences in performance among the various EMLSR configurations are observed in the uplink direction and that EMLSR operations enable to reduce latency with respect to single-link devices at the cost of a slight increase in power consumption.}

	abstract = {The increasing demand for high-performance wireless communication, due to emerging applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and Internet-of-Things (IoT), has highlighted the need for enhanced Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication in Wi-Fi networks. P2P communication, often implemented through technologies like Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi Aware, plays a crucial role in enabling seamless device-to-device interaction. This paper explores two significant enhancements for improving P2P communication: enhancing base-channel P2P through the optimization of TXOP sharing for P2P groups, and improving off-channel P2P through multi-AP coordination for channel advertisement. First, we examine the enhancement of base-channel P2P communication by introducing a refined transmission opportunity (TXOP) sharing mechanism, where an AP allocates portions of its TXOP to P2P devices within a group. This allocation ensures that devices can transmit data within a controlled, synchronized framework, thereby reducing contention and improving overall throughput. Furthermore, the proposed improvements enable devices to efficiently share resources based on group-level needs, supporting latency-sensitive applications such as real-time media streaming. Second, we address the challenges of off-channel P2P communication in OBSS (Overlapping Basic Service Set) environments, where interference from neighboring networks can severely affect performance. Through multi-AP coordination, APs can advertise recommended P2P channels that minimize overlap with infrastructure operations, thereby providing cleaner and more reliable channels for P2P communication. In addition, this coordination also facilitates faster setup and more efficient operation of P2P links.}

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic shaping (PS) scheme to improve the spectrum and power efficiency in medium to high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime for Wi-Fi 8. The integration and compatibility with legacy Wi-Fi systems, as well as other Wi-Fi 8 candidate technologies like unequal modulation (UEQM) are addressed. An architecture with a single low-density parity-check (LDPC) encoder and multiple shaping encoders is devised to adapt to different qualities of spatial channels. Furthermore, we propose practical techniques to resolve issues like error propagation, scrambler re-synchronization, and packet length determination to ensure compatibility with legacy scrambling, subframe detection, and packaging flow. It is shown that the proposed constellation shaping scheme provides average 0.89 dB shaping gains over the legacy Wi-Fi scheme, and the shaping gains remain when UEQM and lifted LDPC are applied.}

	abstract = {Multi-band massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication can promote the cooperation of licensed and unlicensed spectra, effectively enhancing spectrum efficiency for Wi-Fi and other wireless systems. As an enabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as the channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel state information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent Generative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission where licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and transform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which converts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared characteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative networks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses to fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled networks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting synchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference process, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation accuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of   5~\\sim ~17 5 \xa0 ∼ \xa0 17 5~\\sim ~17   dB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability. We further show that the sum rate performance assisted by CF-CGN-based CF is close to that with perfect CSI for multi-band massive MIMO transmission.}

	abstract = {In radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) systems, mitigating channel interference remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces a robust RFFI system to tackle this issue effectively. Specifically, taking the IEEE 802.11 signal as the case study, a signal representation is designed based on the logarithmic spectrum, while an RFF extractor based on the U-Net neural network is employed which is guided by a proposed Channel2Channel (C2C) algorithm and powered by a designed data augmentation method. Furthermore, a collaborative identification mechanism is proposed based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, where a multi-frame RFF fusion method is designed to exploit the diversity across different frames of received signal. Extensive experimental evaluations are performed in various real-world scenarios using 7 mobile phones and a universal software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 receiver, where an average classification accuracy of 95.72% is obtained with a single frame of received signal, outperforming the neural network-based benchmarks, and an average accuracy of 99.46% is acquired with 10 signal frames based on the proposed collaborative identification method. In addition, the deployability of the system on a resource-constrained computing platform is also validated.}

	abstract = {Accurate 3D localization is essential for realizing advanced sensing functionalities in next-generation Wi-Fi communication systems. This study investigates the potential of multistatic localization in Wi-Fi networks through the deployment of multiple cooperative antenna arrays. The collaborative gain offered by these arrays is twofold: 1) intra-array coherent gain at the wavelength scale among antenna elements, and 2) inter-array cooperative gain across arrays. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of this approach, we develop WiCAL (Wi-Fi Collaborative Antenna Localization), a system built upon commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure equipped with uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). These arrays are driven by multiplexing embedded radio frequency (RF) chains available in standard access points or user devices, thereby eliminating the need for sophisticated, costly, and power-hungry multi-transceiver modules typically required in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To address phase offsets introduced by RF chain multiplexing, we propose a three-stage, fine-grained phase alignment scheme to synchronize signals across antenna elements within each array. A bidirectional spatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is employed to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and mitigate performance degradation caused by correlated interference. To further exploit inter-array cooperative gain, we elaborate on the synchronization mechanism among distributed URAs, which enables direct position determination by bypassing intermediate angle estimation. Once synchronized, the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array, significantly enhancing spatial resolution and localization accuracy. WiCAL is validated using  $3 \\times 4$  URAs operating at the 5.2 GHz band. Experimental results demonstrate median AoA estimation errors of 1° in elevation and 1.5° in azimuth under intra-array coherent processing. For inter-array collaboration, the system achieves a median localization error of 15.6 cm using two URAs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {WiFi-based gesture recognition (WGR) has emerged as a promising technology due to its potential for integration with communication systems under the concept of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current WGR systems face two primary challenges: limited scalability for recognizing new gestures and poor compatibility with ISAC. These systems typically require extensive data collection and retraining for each new gesture and struggle to handle the dimensional variability of channel state information (CSI) caused by fluctuating data traffic in communication networks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OneSense, a one-shot WGR system designed for seamless integration with communication systems. OneSense designs a data enrichment technique based on the law of signal propagation to generate virtual gestures. Based on enriched dataset, OneSense leverages an aug-meta learning (AML) framework to facilitate efficient and scalable FSL. OneSense also incorporates a data cropping strategy to enhance gesture feature prominence and a dynamic size-adaptive backbone model that ensures compatibility with CSI samples exhibiting dimensional inconsistencies. Experimental results show that OneSense achieves over 94% accuracy in one-shot gesture recognition. A case study further illustrates its effectiveness in ISAC contexts. Furthermore, our proposed AML framework reduces pre-training latency by more than 86% compared to conventional meta-learning approaches.}

	abstract = {As a technology with ubiquitous presence in unlicensed spectrum, Wi-Fi has demonstrated prominent capabilities in both communication and sensing. However, since the bandwidth requirements for communication and sensing differ significantly, channel bandwidths excessive for communication (e.g., 160 MHz) still fail to achieve multi-person sensing. Though stitching multiple consecutive channels to expand the effective bandwidth sounds plausible, it may never reach ultra-wideband (UWB) in practice. To this end, we propose UWB-Fi as a novel Wi-Fi sensing framework with ultra-wide bandwidth, leveraging only discrete and irregular channel samples. We first design a fast channel hopping scheme to enable arbitrary channel sampling across 4.7 GHz bandwidth on commodity Wi-Fi hardware without interrupting default communications. As no algorithm exists to exploit such channel samples, we establish a theoretical analysis driven by compressive sensing, so as to enable an explainable deep learning model. This model transforms sparse channel samples into high-dimensional (position) spectra, effectively avoiding the bias-variance dilemma in parameter estimation while encoding sufficient information for general sensing. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UWB-Fi successfully achieves centimeter-level fine-granularity multi-person sensing.}

	abstract = {The radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization in the region, particularly critical for unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sensors sparsely distributed in the region to infer a high-resolution radio map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, i.e., because the number of available samples is far fewer than the high resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion – a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best fine-grained radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.}

Every source node transmits a sequence of data packets to its destination using only the harvested energy. Each data packet is encoded with finite-length codewords, characterizing the nature of short codeword transmissions in random access networks. By combining tools from bulk-service Markov chains with stochastic geometry, we derive an analytical expression for the network average AoI and obtain closed-form results in two special cases, i.e., the small and large energy buffer size scenarios. Our analysis reveals the trade-off between energy accumulation time and transmission success probability. We then optimize the network average AoI by jointly adjusting the update rate and the blocklength of the data packet. Our findings indicate that the optimal update rate should be set to one in the energy-constrained regime where the energy consumption rate exceeds the energy arrival rate. This also means if the optimal blocklength of the data packet is pre-configured, an energy buffer size supporting only one transmission is sufficient.}

	abstract = {Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is a key mechanism for meeting the ever-increasing demand for emerging wireless services. DSA involves managing and assigning available spectrum resources in a way that minimizes interference and allows RF coexistence between heterogeneous devices and systems. Such co-existence mechanisms, if they are to succeed when heterogeneous RF devices managed by different entities need to operate in a given area and frequency band (licensed and/or unlicensed), require a common mechanism for expressing the boundaries of spectrum use of each device so that spectrum use deconfliction methods can be built and verified. Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs) – defined in the IEEE 1900.5.2 standard – offer a mechanism for RF devices to: (i) declare the characteristics of their intended spectrum use and their interference protection needs; and (ii) determine compatibility (non-interference) with existing devices. In this paper, we propose a novel SCM-based Spectrum Deconfliction (SD) algorithm that dynamically configures RF operational parameters (e.g., center frequency and transmission power) of a target transmitter-receiver pair aiming to minimize interference with existing devices/systems. We also propose sequential and distributed DSA methods that use the SD algorithm for assigning spectrum in large-scale networks. To evaluate the performance of our methods in terms of computation time, spectrum assignment efficiency, and overhead, we use two custom-made simulation platforms. Finally, to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our methods, we build a proof-of-concept implementation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS wireless testbed. The results reveal the advantages of using SCMs and their capabilities to conduct spectrum assignments in dynamic and congested communication environments.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) has emerged as a promising technology for enabling efficient spectrum and power sharing between active and backscattering transmissions. In this paper, we investigate the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted SR system, where the primary transmission uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the RIS transmits the secondary signal by backscattering the primary signal. The primary OFDM block and the secondary symbol have identical symbol periods but may not be perfectly synchronized, which can introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the received OFDM blocks, thereby hindering joint signal detection. To address this issue, we propose a novel pilot structure and receiver design for SR. Specifically, the RIS sent a training sequence at the beginning of the secondary transmission, enabling the receiver to detect the presence of ICI and estimate essential parameters. If ICI is detected, two effective methods for synchronization offset estimation are proposed. Then, joint signal detection is improved by properly decoupling primary and secondary signals, mitigating the impact of synchronization offsets. On the other hand, if ICI is absent, the secondary signal arrival is identified using the training sequence, and joint signal detection is directly performed without suffering ICI. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed estimation methods and show that the proposed detection methods ensure the reliable detection of both primary and secondary signals, even in the presence of ICI.}

	abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) technologies have long been studied and continue to attract attention for their potential to enhance wireless spectrum sharing and utilization. In CR ad hoc wireless networks (CRAHWNs), unlicensed secondary nodes (SNs) are equipped with CR transceivers capable of continuously scanning for unoccupied wireless channels. This scanning process is managed through channel-hopping (CH) rendezvous schemes, which assign CH sequences to SNs, enabling dynamic control of frequency-hopping patterns used by their CR transceivers. Traditional CH schemes operate under “global” labeling, where all SNs share an identical mapping between logical channels in their CH sequences and the transmission/reception frequencies utilized by their CR transceivers. However, when SNs operate with differing channel-to-frequency mappings—arising from regional variations or restricted access to a common frequency set—rendezvous attempts fail, preventing data exchange. Despite its importance, the development of CH sequences capable of supporting “autonomous” labeling, enabling SNs with diverse channel-to-frequency mappings to achieve successful rendezvous, remains unexplored. This paper introduces a novel class of asynchronous “universal-label” CH sequences designed to seamlessly adapt to both global and autonomous labeling frameworks. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed sequences achieve an optimal balance of essential properties. These advancements enable efficient spectrum sharing and utilization in CRAHWNs, even under challenging autonomous labeling scenarios.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of WiFi has made throughput efficiency a critical concern in wireless networks. While Full-Duplex (FD) technology promises to double network capacity by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception, existing FD-WiFi designs focus on the data transmission phase, leaving the fundamental inefficiencies in channel contention unaddressed. This paper presents CollFree, a novel WiFi protocol that exploits FD capabilities during both contention and data transmission phases. At its core, CollFree introduces a Slotwise Arbitration (SA) mechanism that enables each node to simultaneously transmit contention signals and sense channel status in each contention slot. This dual-mode operation significantly reduces contention time and facilitates collision- free data transmissions through a unique winner-determination process. We then develop theoretical models to analyze CollFree’s contention performance and throughput efficiency under both perfect and imperfect Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) conditions, providing guidelines for parameter optimization in practical deployments. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CollFree enhances throughput efficiency by over 20% compared to state-of-the-art FD-WiFi systems while maintaining distributed control and compatibility with current WiFi standards. These results suggest that it represents a significant step toward realizing the full potential of FD technology in next-generation WiFi networks.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) has been a promising technology in wireless communication systems. Channel models are of great importance for the development and assessment of system. With the increase of carrier frequency and MIMO size, the channel model needs to consider near-field spherical wave and spatial non-stationary characteristics, which is different from conventional far-field planar-wave-based geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). This paper focuses on comparing the channel characteristics and modeling in the far- and near-field region. In this work, we design the measurement campaign in the 6 GHz band (5.9-6.1 GHz) involving the unlicensed spectrum. The uniform planar array (UPA) is adopted from far-field to near-field, where the communication distance is decreasing from 21 m to 6 m (Rayleigh distance is about 14.8 m). Compared to the far-field, the spatial non-stationary phenomenon of channel parameters can be more clearly observed along the array in the near-field region. Then, we propose the extension channel model based on the channel modeling of 3GPP TR 38.901. The array domain is introduced to characterize the spatial non-stationarity of channel parameters (e.g., power, delay, angle). Subsequently, the channel characteristic parameters along the array are analyzed in the near-field range, and the non-stationary model related to the antenna array is established, including power, path loss, delay spread, angular spread, and Ricean K-factor. Finally, the model validation and parametrization are presented in detail with the actual indoor near-field MIMO channel measurements in the 6 GHz band, such as power, angle, and so on. The design and scheme of antenna array spacing are given under the influence of spatial non-stationary characteristics. These work will be helpful for the development and operation of MIMO technology in unlicensed spectra for wireless communication systems.}
