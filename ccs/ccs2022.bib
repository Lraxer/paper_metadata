	abstract = {"Forward-secure encryption (FS-PKE) is a key-evolving public-key paradigm that preserves the confidentiality of past encryptions in case of key exposure. Updatable public-key encryption (UPKE) is a natural relaxation of FS-PKE, introduced by Jost et al. (Eurocrypt'19), which is motivated by applications to secure messaging. In UPKE, key updates can be triggered by any sender -- via special update ciphertexts -- willing to enforce the forward secrecy of its encrypted messages. So far, the only truly efficient UPKE candidates (which rely on the random oracle idealization) only provide rather weak security guarantees against passive adversaries as they are malleable. Also, they offer no protection against malicious senders willing to hinder the decryption capability of honest users. A recent work of Dodis et al. (TCC'21) described UPKE systems in the standard model that also hedge against maliciously generated update messages in the chosen-ciphertext setting (where adversaries are equipped with a decryption oracle). While important feasibility results, their constructions lag behind random-oracle candidates in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we first provide a drastically more efficient UPKE realization in the standard model using Paillier's Composite Residuosity (DCR) assumption. In the random oracle model, we then extend our initial scheme so as to achieve chosen-ciphertext security, even in a model that accounts for maliciously generated update ciphertexts. Under the DCR and Strong RSA assumptions, we thus obtain the first practical UPKE systems that satisfy the strongest security notions put forth by Dodis et al."}

We provide a detailed estimate of parameters achieved -- we obtain a signature of size slightly above 45KB, for a core-SVP hardness of 109 bits.

A challenge is the inability to combine key pairs of KEMs, which can be resolved by certain forms of randomness-hardening for which we introduce a formal abstraction. We provide a generic recipe to turn classical Noise patterns into PQNoise patterns. We prove that the resulting PQNoise patterns achieve confidentiality and authenticity in the fACCE model. Moreover we show that for those classical Noise-patterns that have been conjectured or proven secure in the fACCE model our matching PQNoise patterns eventually achieve the same security. Our security proof is generic and applies to any valid PQNoise pattern. This is made possible by another abstraction, called a hash-object, which hides the exact workings of how keying material is processed in an abstract stateful object that outputs pseudorandom keys under different corruption patterns. We also show that the hash chains used in Noise are a secure hash-object. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of PQNoise delivering benchmarks for several base patterns.'}

Whereas traditional ciphers have evolved to be efficient with respect to certain performance metrics, advanced cryptographic protocols call for a different focus. The so called arithmetic complexity is viewed through the number and layout of non-linear operations in the circuit implemented by the protocol. Symmetric-key algorithms that are optimized with respect to this metric are said to be algebraic ciphers. Previous work targeting ZK and MPC protocols delivered great improvement in the performance of these applications both in lab and in practical use. Interestingly, despite its apparent benefits to privacy-aware cloud computing, algebraic ciphers targeting FHE did not attract similar attention.'}

	abstract = {'Parallel computation is an important aspect of multi-party computation, not only in terms of improving efficiency, but also in terms of providing privacy for computation involving conditional branching based on private data. While applying multi-party computation in parallel over several sets of input data is straightforward if the partitioning of the input data into sets is publicly known, the problem becomes much more challenging when this partitioning is private. This setting is relevant to broad class of secure computations, in particular to secure graph and database analysis in which the underlying data (graph or database) is private. In this paper, we consider a general class of functions which can be expressed via the iterative evaluation of a binary associative operation, and propose efficient protocols for evaluating such functions in parallel over privately partitioned input data. Our protocols are optimal in terms of the required number of evaluations of the underlying binary operation (i.e.\\ N-1 evaluations for total input size N), while simultaneously achieving a round complexity which is only logarithmic in the total size of the input data (i.e.\\ O(łog N)).'}

	abstract = {'Most blockchain-based cryptocurrencies suffer from a heavily limited transaction throughput, which is a barrier to their growing adoption. Payment channel networks (PCNs) are one of the promising solutions to this problem. PCNs reduce the on-chain load of transactions and increase the throughput by processing many payments off-chain. In fact, any two users connected via a path of payment channels (i.e., joint addresses between the two channel end-points) can perform payments, and the underlying blockchain is used only when there is a dispute between users. Unfortunately, payments in PCNs can only be conducted securely along a path, which prevents the design of many interesting applications. Moreover, the most widely used implementation, the Lightning Network in Bitcoin, suffers from a collateral lock time linear in the path length, it is affected by security issues, and it relies on specific scripting features called Hash Timelock Contracts that hinders the applicability of the underlying protocol in other blockchains.'}

	abstract = {"Payment channels (PC) are a promising solution to the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies, allowing users to perform the bulk of the transactions off-chain without needing to post everything on the blockchain. Many PC proposals however, suffer from a severe limitation: Both parties need to constantly monitor the blockchain to ensure that the other party did not post an outdated transaction. If this event happens, the honest party needs to react promptly and engage in a punishment procedure. This means that prolonged absence periods (e.g., a power outage) may be exploited by malicious users. As a mitigation, the community has introduced watchtowers, a third-party monitoring the blockchain on behalf of off-line users. Unfortunately, watchtowers are either trusted, which is critical from a security perspective, or they have to lock a certain amount of coins, called collateral, for each monitored PC in order to be held accountable, which is financially infeasible for a large network. We present Sleepy Channels, the first bi-directional PC protocol without watchtowers (or any other third party) that supports an unbounded number of payments and does not require parties to be persistently online. The key idea is to confine the period in which PC updates can be validated on-chain to a short, pre-determined time window, which is when the PC parties have to be online. This behavior is incentivized by letting the parties lock a collateral in the PC, which can be adjusted depending on their mutual trust and which they get back much sooner if they are online during this time window. Our protocol is compatible with any blockchain that is capable of verifying digital signatures (e.g., Bitcoin), as shown by our proof of concept. Moreover, our experimental results show that Sleepy Channels impose a communication and computation overhead similar to state-of-the-art PC protocols while removing watchtower's collateral and fees for the monitoring service."}

	abstract = {"Threshold signatures are a crucial tool for many distributed protocols. As shown by Cachin, Kursawe, and Shoup (PODC '00), schemes with unique signatures are of particular importance, as they allow to implement distributed coin flipping very efficiently and without any timing assumptions. This makes them an ideal building block for (inherently randomized) asynchronous consensus protocols. The threshold-BLS signature of Boldyreva (PKC '03) is both unique and very compact, but unfortunately lacks a security proof against adaptive adversaries. Thus, current consensus protocols either rely on less efficient alternatives or are not adaptively secure. In this work, we revisit the security of the threshold BLS signature by showing the following results, assuming t adaptive corruptions: - We give a modular security proof that follows a two-step approach: 1) We introduce a new security notion for distributed key generation protocols (DKG). We show that it is satisfied by several protocols that previously only had a static security proof. 2) Assuming any DKG protocol with this property, we then prove unforgeability of the threshold BLS scheme. Our reductions are tight and can be used to substantiate real-world parameter choices. - To justify our use of strong assumptions such as the algebraic group model (AGM) and the hardness of one-more-discrete logarithm (OMDL), we prove an impossibility result: Even in the AGM, a strong interactive assumption is required in order to prove the scheme secure."}

	abstract = {'Membership inference (MI) attacks highlight a privacy weakness in present stochastic training methods for neural networks. It is not well understood, however, why they arise. Are they a natural consequence of imperfect generalization only? Which underlying causes should we address during training to mitigate these attacks? Towards answering such questions, we propose the first approach to explain MI attacks and their connection to generalization based on principled causal reasoning. We offer causal graphs that quantitatively explain the observed MI attack performance achieved for 6 attack variants. We refute several prior non-quantitative hypotheses that over-simplify or over-estimate the influence of underlying causes, thereby failing to capture the complex interplay between several factors. Our causal models also show a new connection between generalization and MI attacks via their shared causal factors. Our causal models have high predictive power (0.90), i.e., their analytical predictions match with observations in unseen experiments often, which makes analysis via them a pragmatic alternative.'}

	abstract = {"A Negative Pressure Room (NPR) is an essential requirement by the Bio-Safety Levels (BSLs) in biolabs or infectious-control hospitals to prevent deadly pathogens from being leaked from the facility. An NPR maintains a negative pressure inside with respect to the outside reference space so that microbes are contained inside of an NPR. Nowadays, differential pressure sensors (DPSs) are utilized by the Building Management Systems (BMSs) to control and monitor the negative pressure in an NPR. This paper demonstrates a non-invasive and stealthy attack on NPRs by spoofing a DPS at its resonant frequency. Our contributions are: (1) We show that DPSs used in NPRs typically have resonant frequencies in the audible range. (2) We use this finding to design malicious music to create resonance in DPSs, resulting in an overshooting in the DPS's normal pressure readings. (3) We show how the resonance in DPSs can fool the BMSs so that the NPR turns its negative pressure to a positive one, causing a potential leak of deadly microbes from NPRs. We do experiments on 8 DPSs from 5 different manufacturers to evaluate their resonant frequencies considering the sampling tube length and find resonance in 6 DPSs. We can achieve a 2.5 Pa change in negative pressure from a ~7 cm distance when a sampling tube is not present and from a ~2.5 cm distance for a 1 m sampling tube length. We also introduce an interval-time variation approach for an adversarial control over the negative pressure and show that the forged pressure can be varied within 12 - 33 Pa. Our attack is also capable of attacking multiple NPRs simultaneously. Moreover, we demonstrate our attack at a real-world NPR located in an anonymous bioresearch facility, which is FDA approved and follows CDC guidelines. We also provide countermeasures to prevent the attack."}

	abstract = {'We consider the computation of sparse, (ε, ϑ)-differentially private~(DP) histograms in the two-server model of secure multi-party computation~(MPC), which has recently gained traction in the context of privacy-preserving measurements of aggregate user data. We introduce protocols that enable two semi-honest non-colluding servers to compute histograms over the data held by multiple users, while only learning a private view of the data. Our solution achieves the same asymptotic l∞-error of O(log(1/ϑoverε) as in the central model of DP, but without relying on a trusted curator. The server communication and computation costs of our protocol are independent of the number of histogram buckets, and are linear in the number of users, while the client cost is independent of the number of users, ε, and ϑ. Its linear dependence on the number of users lets our protocol scale well, which we confirm using microbenchmarks: for a billion users, ε = 0.5, and ϑ = 10-11, the per-user cost of our protocol is only 1.08 ms of server computation and 339 bytes of communication. In contrast, a baseline protocol using garbled circuits only allows up to 106 users, where it requires 600 KB communication per user.'}

We present a set of techniques that improve performance and meet the requirements of settings with large number of servers and high rate of threshold operations. More fundamentally, our techniques enable threshold cryptographic applications to run in more challenging decentralized permissionless systems, such as contemporary blockchains. In particular, we design and implement a novel threshold solution for the recently introduced YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model. The model builds on ever changing, unpredictable committees that perform ephemeral roles in a way that evades targeting by attackers and enables virtually unlimited scalability in very large networks. Our solution allows for the maintenance of system-wide keys that can be generated, used and proactivized as needed. The specific techniques build on optimized protocols for multi-secret multi-dealer verifiable secret sharing and their adaptation to the YOSO model.'}

In order to continue to enable interest-based advertising while mitigating risks of individualized user tracking, Google proposed FLoC. The FLoC algorithm assigns users to "cohorts" that represent groups of users with similar browsing behaviors so that ads can be served to users based on their cohort. In 2022, after testing FLoC in a real world trial, Google canceled the proposal with little explanation in favor of another way to enable interest-based advertising.

	abstract = {"Modern JavaScript engines that power websites and even full applications on the Web are driven by the need for an increasingly fast and snappy user experience. These engines use several complex and potentially error-prone mechanisms to optimize their performance. Unsurprisingly, the inevitable complexity results in a huge attack surface and varioustypes of software vulnerabilities. On the defender's side, fuzz testing has proven to be an invaluable tool for uncovering different kinds of memory safety violations. Although it is difficult to test interpreters and JIT compilers in an automated way, recent proposals for input generation based on grammars or target-specific intermediate representations helped uncovering many software faults. However, subtle logic bugs and miscomputations that arise from optimization passes in JIT engines continue to elude state-of-the-art testing methods. While such flaws might seem unremarkable at first glance, they are often still exploitable in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for effectively uncovering this class of subtle bugs during fuzzing. The key idea is to take advantage of the tight coupling between a JavaScript engine's interpreter and its corresponding JIT compiler as a domain-specific and generic bug oracle, which in turn yields a highly sensitive fault detection mechanism. We have designed and implemented a prototype of the proposed approach in a tool called JIT-Picker. In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method enables us to detect subtle software faults that prior work missed. In total, we uncovered 32 bugs that were not publicly known and received a $10.000 bug bounty from Mozilla as a reward for our contributions to JIT engine security."}

	abstract = {'TLS 1.3, the newest version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, provides strong authentication and confidentiality guarantees that have been comprehensively analyzed in a variety of formal models. However, despite its controversial use of handshake meta-data encryption, the privacy guarantees of TLS 1.3 remain weak and poorly understood. For example, the protocol reveals the identity of the target server to network attackers, allowing the passive surveillance and active censorship of TLS connections. To close this gap, the IETF TLS working group is standardizing a new privacy extension called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH, previously called ESNI), but the absence of a formal privacy model makes it hard to verify that this extension works. Indeed, several early drafts of ECH were found to be vulnerable to active network attacks.'}

	abstract = {'The protection of cryptographic software implementations against power-analysis attacks is critical for applications in embedded systems. A commonly used algorithmic countermeasure against these attacks is masking, a secret-sharing scheme that splits a sensitive computation into computations on multiple random shares. In practice, the security of masking schemes relies on several assumptions that are often violated by microarchitectural side-effects of CPUs. Many past works address this problem by studying these leakage effects and building corresponding leakage models that can then be integrated into a software verification workflow. However, these models have only been derived empirically, putting in question the otherwise rigorous security statements made with verification. We solve this problem in two steps. First, we introduce a contract layer between the (CPU) hardware and the software that allows the specification of microarchitectural side-effects on masked software in an intuitive language. Second, we present a method for proving the correspondence between contracts and CPU netlists to ensure the completeness of the specified leakage models. Then, any further security proofs only need to happen between software and contract, which brings benefits such as reduced verification runtime, improved user experience, and the possibility of working with vendor-supplied contracts of CPUs whose design is not available on netlist-level due to IP restrictions. We apply our approach to the popular RISC-V IBEX core, provide a corresponding formally verified contract, and describe how this contract could be used to verify masked software implementations.'}

	abstract = {"We present a set of attacks on the OpenPGP specification and implementations of it which result in full recovery of users' private keys. The attacks exploit the lack of cryptographic binding between the different fields inside an encrypted private key packet, which include the key algorithm identifier, the cleartext public parameters, and the encrypted private parameters. This allows an attacker who can overwrite certain fields in OpenPGP key packets to perform cross-algorithm attacks, causing a user's software to, for example, misinterpret an ECC private key as being a DSA key. It also allows an attacker to replace the legitimate public parameters with adversarially chosen ones, e.g. allowing them to select the DSA group. We refer to this class of attacks as Key Overwriting (KO) attacks. We provide a detailed analysis of the vulnerability of different OpenPGP libraries to KO attacks, showing in particular that in some cases additional key validation steps performed by libraries that should prevent the attacks in fact allow variant attacks. We also assess the applicability of KO attacks in the context of specific OpenPGP-based applications that reflect different threat models. Finally, we explain how KO attacks can be completely prevented (and the need for key validation obsoleted) at the OpenPGP specification level by expanding the existing proposal of using AEAD schemes for key packet protection to have all the security-relevant public fields included as Associated Data."}

	abstract = {"Online trackers, such as advertising and analytics services, have provided users with choices to opt out of their tracking and data collection to mitigate the users' concerns about increased privacy risks. While opt-out choices of online services for the cookies placed on their own websites have been examined before, the choices provided by trackers for their third-party tracking services on publisher websites have been largely overlooked. There is no guarantee that a tracker's opt-out options would faithfully follow the statements in its privacy policy. To address this concern, we develop an automated framework, called OptOutCheck, that analyzes (in)consistencies between trackers' data practices and the opt-out choice statements in their privacy policies. We create sentence-level classifiers, which achieve ≥ 84.6% precision on previously-unseen statements, to extract the opt-out policies that state neither tracking nor data collection for opted-out users from trackers' privacy-policy documents. tOptOutCheck analyzes both tracker and publisher websites to detect opt-out buttons, perform the opt-out, and extract the data flows to the tracker servers after the user opts out. Finally, we formalize the opt-out policies and data flows to derive logical conditions to detect the inconsistencies. In a large-scale study of 2.9k popular trackers, OptOutCheck detected opt-out choices on 165 trackers and found 11 trackers who exhibited data practices inconsistent with their stated opt-out policies. Since inconsistencies are violations of the trackers' privacy policies and demonstrate data collection without user consent, they are likely to lose users' trust in the online trackers and trigger the necessity of an automatic auditing process."}

	abstract = {"Owner-centric control is a widely adopted method for easing owners' concerns over data abuses and motivating them to share their data out to gain collective knowledge. However, while many control enforcement techniques have been proposed, privacy threats due to the metadata leakage therein are largely neglected in existing works. Unfortunately, a sophisticated attacker can infer very sensitive information based on either owners' data control policies or their analytic task participation histories (e.g., participating in a mental illness or cancer study can reveal their health conditions). To address this problem, we introduce Vizard, a metadata-hiding analytic system that enables privacy-hardened and enforceable control for owners. Vizard is built with a tailored suite of lightweight cryptographic tools and designs that help us efficiently handle analytic queries over encrypted data streams coming in real-time (like heart rates). We propose extension designs to further enable advanced owner-centric controls (with AND, OR, NOT operators) and provide owners with release control to additionally regulate how the result should be protected before deliveries. We develop a prototype of Vizard that is interfaced with Apache Kafka, and the evaluation results demonstrate the practicality of Vizard for large-scale and metadata-hiding analytics over data streams."}

	abstract = {"We identify a new class of vulnerabilities in implementations of differential privacy. Specifically, they arise when computing basic statistics such as sums, thanks to discrepancies between the implemented arithmetic using finite data types (namely, ints or floats) and idealized arithmetic over the reals or integers. These discrepancies cause the sensitivity of the implemented statistics (i.e., how much one individual's data can affect the result) to be much larger than the sensitivity we expect. Consequently, essentially all differential privacy libraries fail to introduce enough noise to hide individual-level information as required by differential privacy, and we show that this may be exploited in realistic attacks on differentially private query systems. In addition to presenting these vulnerabilities, we also provide a number of solutions, which modify or constrain the way in which the sum is implemented in order to recover the idealized or near-idealized bounds on sensitivity."}

	abstract = {'Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) has become the main category of embedded systems. It is widely used to support tasks requiring real-time response such as printers and switches. The security of RTOS has been long overlooked as it was running in special environments isolated from attackers. However, with the rapid development of IoT devices, tremendous RTOS devices are connected to the public network. Due to the lack of security mechanisms, these devices are extremely vulnerable to a wide spectrum of attacks. Even worse, the monolithic design of RTOS combines various tasks and services into a single binary, which hinders the current program testing and analysis techniques working on RTOS. In this paper, we propose SFuzz, a novel slice-based fuzzer, to detect security vulnerabilities in RTOS. Our insight is that RTOS usually divides a complicated binary into many separated but single-minded tasks. Each task accomplishes a particular event in a deterministic way and its control flow is usually straightforward and independent. Therefore, we identify such code from the monolithic RTOS binary and synthesize a slice for effective testing. Specifically, SFuzz first identifies functions that handle user input, constructs call graphs that start from callers of these functions, and leverages forward slicing to build the execution tree based on the call graphs and pruning the paths independent of external inputs. Then, it detects and handles roadblocks within the coarse-grain scope that hinder effective fuzzing, such as instructions unrelated to the user input. And then, it conducts coverage-guided fuzzing on these code snippets. Finally, SFuzz leverages forward and backward slicing to track and verify each path constraint and determine whether a bug discovered in the fuzzer is a real vulnerability. SFuzz successfully discovered 77 zero-day bugs on 35 RTOS samples, and 67 of them have been assigned CVE or CNVD IDs. Our empirical evaluation shows that SFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art tools (e.g., UnicornAFL) on testing RTOS.'}

	abstract = {'Machine unlearning is a process of removing the impact of some training data from the machine learning (ML) models upon receiving removal requests. While straightforward and legitimate, retraining the ML model from scratch incurs a high computational overhead. To address this issue, a number of approximate algorithms have been proposed in the domain of image and text data, among which SISA is the state-of-the-art solution. It randomly partitions the training set into multiple shards and trains a constituent model for each shard. However, directly applying SISA to the graph data can severely damage the graph structural information, and thereby the resulting ML model utility. In this paper, we propose GraphEraser, a novel machine unlearning framework tailored to graph data. Its contributions include two novel graph partition algorithms and a learning-based aggregation method. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world graph datasets to illustrate the unlearning efficiency and model utility of GraphEraser. It achieves 2.06x (small dataset) to 35.94x (large dataset) unlearning time improvement. On the other hand, GraphEraser achieves up to 62.5% higher F1 score and our proposed learning-based aggregation method achieves up to 112% higher F1 score. https://github.com/MinChen00/Graph-Unlearning.'}

	abstract = {'Machine learning as a service scenario typically requires the client to trust the server and provide sensitive data in plaintext. However, with the recent improvements in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, many such applications can be designed in a privacy-preserving way. In this work, we focus on such a problem, private decision tree evaluation (PDTE) --- where a server has a decision tree classification model, and a client wants to use the model to classify her private data without revealing the data or the classification result to the server. We present an efficient non-interactive design of PDTE, that we call SortingHat, based on FHE techniques. As part of our design, we solve multiple cryptographic problems related to FHE: (1) we propose a fast homomorphic comparison function where one input can be in plaintext format; (2) we design an efficient binary decision tree evaluation technique in the FHE setting, which we call homomorphic traversal, and apply it together with our homomorphic comparison to evaluate private decision tree classifiers, obtaining running times orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art; (3) we improve both the communication cost and the time complexity of transciphering, by applying our homomorphic comparison to the FiLIP stream cipher. Through a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that our improved transciphering solution runs around 400 times faster than previous works. We finally present a choice in terms of PDTE design: we present a version of SortingHat without transciphering that achieves significant improvement in terms of computation cost compared to prior works, and another version t-SortingHat with transciphering that has a communication cost about 20 thousand times smaller but comparable running time.'}

	abstract = {"Self-supervised learning is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm. Compared to supervised learning which leverages high-quality labeled datasets, self-supervised learning relies on unlabeled datasets to pre-train powerful encoders which can then be treated as feature extractors for various downstream tasks. The huge amount of data and computational resources consumption makes the encoders themselves become the valuable intellectual property of the model owner. Recent research has shown that the ML model's copyright is threatened by model stealing attacks, which aim to train a surrogate model to mimic the behavior of a given model. We empirically show that pre-trained encoders are highly vulnerable to model stealing attacks. However, most of the current efforts of copyright protection algorithms such as watermarking concentrate on classifiers. Meanwhile, the intrinsic challenges of pre-trained encoder's copyright protection remain largely unstudied. We fill the gap by proposing SSLGuard, the first watermarking scheme for pre-trained encoders. Given a clean pre-trained encoder, SSLGuard injects a watermark into it and outputs a watermarked version. The shadow training technique is also applied to preserve the watermark under potential model stealing attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that SSLGuard is effective in watermark injection and verification, and it is robust against model stealing and other watermark removal attacks such as input noising, output perturbing, overwriting, model pruning, and fine-tuning."}

Evaluating the privacy provided by QBSes must thus be done by evaluating the accuracy of a wide range of privacy attacks. However, existing attacks against QBSes require time and expertise to develop, need to be manually tailored to the specific systems attacked, and are limited in scope. In this paper, we develop QuerySnout, the first method to automatically discover vulnerabilities in query-based systems. QuerySnout takes as input a target record and the QBS as a black box, analyzes its behavior on one or more datasets, and outputs a multiset of queries together with a rule to combine answers to them in order to reveal the sensitive attribute of the target record. QuerySnout uses evolutionary search techniques based on a novel mutation operator to find a multiset of queries susceptible to lead to an attack, and a machine learning classifier to infer the sensitive attribute from answers to the queries selected. We showcase the versatility of QuerySnout by applying it to two attack scenarios (assuming access to either the private dataset or to a different dataset from the same distribution), three real-world datasets, and a variety of protection mechanisms. We show the attacks found by QuerySnout to consistently equate or outperform, sometimes by a large margin, the best attacks from the literature. We finally show how QuerySnout can be extended to QBSes that require a budget, and apply QuerySnout to a simple QBS based on the Laplace mechanism. Taken together, our results show how powerful and accurate attacks against QBSes can already be found by an automated system, allowing for highly complex QBSes to be automatically tested "at the pressing of a button". We believe this line of research to be crucial to improve the robustness of systems providing privacy-preserving access to personal data in theory and in practice.'}

Without sharding, every node in the network has to listen to and process all ledger protocol messages. The basic idea of sharding is to parallelize the ledger protocol: the nodes are divided into smaller subsets that each take care of a fraction of the original load by executing lighter instances of the ledger protocol, also called shards. The smaller the shards, the higher the efficiency, as by increasing parallelism there is less overhead in the shard consensus.'}

	abstract = {"Current research in the automotive domain has proven the limitations of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol from a security standpoint. Application-layer attacks, which involve the creation of malicious packets, are deemed feasible from remote but can be easily detected by modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). On the other hand, more recent link-layer attacks are stealthier and possibly more disruptive but require physical access to the bus. In this paper, we present CANflict, a software-only approach that allows reliable manipulation of the CAN bus at the data link layer from an unmodified microcontroller, overcoming the limitations of state-of-the-art works. We demonstrate that it is possible to deploy stealthy CAN link-layer attacks from a remotely compromised ECU, targeting another ECU on the same CAN network. To do this, we exploit the presence of pin conflicts between microcontroller peripherals to craft polyglot frames, which allows an attacker to control the CAN traffic at the bit level and bypass the protocol's rules. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-, mid-, and low-end microcontrollers, and we provide the ground for future research by releasing an extensible tool that can be used to implement our approach on different platforms and to build CAN countermeasures at the data link layer."}

	abstract = {"In this paper, we extend Inner-Product Functional Encryption (IPFE), where there is just a vector in the key and a vector in the single sender's ciphertext, to two-client ciphertexts. More precisely, in our two-client functional encryption scheme, there are two Data Providers who can independently encrypt vectors x and y for a data consumer who can, from a functional decryption key associated to a vector α, compute ∑αi xiyi = x ⋅ Diag(α) ⋅ yT. Ciphertexts are linear in the dimension of the vectors, whereas the functional decryption keys are of constant size. We study two interesting particular cases:2-party Inner-Product Functional Encryption, with α = (1,…,1). There is a unique functional decryption key, which enables the computation of x ⋅ xT by a third party, where x and y are provided by two independent clients;Inner-Product Functional Encryption with a Selector, with x = x0 II x1 and y = bn II bn ∈{1n || 0n, 0n II 1n}, for some bit b, on the public coefficients α = α0 II α1, in the functional decryption key, so that one gets xb ⋅ αbT, where x and b are provided by two independent clients.This result is based on the fundamental Product-Preserving Lemma, which is of independent interest. It exploits Dual Pairing Vector Spaces (DPVS), with security proofs under the SXDH assumption. We provide two practical applications to medical diagnosis for the latter IPFE with a selector, and to money-laundering detection for the former 2-party IPFE, both with strong privacy properties, adaptative security and the use of labels granting a Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) security for the scheme, thus enabling its use in practical situations."}

	abstract = {'Speaker Recognition Systems (SRSs) grant access to legitimate users based on voiceprint. Recent research has shown that SRSs can be bypassed during the training phase (backdoor attacks) and the recognition phase (evasion attacks). In this paper, we explore a new attack surface of SRSs by presenting an enrollment-phase attack paradigm, named FenceSitter, where the adversary poisons the SRS using imperceptible adversarial ambient sound when the legitimate user registers into the SRS. The tainted voiceprint extracted by the SRS allows both the adversary and the legitimate user to access the system in all future recognition phases. To materialize such attack, we interleave carefully-designed continuous adversarial perturbations into innocent-sounding ambient sound. As computing adversarial perturbations over a long sequence of ambient sound carrier is intractable, we optimize over adversarial segments with content desensitization and physical realization. In addition, the attack is made available under the black-box settings by gradient estimation based on the natural evolution strategy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both English and Chinese voice datasets for close-set identification (CSI), open-set identification (OSI), and speaker verification (SV) tasks. The results under various digital and physical conditions have verified the effectiveness and robustness of FenceSitter. With live enrollment experiments and user study, we further validate the practicality of FenceSitter. Our work reveals the vulnerability of SRSs during the enrollment phase, which may spur future research in improving the security of SRSs.'}

However, in spite of these important use cases, Arm GPU security has yet to be scrutinized by the community. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the kernel, attackers can directly access sensitive data used during GPU computing, such as personally-identifiable image data in computer vision tasks. Existing work has used Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to address GPU security concerns on Intel-based platforms, while there are numerous architectural differences that lead to novel technical challenges in deploying TEEs for Arm GPUs. In addition, extant Arm-based GPU defenses are intended for secure machine learning, and lack generality. There is a need for generalizable and efficient Arm-based GPU security mechanisms.'}

	abstract = {"Famous for its superior performance, deep learning (DL) has been popularly used within many applications, which also at the same time attracts various threats to the models. One primary threat is from adversarial attacks. Researchers have intensively studied this threat for several years and proposed dozens of approaches to create adversarial examples (AEs). But most of the approaches are only evaluated on limited models and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). Thus, the effectiveness of attacking real-world DL models is not quite clear. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of adversarial attacks on real-world DNN models and provide a real-world model dataset named RWM. Particularly, we design a suite of approaches to adapt current AE generation algorithms to the diverse real-world DL models, including automatically extracting DL models from Android apps, capturing the inputs and outputs of the DL models in apps, generating AEs and validating them by observing the apps' execution. For black-box DL models, we design a semantic-based approach to build suitable datasets and use them for training substitute models when performing transfer-based attacks. After analyzing 245 DL models collected from 62,583 real-world apps, we have a unique opportunity to understand the gap between real-world DL models and contemporary AE generation algorithms. To our surprise, the current AE generation algorithms can only directly attack 6.53% of the models. Benefiting from our approach, the success rate upgrades to 47.35%."}

	abstract = {"Fitness tracking social networks such as Strava allow users to record sports activities and share them publicly. Sharing encourages peer interaction but also constitutes a risk, because an activity's start or finish may inadvertently reveal privacy-sensitive locations such as a home or workplace. To mitigate this risk, networks introduced endpoint privacy zones (EPZs), which hide track portions around protected locations. In this paper, we show that EPZ implementations of major services remain vulnerable to inference attacks that significantly reduce the effective anonymity provided by the EPZ, and even reveal the protected location. Our attack leverages distance information leaked in activity metadata, street grid data, and the locations of the entry points into the EPZ. This yields a constrained search space where we use regression analysis to predict protected locations. Our evaluation on 1.4 million Strava activities shows that our attack discovers the protected location for up to 85% of EPZs. Larger EPZs reduce the performance of our attack, while geographically dispersed activities in sparser street grids yield better performance. We propose six countermeasures, that, however, come with a usability trade-off, and responsibly disclosed our findings and countermeasures to the major networks."}

	abstract = {'In this paper, we introduce a second-order masking of the AES using the minimal number of shares and a total of 1268 bits of randomness including the sharing of the plaintext and key. The masking of the S-box is based on the tower field decomposition of the inversion over bytes where the changing of the guards technique is used in order to re-mask the middle branch of the decomposition. The sharing of the S-box is carefully crafted such that it achieves first-order probing security without the use of randomness and such that the sharing of its output is uniform. Multi-round security is achieved by re-masking the state where we use a theoretical analysis based on the propagation of probed information to reduce the demand for fresh randomness per round. The result is a second-order masked AES which competes with the state-of-the-art in terms of latency and area, but reduces the randomness complexity over eight times over the previous known works. In addition to the corresponding theoretical analysis and proofs for the security of our masked design, it has been implemented on FPGA and evaluated via lab analysis.'}

In recent years, and with the advent of micro-architectural or hardware-oriented attacks, it became more and more clear that similar attack vectors can also be exploited on larger computing platforms and without the requirement of physical proximity of an attacker. While newly discovered attacks typically come with implementation recommendations that help counteract a specific attack vector, the process of constantly patching cryptographic code is quite time consuming in some cases, and simply not possible in other cases.'}

Since Tor provides server and client anonymity, hundreds of malware binaries found in the wild rely on it to hide their presence and hinder Command & Control (C&C) takedown operations. We believe Tor is a paramount tool enabling online freedom and privacy, and blocking it to defend against such malware is infeasible for both users and organizations. In this work, we present effective traffic analysis approaches that can accurately identify Tor-based malware communication. We collect hundreds of Tor-based malware binaries, execute and examine more than 47,000 active encrypted malware connections and compare them with benign browsing traffic. In addition to traditional traffic analysis features (which work at the connection level), we propose global host-level network features to capture peculiar malware communication fingerprints across host logs. Our experiments confirm that our models are able to detect "zero-day\'\' malware connections with 0.7% FPR even when malware connections constitute less than 5% of Tor traces in the test set. Using multi-labeling approaches, we are able to accurately detect the malware behavior-based classes (grayware, ransomware, etc). Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our models on real-world enterprise logs and show that the classifiers can identify infected hosts even with missing features.'}

	abstract = {"Currently, in Android, applications (apps for short) rely heavily on external storage to provide their services. Race conditions are introduced by the inappropriate file operations. Through race conditions, the malicious app can manipulate the file content and induce the victim app to perform unexpected actions, which we callrace condition attack. Race condition attack can cause a series of security problems and prior work has already implemented some of them. From Android 10, Google has introduced scoped storage to defend against attacks based on external storage. However, considering current market shares of different Android versions, it is still a long way to have scoped storage deployed on each device. To protect current users from this kind of attack, it is essential to raise app developers' security awareness. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive survey on race condition attack to learn about its current status over Android apps. We propose an analysis engine, named RECAST, which gathers file operation events on external storage and infers the associated file operation processes. With RECAST, we collect 5,359,339 file operation events over 105,963 files. From the analysis result, we find that, with the limited kinds of events, a tremendous number of unique file operating patterns (1,977) are constituted. Over these file operating patterns, the time window is much common and available to launch a series of attacks (94.26% of the tested files are vulnerable to this problem). Consequently, race condition attack has become a non-negligible issue for app developers when using Android external storage."}

	abstract = {"Previous adversarial audio attacks have mainly focused on ensuring the effectiveness of attacking an audio signal classifier via creating a small noise-like perturbation on the original signal. It is still unclear if an attacker is able to create audio signal perturbations that can be well perceived by human beings in addition to its attack effectiveness. In this work, we formulate the adversarial attack against music signals as a new perception-aware attack framework, which integrates human study into adversarial attack design. Specifically, we invite human participants to rate their perceived deviation based on pairs of original and perturbed music signals, and reverse-engineer the human perception process by regression analysis to predict the human-perceived deviation given a perturbed signal. The perception-aware attack is then formulated as an optimization problem that finds an optimal perturbation signal to minimize the prediction of perceived deviation from the regressed human perception model. Experiments show that the attack produces adversarial music with significantly better perceptual quality than prior work against YouTube's copyright detector."}

A number of prominent inconsistency detection approaches have been proposed in and across various layers of the Android operating system. However, the existing approaches suffer from high false positive rates as they rely solely on simplistic convergence analysis and reachability based relations to reason about the validity of access control enforcement. We observe that resource-to-access control associations are highly uncertain in the context of Android. Thus, we introduce Poirot, a next-generation inconsistency detection tool that leverages probabilistic inference to generate a comprehensive set of protection recommendations for Android framework APIs. We evaluate Poirot on four Android images and detect 26 total inconsistencies.'}

The online phase of our protocol requires 12 elements in total per multiplication gate with circuit-dependent preprocessing, or 20 elements in total with circuit-independent preprocessing. Prior works achieved linear online communication complexity in n, the number of parties, with the best prior existing solution involving 1.5n elements per multiplication gate. Only one recent work packing [28] achieves constant online communication complexity, but the constants are large (108 elements for passive security, and twice that for active security). That said, our protocol offers a very efficient information theoretic online phase for any number of parties.'}

We propose a general technique, NFGen1, that utilizes pre-computed discrete piecewise polynomials to accurately approximate generic functions using fixed-point numbers. We implement it using a performance-prediction-based code generator to support different platforms. Conducting extensive evaluations of 23 non-linear functions against six MPC protocols on two platforms, we demonstrate significant performance, accuracy, and generality improvements over existing methods.'}

Thus, user differential privacy (user-DP) has recently gained more attention, which includes node-DP for graph data as a special case. Most existing work on user-DP has only studied the sum estimation problem. In this work, we design a general DP mechanism for any monotonic function under user-DP with strong optimality guarantees. While our general mechanism may run in super-polynomial time, we show how to instantiate an approximate version in polynomial time on some common monotonic functions, including sum, k-selection, maximum frequency, and distinct count. Finally, we conduct experiments on all these functions and the results show that our framework is more general and obtains better results in many cases.'}

While countermeasures against passive side-channel and active fault-injection attacks are well understood individually, combined attacks, i.e., the combination of fault injection and side-channel analysis, is a mostly unexplored area. Naturally, the complexity of analysis and secure construction increases with the sophistication of the adversary, making the combined scenario especially challenging. To tackle complexity, the side-channel community has converged on the construction of small building blocks, which maintain security properties even when composed. In this regard, Probe-Isolating Non-Interference (PINI) is a widely used notion for secure composition in the presence of side-channel attacks due to its efficiency and elegance. In this work, we transfer the core ideas behind PINI to the context of fault and combined security and, from that, construct the first trivially composable gadgets in the presence of a combined adversary.'}

A multi-signature scheme allows multiple signatures for the same message but from independent signers to be compressed into one short aggregated signature, which allows verifying all of the signatures simultaneously. In the synchronized setting, the signing algorithm takes the current time step as an additional input. It is assumed that no signer signs more than one message per time step and we aim to aggregate signatures for the same message and same time step. This setting is particularly useful in the context of blockchains, where validators are naturally synchronized by the blocks they sign.'}

	abstract = {"Every day, we have to decide multiple times, whether and how much personal data we allow to be collected. This decision is not trivial, since there are many legitimate and important purposes for data collection, for examples, the analysis of mobility data to improve urban traffic and transportation. However, often the collected data can reveal sensitive information about individuals. Recently visited locations can, for example, reveal information about political or religious views or even about an individual's health. Privacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), can be employed to protect the privacy of individuals and, furthermore, provide mathematically sound guarantees on the maximum privacy risk. However, they can only support informed privacy decisions, if individuals understand the provided privacy guarantees. This article proposes a novel approach for communicating privacy guarantees to support individuals in their privacy decisions when sharing data. For this, we adopt risk communication formats from the medical domain in conjunction with a model for privacy guarantees of DP to create quantitative privacy risk notifications."}

Our study aimed to understand why developers introduce different vulnerabilities, the ways they evaluate programs for vulnerabilities, and why different vulnerabilities are (not) found and (not) fixed. We used iterative open coding to systematically analyze contest data including code, commit messages, and team design documents. Our results point to the importance of existing best practices for secure development, the use of security tools, and development team organization."}

	abstract = {"Neural networks have become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, understanding their decision process turns out to be complicated. One vital method to explain a models' behavior is feature attribution, i.e., attributing its decision to pivotal features. Although many algorithms are proposed, most of them aim to improve the faithfulness (fidelity) to the model. However, the real environment contains many random noises, which may cause the feature attribution maps to be greatly perturbed for similar images. More seriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, generating the same explanation for a maliciously perturbed input. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real scenarios, especially in security-critical applications."}

Traditionally, auctions need the presence of a trusted auctioneer to whom the bidders provide their private bid values. Existence of such a trusted party is not an assumption easily realized in practice. Generic secure computation protocols can be used to remove a trusted party.

	abstract = {'We study the problem of constructing succinct zero knowledge proof systems for floating point computations. The standard approach to handle floating point computations requires conversion to binary circuits, following the IEEE-754 floating point standard. This approach incurs a poly(w) overhead in prover efficiency for computations with w-bit precision, resulting in very high prover runtimes -- already the key bottleneck in the design of succinct arguments. We make the following contributions: -We propose a new model for verifying floating point computations that guarantees approximate correctness w.r.t. a relative error bound. This model is inspired by numerical analysis, and is very meaningful for applications such as machine learning and scientific computing. -Using this model, we present a general method for constructing succinct zero-knowledge proofs for floating point computations starting from existing public-coin "commit-and-prove\'\' systems. For computations with w-bit precision, our approach incurs only a log(w) overhead in prover running time. Our compiler nearly preserves (up to a factor of 2) the communication complexity of the underlying protocol, and requires sub-linear verification time. The resulting proof can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model. Concretely, our scheme is ~57x faster than the method following IEEE standard exactly [35] for 32-bit floating point computations. Central to our main result, and of independent interest, is a new batch range proof system in standard prime order groups that does not rely on bit decomposition.'}

Although researchers have proposed many techniques to detect HTs, several critical limitations exist, including: (i) a low success rate of HT detection, (ii) high algorithmic complexity, and (iii) a large number of test patterns. Furthermore, as we show in this work the most pertinent drawback of prior (including state-of-the-art) detection techniques stems from an incorrect evaluation methodology, i.e., they assume that an adversary inserts HTs randomly. Such inappropriate adversarial assumptions enable detection techniques to claim high HT detection accuracy, leading to a "false sense of security."

Given seed addresses belonging to a cybercrime campaign, it outputs a transaction graph, and identifies paths corresponding to relationships between the campaign under study and external services and other cybercrime campaigns. Back-and-forth exploration provides two key contributions. First, it explores both forward and backwards, instead of only forward as done by prior work, enabling the discovery of relationships that cannot be found by only exploring forward (e.g., deposits from clients of a mixer). Second, it prevents graph explosion by combining a tagging database with a machine learning classifier for identifying addresses belonging to exchanges.'}

	abstract = {'Certificate authorities in public key infrastructures typically require entities to prove possession of the secret key corresponding to the public key they want certified. While this is straightforward for digital signature schemes, the most efficient solution for public key encryption and key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) requires an interactive challenge-response protocol, requiring a departure from current issuance processes. In this work we investigate how to non-interactively prove possession of a KEM secret key, specifically for lattice-based KEMs, motivated by the recently proposed KEMTLS protocol which replaces signature-based authentication in TLS 1.3 with KEM-based authentication. Although there are various zero-knowledge (ZK) techniques that can be used to prove possession of a lattice key, they yield large proofs or are inefficient to generate. We propose a technique called verifiable generation, in which a proof of possession is generated at the same time as the key itself is generated. Our technique is inspired by the Picnic signature scheme and uses the multi-party-computation-in-the-head (MPCitH) paradigm; this similarity to a signature scheme allows us to bind attribute data to the proof of possession, as required by certificate issuance protocols. We show how to instantiate this approach for two lattice-based KEMs in Round 3 of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization project, Kyber and FrodoKEM, and achieve reasonable proof sizes and performance. Our proofs of possession are faster and an order of magnitude smaller than the previous best MPCitH technique for knowledge of a lattice key, and in size-optimized cases can be comparable to even state-of-the-art direct lattice-based ZK proofs for Kyber. Our approach relies on a new result showing the uniqueness of Kyber and FrodoKEM secret keys, even if the requirement that all secret key components are small is partially relaxed, which may be of independent interest for improving efficiency of zero-knowledge proofs for other lattice-based statements.'}

	abstract = {"In this paper, we propose SpecPatch, a human-in-the loop adversarial audio attack on automated speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing audio adversarial attacker assumes that the users cannot notice the adversarial audios, and hence allows the successful delivery of the crafted adversarial examples or perturbations. However, in a practical attack scenario, the users of intelligent voice-controlled systems (e.g., smartwatches, smart speakers, smartphones) have constant vigilance for suspicious voice, especially when they are delivering their voice commands. Once the user is alerted by a suspicious audio, they intend to correct the falsely-recognized commands by interrupting the adversarial audios and giving more powerful voice commands to overshadow the malicious voice. This makes the existing attacks ineffective in the typical scenario when the user's interaction and the delivery of adversarial audio coincide. To truly enable the imperceptible and robust adversarial attack and handle the possible arrival of user interruption, we design SpecPatch, a practical voice attack that uses a sub-second audio patch signal to deliver an attack command and utilize periodical noises to break down the communication between the user and ASR systems. We analyze the CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss forwarding and backwarding process and exploit the weakness of CTC to achieve our attack goal. Compared with the existing attacks, we extend the attack impact length (i.e., the length of attack target command) by 287%. Furthermore, we show that our attack achieves 100% success rate in both over-the-line and over-the-air scenarios amid user intervention."}

	abstract = {"Targeted training-set attacks inject malicious instances into the training set to cause a trained model to mislabel one or more specific test instances. This work proposes the task of target identification, which determines whether a specific test instance is the target of a training-set attack. Target identification can be combined with adversarial-instance identification to find (and remove) the attack instances, mitigating the attack with minimal impact on other predictions. Rather than focusing on a single attack method or data modality, we build on influence estimation, which quantifies each training instance's contribution to a model's prediction. We show that existing influence estimators' poor practical performance often derives from their over-reliance on training instances and iterations with large losses. Our renormalized influence estimators fix this weakness; they far outperform the original estimators at identifying influential groups of training examples in both adversarial and non-adversarial settings, even finding up to 100% of adversarial training instances with no clean-data false positives. Target identification then simplifies to detecting test instances with anomalous influence values. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on backdoor and poisoning attacks across various data domains, including text, vision, and speech, as well as against a gray-box, adaptive attacker that specifically optimizes the adversarial instances to evade our method.

	abstract = {'Location spoofing attack deceiving a Wi-Fi positioning system has been studied for over a decade. However, it has been challenging to construct a practical spoofing attack in urban areas with dense coverage of legitimate Wi-Fi APs. This paper identifies the vulnerability of the Google Geolocation API, which returns the location of a mobile device based on the information of the Wi-Fi access points that the device can detect. We show that this vulnerability can be exploited by the attacker to reveal the black-box localization algorithms adopted by the Google Wi-Fi positioning system and easily launch the location spoofing attack in dense urban areas with a high success rate. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also lead to severe consequences that hurt user privacy, including the leakage of sensitive information like precise locations, daily activities, and demographics. Ultimately, we discuss the potential countermeasures that may be used to mitigate this vulnerability and location spoofing attack.'}

In this paper, we fill this gap and systematically measure the privacy risks of NAS architectures. Leveraging the insights from our measurement study, we further explore the cell patterns of cell-based NAS architectures and evaluate how the cell patterns affect the privacy risks of NAS-searched architectures. Through extensive experiments, we shed light on how to design robust NAS architectures against privacy attacks, and also offer a general methodology to understand the hidden correlation between the NAS-searched architectures and other privacy risks.'}

	abstract = {'Key-value data is a naturally occurring data type that has not been thoroughly investigated in the local trust model. Existing local differentially private (LDP) solutions for computing statistics over key-value data suffer from the inherent accuracy limitations of each user adding their own noise. Multi-party computation (MPC) maintains better accuracy than LDP and similarly does not require a trusted central party. However, naively applying MPC to key-value data results in prohibitively expensive computation costs. In this work, we present selective multi-party computation, a novel approach to distributed computation that leverages DP leakage to efficiently and accurately compute statistics over key-value data. By providing each party with a view of a random subset of the data, we can capture subtractive noise. We prove that our protocol satisfies pure DP and is provably secure in the combined DP/MPC model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that we can compute statistics over 10,000 keys in 20 seconds and can scale up to 30 servers while obtaining results for a single key in under a second.'}

	abstract = {'This study derives information-theoretical bounds of the success rate (SR) of side-channel attacks on masked implementations. We first develop a communication channel model representing side-channel attacks on masked implementations. We then derive two SR bounds based on the conditional probability distribution and mutual information of shares. The basic idea is to evaluate the upper-bound of the mutual information between the non-masked secret value and the side-channel trace by the conditional probability distribution of shares given its leakage, with a help of the Walsh-Hadamard transform. With the derived theorems, we also prove the security of masking schemes: the SR decreases exponentially with an increase in the number of masking shares, under a much more relaxed condition than the previous proof. To validate and utilize our theorems in practice, we propose a deep-learning-based profiling method for approximating the conditional probability distribution of shares to estimate the SR bound and the number of traces required for attacking a given device. We experimentally confirm that our bounds are much stronger than the conventional bounds on masked implementations, which validates the relevance of our theorems to practice.'}

	abstract = {'Several recent research efforts have proposed Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions that can detect complex patterns in network traffic for a wide range of network security problems. However, without understanding how these black-box models are making their decisions, network operators are reluctant to trust and deploy them in their production settings. One key reason for this reluctance is that these models are prone to the problem of underspecification, defined here as the failure to specify a model in adequate detail. Not unique to the network security domain, this problem manifests itself in ML models that exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior when deployed in real-world settings and has prompted growing interest in developing interpretable ML solutions (e.g., decision trees) for "explaining\'\' to humans how a given black-box model makes its decisions. However, synthesizing such explainable models that capture a given black-box model\'s decisions with high fidelity while also being practical (i.e., small enough in size for humans to comprehend) is challenging.'}

Users sign in at a trusted Identity Provider (IdP) that subsequently allows many Service Providers (SPs) to verify the users' identities. Previous research concentrated on the standardized - called textbook SSO in this paper - authentication flows, which rely on HTTP redirects to transfer identity tokens between the SP and IdP. However, modern web applications like single page apps may not be able to execute the textbook flow because they lose the local state in case of HTTP redirects. By using novel browser technologies, such as postMessage, developers designed and implemented SSO protocols that were neither documented nor analyzed thoroughly. We call them dual-window SSO flows."}

	abstract = {"Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown values of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant of attribute inference we call sensitive value inference, where the adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model, but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3) white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/bargavj/EvaluatingDPML."}

	abstract = {'Cache side-channel attacks exhibit severe threats to software security and privacy, especially for cryptosystems. In this paper, we propose CaType, a novel refinement type-based tool for detecting cache side channels in crypto software. Compared to previous works, CaType provides the following advantages: (1) For the first time CaType analyzes cache side channels using refinement type over x86 assembly code. It reveals several significant and effective enhancements with refined types, including bit-level granularity tracking, distinguishing different effects of variables, precise type inferences, and high scalability. (2) CaType is the first static analyzer for crypto libraries in consideration of blinding-based defenses. (3) From the perspective of implementation, CaType uses cache layouts of potential vulnerable control-flow branches rather than cache states to suppress false positives. We evaluate CaType in identifying side channel vulnerabilities in real-world crypto software, including RSA, ElGamal, and (EC)DSA from OpenSSL and Libgcrypt. CaType captures all known defects, detects previously-unknown vulnerabilities, and reveals several false positives of previous tools. In terms of performance, CaType is 16X faster than CacheD and 131X faster than CacheS when analyzing the same libraries. These evaluation results confirm the capability of CaType in identifying side channel defects with great precision, efficiency, and scalability.'}

Unfortunately, understanding a bug's capabilities is a time consuming process, requiring (a) an understanding of the bug's root cause, (b) an understanding how an attacker may exploit the bug, and (c) the development of a patch mitigating these threats.

	abstract = {'Consumer IoT products and services are ubiquitous; yet, a proper characterization of consumer IoT security is infeasible without an understanding of what IoT products are on the market, i.e., without a market-scale perspective. This paper seeks to close this gap by developing the IoTSpotter framework, which automatically constructs a market-scale snapshot of mobile-IoT apps, i.e., mobile apps that are used as companions or automation providers to IoT devices. IoTSpotter also extracts artifacts that allow us to examine the security of this snapshot in the IoT context (e.g., devices supported by apps, IoT-specific libraries). Using IoTSpotter, we identify 37,783 mobile-IoT apps from Google Play, the largest set of mobile-IoT apps so far, and uncover 7 key results in the process (ℛ1-ℛ7). We leverage this dataset to perform three key security analyses that lead to 10 impactful security findings (F1-F10) that demonstrate the current state of mobile-IoT apps. Our analysis uncovers severe cryptographic violations in 94.11% (863/917) mobile-IoT apps with >1 million installs each, 65 vulnerable IoT-specific libraries affected by 79 unique CVEs, and used by 40 popular apps, and 7,887 apps that is affected by the Janus vulnerability. Finally, a case study with 18 popular mobile-IoT apps uncovers the critical impact of the vulnerabilities in them on important IoT artifacts and functions, motivating the development of mobile security analysis contextualized to IoT.'}

	abstract = {'Predicting function names in stripped binaries is an extremely useful but challenging task, as it requires summarizing the execution behavior and semantics of the function in human languages. Recently, there has been significant progress in this direction with machine learning. However, existing approaches fail to model the exhaustive function behavior and thus suffer from the poor generalizability to unseen binaries. To advance the state of the art, we present a function Symbol name prediction and binary Language Modeling (SymLM) framework, with a novel neural architecture that learns the comprehensive function semantics by jointly modeling the execution behavior of the calling context and instructions via a novel fusing encoder. We have evaluated SymLM with 1,431,169 binary functions from 27 popular open source projects, compiled with 4 optimizations (O0-O3) for 4 different architectures (i.e., x64, x86, ARM, and MIPS) and 4 obfuscations. SymLM outperforms the state-of-the-art function name prediction tools by up to 15.4%, 59.6%, and 35.0% in precision, recall, and F1 score, with significantly better generalizability and obfuscation resistance. Ablation studies also show that our design choices (e.g., fusing components of the calling context and execution behavior) substantially boost the performance of function name prediction. Finally, our case studies further demonstrate the practical use cases of SymLM in analyzing firmware images.'}

	abstract = {"Modern IoT device manufacturers are taking advantage of the managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IoT clouds (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT) for secure and convenient IoT development/deployment. The IoT access control is achieved by manufacturer-specified, cloud-enforced IoT access policies (cloud-standard JSON documents, called IoT Policies) stating which users can access which IoT devices/resources under what constraints. In this paper, we performed a systematic study on the security of cloud-based IoT access policies on modern PaaS/IaaS IoT clouds. Our research shows that the complexity in the IoT semantics and enforcement logic of the policies leaves tremendous space for device manufacturers to program a flawed IoT access policy, introducing convoluted logic flaws which are non-trivial to reason about. In addition to challenges/mistakes in the design space, it is astonishing to find that mainstream device manufacturers also generally make critical mistakes in deploying IoT Policies thanks to the flexibility offered by PaaS/IaaS clouds and the lack of standard practices for doing so. Our assessment of 36 device manufacturers and 310 open-source IoT projects highlights the pervasiveness and seriousness of the problems, which once exploited, can have serious impacts on IoT users' security, safety, and privacy. To help manufacturers identify and easily fix IoT Policy flaws, we introduce P-Verifier, a formal verification tool that can automatically verify cloud-based IoT Policies. With evaluated high effectiveness and low performance overhead, P-Verifier will contribute to elevating security assurance in modern IoT deployments and access control. We responsibly reported all findings to affected vendors and fixes were deployed or on the way."}

	abstract = {"In-network/in-switch Access Control List (ACL) is an essential security component of modern networks. In high-speed networks, ACL rules are often placed in a switch's Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) for timely ACL match-action and management (e.g. insertion and deletion). However, TCAM-based ACL systems are encountering an scalability issue owing to increasing demand on AI-powered autonomous defenses that detect and block attacks online, which inevitably derives finer-grained ACL rules. Existing solutions minimize the TCAM usage by partially offloading ACL matching into larger Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) or customized hardware. Nevertheless, current SRAM-based solutions induce high management costs, especially a high rule-deployment latency, which delays time-sensitive defense actions. Also, the customized hardware approaches have its own scalability issue. To support autonomous defenses at a scale, in this paper, we propose an in-switch ACL system called PortCatcher, which breaks the trade-off between scalability and rule management latency. System-wise, we detach layer-4 port matching from TCAM for improving its memory efficiency. Algorithm-wise, we introduce a novel port (range) rule representation concept, called linear range map (LRM), which enables port (range) matching in SRAM-based hash tables. LRM guarantees not only fast and scalable port matching but also low-latency ACL management for timely defenses. With real-world ACL datasets, we show that PortCatcher saves 74%-90% TCAM space compared to state-of-the-art approaches by adding small overhead to SRAM (0.49 SRAM entry per ACL rule). Also, we deploy PortCatcher on a programmable switch to demonstrate that PortCatcher can serve 5-tuple rule matching at a line rate, where port rules are completely matched in SRAM. With a use case study, namely autonomous attack mitigation, we show that PortCatcher has a negligible rule management latency to block attack flows (i.e. 94.42% of rules deployed within 10 ms)."}

Recently, various analysis techniques have been proposed to find syntactically recurring vulnerabilities via code reuse. However, limited attention has been devoted to semantically recurring ones that share the same vulnerable behavior in different code structures. In this paper, we present a general analysis framework, called TRACER, for detecting such recurring vulnerabilities. TRACER is based on a taint analysis that can detect various types of vulnerabilities. For a given set of known vulnerabilities, the taint analysis extracts vulnerable traces and establishes a signature database of them. When a new unseen program is analyzed, TRACER compares all potentially vulnerable traces reported by the analysis with the known vulnerability signatures. Then, TRACER reports a list of potential vulnerabilities ranked by the similarity score. We evaluate TRACER on 273 Debian packages in C/C++. Our experiment results demonstrate that TRACER is able to find 281 previously unknown vulnerabilities with 6 CVE identifiers assigned.'}

	abstract = {'Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) aspire to offer a digital replacement for physical cash and as such need to tackle two fundamental requirements that are in conflict. On the one hand, it is desired they are private so that a financial "panopticon\'\' is avoided, while on the other, they should be regulation friendly in the sense of facilitating any threshold-limiting, tracing, and counterparty auditing functionality that is necessary to comply with regulations such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) as well as financial stability considerations. In this work, we put forth a new model for CBDCs and an efficient construction that, for the first time, fully addresses these issues simultaneously. Moreover, recognizing the importance of avoiding a single point of failure, our construction is distributed so that all its properties can withstand a suitably bounded minority of participating entities getting corrupted by an adversary. Achieving all the above properties efficiently is technically involved; among others, our construction uses suitable cryptographic tools to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks, it showcases a novel traceability mechanism with significant performance gains compared to previously known techniques and, perhaps surprisingly, shows how to obviate Byzantine agreement or broadcast from the optimistic execution path of a payment, something that results in an essentially optimal communication pattern and communication overhead when the sender and receiver are honest. Going beyond "simple\'\' payments, we also discuss how our scheme can facilitate one-off large transfers complying with Know Your Transaction (KYT) disclosure requirements. Our CBDC concept is expressed and realized in the Universal Composition (UC) framework providing in this way a modular and secure way to embed it within a larger financial ecosystem.'}

	abstract = {"Many cyberattacks start with disseminating phishing URLs. When clicking these phishing URLs, the victim's private information is leaked to the attacker. There have been proposed several machine learning methods to detect phishing URLs. However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with evasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating patterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages because making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii) prefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are cheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv) sometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade existing detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we present a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs camouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion. In the network approach, a phishing URL will be still identified as phishy even after evasion unless a majority of its neighbors in the network are evaded at the same time. Our method consistently shows better detection performance throughout various experimental tests than state-of-the-art methods, e.g., F-1 of 0.891 for our method vs. 0.840 for the best feature-based method."}

	abstract = {'Over the last years, the rise of the IoT, and the connection of mobile - and hence physically accessible - devices, immensely enhanced the demand for fast and secure hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms which offer thorough protection against SCA attacks. Among a variety of proposed countermeasures against SCA, masking has transpired to be a promising candidate, attracting significant attention in both, academia and industry. Here, abstract adversary models have been derived, aiming to accurately model real-world attack scenarios, while being sufficiently simple to enable formally proving the SCA resilience of masked implementations on an algorithmic level. In the context of hardware implementations, the robust probing model has become highly relevant for proving SCA resilience due to its capability to model physical defaults like glitches and data transitions. As constructing a correct and secure masked variant of large and complex circuits is a challenging task, a new line of research has recently emerged, aiming to design small, masked subcircuits - realizing for instance a simple AND gate - which still guarantee security when composed to a larger circuit. Although several designs realizing such composable subcircuits - commonly referred to as gadgets - have been proposed, negligible research was conducted in order to find trade-offs between different overhead metrics, like randomness requirement, latency, and area consumption.'}

	abstract = {'Classification tasks on labeled graph-structured data have many important applications ranging from social recommendation to financial modeling. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used for node classification on graphs, wherein nodes with similar features have to be given the same label. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are one such widely studied neural network architecture that perform well on this task. However, powerful link-stealing attacks on GCNs have recently shown that even with black-box access to the trained model, inferring which links (or edges) are present in the training graph is practical. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture called LPGNet for training on graphs with privacy-sensitive edges. LPGNet provides differential privacy (DP) guarantees for edges using a novel design for how graph edge structure is used during training. We empirically show that LPGNet models often lie in the sweet spot between providing privacy and utility: They can offer better utility than "trivially" private architectures which use no edge information (e.g., vanilla MLPs) and better resilience against existing link-stealing attacks than vanilla GCNs which use the full edge structure. LPGNet also offers consistently better privacy-utility tradeoffs than DPGCN, which is the state-of-the-art mechanism for retrofitting differential privacy into conventional GCNs, in most of our evaluated datasets.'}

	abstract = {"Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is increasingly being used to address privacy issues in various applications. The recent work of Alon et al. (CRYPTO'20) identified the shortcomings of traditional MPC and defined a Friends-and-Foes (FaF) security notion to address the same. We showcase the need for FaF security in real-world applications such as dark pools. This subsequently necessitates designing concretely efficient FaF-secure protocols. Towards this, keeping efficiency at the center stage, we design ring-based FaF-secure MPC protocols in the small-party honest-majority setting. Specifically, we provide (1,1)-FaF secure 5 party computation protocols (5PC) that consider one malicious and one semi-honest corruption and constitutes the optimal setting for attaining honest-majority. At the heart of it lies the multiplication protocol that requires a single round of communication with 8 ring elements (amortized). To facilitate having FaF-secure variants for several applications, we design a variety of building blocks optimized for our FaF setting. The practicality of the designed (1,1)-FaF secure 5PC framework is showcased by benchmarking dark pools. In the process, we also improve the efficiency and security of the dark pool protocols over the existing traditionally secure ones. This improvement is witnessed as a gain of up to 62x in throughput compared to the existing ones. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of our framework, we also benchmark popular deep neural networks."}

Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another.'}

	abstract = {'Hardware enclaves rely on a disjoint memory model, which maps each physical address to an enclave to achieve strong memory isolation. However, this severely limits the performance and programmability of enclave programs. While some prior work proposes enclave memory sharing, it does not provide a formal model or verification of their designs. This paper presents Cerberus, a formal approach to secure and efficient enclave memory sharing. To reduce the burden of formal verification, we compare different sharing models and choose a simple yet powerful sharing model. Based on the sharing model, Cerberus extends an enclave platform such that enclave memory can be made immutable and shareable across multiple enclaves via additional operations. We use incremental verification starting with an existing formal model called the Trusted Abstract Platform (TAP). Using our extended TAP model, we formally verify that Cerberus does not break or weaken the security guarantees of the enclaves despite allowing memory sharing. More specifically, we prove the Secure Remote Execution (SRE) property on our formal model. Finally, the paper shows the feasibility of Cerberus by implementing it in an existing enclave platform, RISC-V Keystone.'}

	abstract = {"The use of smartphones as voice recorders has made it easy to record audios as proof of conversations, but sharing of such audio evidence incurs speech and voice privacy risks. However, protecting speech/voice privacy without losing audio authenticity is challenging. The conventional post-process redaction and voice conversion of audio recordings, which invalidate their original signatures, make the audio unverifiable and prone to tampering. In this paper, we present Overo, an audio recording/sharing solution that supports privacy processing without losing audio authenticity. Overo records a realtime audio stream in the standard AAC-encoded format and allows privacy post-processing prior to sharing of audios while keeping their original signatures valid (even after the post redaction and voice conversion), guaranteeing no tampering since the time of their recording. Therefore, users can post-process their recordings to desired levels of privacy on speech (what content to redact) and speakers (whose voice to disguise) at the time of audio release, and still prove their authenticity. Overo is readily implementable in today's commodity smartphones. Our prototype on iPhones/Android phones demonstrates the production of AAC-compliant, tamperproof, and self-authenticating audios with speech/voice privacy protected based on users' post-recording decisions."}

	abstract = {"In today's web ecosystem, a website that uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) shares its Transport Layer Security (TLS) private key or session key with the CDN. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of InviCloak, a system that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a user and a website's private communications without changing TLS or upgrading a CDN. InviCloak builds a lightweight but secure and practical key distribution mechanism using the existing DNS infrastructure to distribute a new public key associated with a website's domain name. A web client and a website can use the new key pair to build an encryption channel inside TLS. InviCloak accommodates the current web ecosystem. A website can deploy InviCloak unilaterally without a client's involvement to prevent a passive attacker inside a CDN from eavesdropping on their communications. If a client also installs InviCloak's browser extension, the client and the website can achieve end-to-end confidential and untampered communications in the presence of an active attacker inside a CDN. Our evaluation shows that InviCloak increases the median page load times (PLTs) of realistic web pages from 2.0s to 2.1s, which is smaller than the median PLTs (2.8s) of a state-of-the-art TEE-based solution."}

Using this vulnerability, a bad actor could fulfill privilege escalation without triggering existing kernel protection and exploit mitigation, making this vulnerability particularly disconcerting. However, the success of DirtyPipe exploitation heavily relies on this vulnerability's capability (i.e., injecting data into the arbitrary file through Linux's pipes). Such an ability is rarely seen for other kernel vulnerabilities, making the defense relatively easy. As long as Linux users eliminate the vulnerability, the system could be relatively secure."}

	abstract = {'Modern processors dynamically control their operating frequency to optimize resource utilization, maximize energy savings, and conform to system-defined constraints. If, during the execution of a software workload, the running average of any electrical or thermal parameter exceeds its corresponding predefined threshold value, the power management architecture will reactively adjust CPU frequency to ensure safe operating conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate how such power management-based frequency throttling activity forms a source of timing side-channel information leakage, which can be exploited by an attacker to infer secret data even from a constant-cycle victim workload. The proposed frequency throttling side-channel attack can be launched by both kernel-space and user-space attackers, thus compromising security guarantees provided by isolation boundaries. We validate our attack methodology across different systems and threat models by performing experiments on a constant-cycle implementation of AES algorithm based on AES-NI instructions. The results of our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the attacker can successfully recover all bytes of an AES key by measuring encryption execution times. Finally, we discuss different options to mitigate the threat posed by frequency throttling side-channel attacks, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.'}

	abstract = {'Cloud gaming has become an emerging computing paradigm in recent years, allowing computer games to offload complex graphics and logic computation to the cloud. To deliver a smooth and high-quality gaming experience, cloud gaming services have invested abundant computing resources in the cloud, including adequate CPUs, top-tier GPUs, and high-bandwidth Internet connections. Unfortunately, the abundant computing resources offered by cloud gaming are vulnerable to misuse and exploitation for malicious purposes. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on security vulnerabilities in cloud gaming services. Specifically, we reveal that adversaries can purposely inject malicious programs/URLs into the cloud gaming services via game mods. Using the provided features such as in-game subroutines, game launch options, and built-in browsers, adversaries are able to execute the injected malicious programs/URLs in cloud gaming services. To demonstrate that such vulnerabilities pose a serious threat, we conduct four proof-of-concept attacks on cloud gaming services. Two of them are to abuse the CPUs and GPUs in cloud gaming services to mine cryptocurrencies with attractive profits and train machine learning models at a trivial cost. The other two are to exploit the high-bandwidth connections provided by cloud gaming for malicious Command & Control and censorship circumvention. Finally, we present several countermeasures for cloud gaming services to protect their valuable assets from malicious exploitation.'}

	abstract = {'Neural text ranking models have witnessed significant advancement and are increasingly being deployed in practice. Unfortunately, they also inherit adversarial vulnerabilities of general neural models, which have been detected but remain underexplored by prior studies. Moreover, the inherit adversarial vulnerabilities might be leveraged by blackhat SEO to defeat better-protected search engines. In this study, we propose an imitation adversarial attack on black-box neural passage ranking models. We first show that the target passage ranking model can be transparentized and imitated by enumerating critical queries/candidates and then train a ranking imitation model. Leveraging the ranking imitation model, we can elaborately manipulate the ranking results and transfer the manipulation attack to the target ranking model. For this purpose, we propose an innovative gradient-based attack method, empowered by the pairwise objective function, to generate adversarial triggers, which causes premeditated disorderliness with very few tokens. To equip the trigger camouflages, we add the next sentence prediction loss and the language model fluency constraint to the objective function. Experimental results on passage ranking demonstrate the effectiveness of the ranking imitation attack model and adversarial triggers against various SOTA neural ranking models. Furthermore, various mitigation analyses and human evaluation show the effectiveness of camouflages when facing potential mitigation approaches. To motivate other scholars to further investigate this novel and important problem, we make the experiment data and code publicly available.'}

	abstract = {'Crowd counting, which has been widely adopted for estimating the number of people in safety-critical scenes, is shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples in the physical world (e.g., adversarial patches). Though harmful, adversarial examples are also valuable for evaluating and better understanding model robustness. However, existing adversarial example generation methods for crowd counting lack strong transferability among different black-box models, which limits their practicability for real-world systems. Motivated by the fact that attacking transferability is positively correlated to the model-invariant characteristics, this paper proposes the Perceptual Adversarial Patch (PAP) generation framework to tailor the adversarial perturbations for crowd counting scenes using the model-shared perceptual features. Specifically, we handcraft an adaptive crowd density weighting approach to capture the invariant scale perception features across various models and utilize the density guided attention to capture the model-shared position perception. Both of them are demonstrated to improve the attacking transferability of our adversarial patches. Extensive experiments show that our PAP could achieve state-of-the-art attacking performance in both the digital and physical world, and outperform previous proposals by large margins (at most +685.7 MAE and +699.5 MSE). Besides, we empirically demonstrate that adversarial training with our PAP can benefit the performance of vanilla models in alleviating several practical challenges in crowd counting scenarios, including generalization across datasets (up to -376.0 MAE and -354.9 MSE) and robustness towards complex backgrounds (up to -10.3 MAE and -16.4 MSE).'}

	abstract = {"Machine learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to predict whether or not a particular sample was contained in the target model's training dataset. Existing attack methods have commonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the given target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member and non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are naturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new attack method, called TrajectoryMIA, which can exploit the membership information from the whole training process of the target model for improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common black-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the membership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate models at different distillation epochs, namely distilled loss trajectory, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental results over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great advantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on CINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6 times higher true-positive rate at a low false-positive rate of 0.1% than existing methods. Further analysis demonstrates the general effectiveness of our attack in more strict scenarios."}

Using rich data from the Ethereum blockchain, the mempool, and exchanges, we study the effect of EIP-1559, one of the earliest-deployed TFMs that depart from the traditional first-price auction paradigm. We conduct a rigorous and comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on blockchain transaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting times, and consensus security. Our results show that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by mitigating intrablock differences in the gas price paid and reducing users' waiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee levels and consensus security. In addition, we find that when Ether's price is more volatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a larger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest new directions for improving TFMs."}

	abstract = {"Pre-trained encoders are general-purpose feature extractors that can be used for many downstream tasks. Recent progress in self-supervised learning can pre-train highly effective encoders using a large volume of unlabeled data, leading to the emerging encoder as a service (EaaS). A pre-trained encoder may be deemed confidential because its training often requires lots of data and computation resources as well as its public release may facilitate misuse of AI, e.g., for deepfakes generation. In this paper, we propose the first attack called StolenEncoder to steal pre-trained image encoders. We evaluate StolenEncoder on multiple target encoders pre-trained by ourselves and three real-world target encoders including the ImageNet encoder pre-trained by Google, CLIP encoder pre-trained by OpenAI, and Clarifai's General Embedding encoder deployed as a paid EaaS. Our results show that the encoders stolen by StolenEncoder have similar functionality with the target encoders. In particular, the downstream classifiers built upon a target encoder and a stolen encoder have similar accuracy. Moreover, stealing a target encoder using StolenEncoder requires much less data and computation resources than pre-training it from scratch. We also explore three defenses that perturb feature vectors produced by a target encoder. Our evaluation shows that these defenses are not enough to mitigate StolenEncoder."}

Neural Trojans embedded in pre-trained neural networks are a harmful attack against the DNN model supply chain. They generate false outputs when certain stealthy triggers appear in the inputs. While data-poisoning attacks have been well studied in the literature, code-poisoning and model-poisoning backdoors only start to attract attention until recently. We present a novel model-poisoning neural Trojan, namely LoneNeuron, which responds to feature-domain patterns that transform into invisible, sample-specific, and polymorphic pixel-domain watermarks. With high attack specificity, LoneNeuron achieves a 100% attack success rate, while not affecting the main task performance. With LoneNeuron's unique watermark polymorphism property, the same feature-domain trigger is resolved to multiple watermarks in the pixel domain, which further improves watermark randomness, stealthiness, and resistance against Trojan detection. Extensive experiments show that LoneNeuron could escape state-of-the-art Trojan detectors. LoneNeuron~is also the first effective backdoor attack against vision transformers (ViTs)."}

For its high efficiency, static taint analysis is widely adopted to detect taint-style vulnerabilities before application deployment. Unfortunately, due to the high complexity of the PHP language, implementing a precise static taint analysis is difficult.

	abstract = {'We present a protocol in the shuffle model of differential privacy (DP) for the frequency estimation problem that achieves error ω(1) ⋅ O(log n), almost matching the central-DP accuracy, with 1 + o(1) messages per user. This exhibits a sharp transition phenomenon, as there is a lower bound of Ω (n1/4) if each user is allowed to send only one message. Previously, such a result is only known when the domain size B is o(n). For a large domain, we also need an efficient method to identify the heavy hitters (i.e., elements that are frequent enough). For this purpose, we design a shuffle-DP protocol that uses o(1) messages per user and can identify all heavy hitters in time polylogarithmic in B. Finally, by combining our frequency estimation and the heavy hitter detection protocols, we show how to solve the B-dimensional 1-sparse vector summation problem in the high-dimensional setting B=Ω(n), achieving the optimal central-DP MSE Õ(n) with 1 + o(1) messages per user. In addition to error and message number, our protocols improve in terms of message size and running time as well. They are also very easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvement over prior work.'}

	abstract = {'There is great demand for scalable, secure, and efficient privacy-preserving machine learning models that can be trained over distributed data. While deep learning models typically achieve the best results in a centralized non-secure setting, different models can excel when privacy and communication constraints are imposed. Instead, tree-based approaches such as XGBoost have attracted much attention for their high performance and ease of use; in particular, they often achieve state-of-the-art results on tabular data. Consequently, several recent works have focused on translating Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models like XGBoost into federated settings, via cryptographic mechanisms such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). However, these do not always provide formal privacy guarantees, or consider the full range of hyperparameters and implementation settings. In this work, we implement the GBDT model under Differential Privacy (DP). We propose a general framework that captures and extends existing approaches for differentially private decision trees. Our framework of methods is tailored to the federated setting, and we show that with a careful choice of techniques it is possible to achieve very high utility while maintaining strong levels of privacy.'}

It requires no access to source code and only lightweight execution monitoring of the implementation under test. We demonstrate and evaluate StateInspector's effectiveness on numerous TLS and WPA/2 implementations. In the process, we show StateInspector enables deeper state discovery, increased learning efficiency, and more insight compared to existing approaches. Our method led us to discover several concerning deviations from the standards and vulnerabilities in IWD and WolfSSL, both of which were assigned CVEs."}

	abstract = {"A secure reset operation could be an enabling technology that allows sharing of a quantum computer among different users, or among different quantum programs of the same user. Today, the dominant method to erase the qubit state is a full system wipe, which effectively resets all the qubits at the same time. In today's superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example, a full system wipe takes up to 1000 μs, and it fully erases all information in the system. However, with a full system wipe there is no means for only a few qubits to be cleared and assigned to a new user or program; everything has to be erased at the same time. A secure reset operation could allow resetting only a subset of qubits, and it could be built upon existing (insecure) reset operation available from superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example. The (insecure) reset operation is available today, which can be used to reset the state of a qubit in a time on the order of 10 μs down to 1 μs. The reset operation is thus much faster than a full system wipe. However, as this work demonstrates, it is possible to leak some information across the (insecure) reset operation as it does not perfectly reset the qubit state between two users or programs who may be sequentially scheduled on the same qubit. Further, crosstalk-like effects are observed where reset behavior of one qubit can be inferred from an adjacent qubit. This work analyzes the existing (insecure) reset operation in order to understand how a secure reset operation could be built upon it. This work then describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed secure reset operation which can reset qubits without leaking information, and retains a factor of 300 speedup over a full system~wipe."}

	abstract = {"Dynamic participation support is an important feature of Bitcoin's longest-chain protocol and its variants. But these protocols suffer from long latency as a fundamental trade-off. Specifically, the latency depends at least on the following two factors: 1) the desired security level of the protocol, and 2) the actual participation level of the network. Classic BFT protocols, on the other hand, can achieve constant latency but cannot make progress under dynamic participation. In this work, we present a protocol that simultaneously supports dynamic participation and achieves constant latency. Our core technique is to extend the classic BFT approach from static quorum size to dynamic quorum size, i.e., according to the current participation level, while preserving important properties of static quorum. We also present a recovery mechanism for rejoining nodes that is efficient in terms of both communication and storage. Our experimental evaluation shows our protocol has much lower latency than a longest-chain protocol, especially when there is a sudden decrease of participation."}

	abstract = {"Modern autonomous systems rely on both object detection and object tracking in their visual perception pipelines. Although many recent works have attacked the object detection component of autonomous vehicles, these attacks do not work on full pipelines that integrate object tracking to enhance the object detector's accuracy. Meanwhile, existing attacks against object tracking either lack real-world applicability or do not work against a powerful class of object trackers, Siamese trackers. In this paper, we present AttrackZone, a new physically-realizable tracker hijacking attack against Siamese trackers that systematically determines valid regions in an environment that can be used for physical perturbations. AttrackZone exploits the heatmap generation process of Siamese Region Proposal Networks in order to take control of an object's bounding box, resulting in physical consequences including vehicle collisions and masked intrusion of pedestrians into unauthorized areas. Evaluations in both the digital and physical domain show that AttrackZone achieves its attack goals 92% of the time, requiring only 0.3-3 seconds on average."}

	abstract = {'We study the security of triple encryption in the multi-user setting with its application to Triple DES (TDES) in mind. Although depreciation of TDES is a global trend, the migration will take the next decade, considering the billions of TDES hardware the industry has invested so far. The multi-user security captures the reality of practical systems with multiple users, substantially impacts security, and is already considered in practical protocols such as TLS 1.3. The best multi-user lower bound of TDES is 43-(3/2) \\cdot łog_2 u bits with u users, which is tractable with a standard PC and is unacceptably low. We devise a new proof to improve the multi-user security and show its tightness by giving a concrete attack. The new bound with the TDES parameters is 79-(1/2) \\cdot łog_2 u bits. We also propose TEFX that strengthens triple encryption with the FX construction while preserving the compatibility with legacy hardware. TDES with TEFX achieves the multi-user security of 114-(1/2) \\cdot łog_2 q bits with q TEFX calls: it achieves 84.5 bits with 2^40 users and 2^21 TEFX calls for each user, which is comparable to that of AES (128-40=88 bits).'}

	abstract = {'Public cloud platforms have leveraged Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to provide confidential computing services. However, TEE-protected applications still suffer from rollback or forking attacks, in which their states could be rolled back to a stale version or be forked into multiple versions, resulting in state continuity violations. Existing solutions against these attacks either rely on weak threat models based on centralized trust (e.g., trusted server) or suffer from large performance overheads (e.g., tens of state updates per second). In this paper, we propose Narrator, a secure and practical system, (1) that relies on a blockchain (i.e., decentralized trust) and TEEs, and (2) that provides high-performance state continuity protection like unlimited and fast state updates for applications in cloud TEEs. The intuition behind our design is simple. Our design uses the blockchain to initialize a distributed system of TEEs, laying down the decentralized trust base with a small interaction overhead, while the distributed system provides performant state continuity protection. Our distributed system adopts a customized version of the consistent broadcast protocol and leverages advanced techniques to make state updates processed with one round trip delay on average. We build a proof-of-concept of Narrator on Intel SGX (i.e., a representative design of TEEs) and do extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that in a LAN environment with 5 nodes, Narrator can support about 6k state updates per second, meanwhile keeping the latency as low as 3-8 ms. The throughput is 30x larger than that in ROTE and 70x larger than using a TPM counter.'}

Ad networks are incentivized to tie ephemeral cookies across devices to lasting durable identifiers such as email addresses in order to develop comprehensive cross-device user profiles. Third-party ad networks typically do not have relationships with users and must rely on external parties such as merchant websites for durable identity information, introducing intricate trust relationships. We find attackers can exploit these trust relationships to confuse an ad network into linking an unprivileged attacker\'s browser to a victim\'s identity, thus "impersonating" the victim to the ad network.'}

	abstract = {'As privacy features in Android operating system improve, privacy-invasive apps may gradually shift their focus to non-standard and covert channels for leaking private user/device information. Such leaks also remain largely undetected by state-of-the-art privacy analysis tools, which are very effective in uncovering privacy exposures via regular HTTP and HTTPS channels. In this study, we design and implement, ThirdEye, to significantly extend the visibility of current privacy analysis tools, in terms of the exposures that happen across various non-standard and covert channels, i.e., via any protocol over TCP/UDP (beyond HTTP/S), and using multi-layer custom encryption over HTTP/S and non-HTTP protocols. Besides network exposures, we also consider covert channels via storage media that also leverage custom encryption layers. Using ThirdEye, we analyzed 12,598 top-apps in various categories from Androidrank, and found that 2887/12,598 (22.92%) apps used custom encryption/decryption for network transmission and storing content in shared device storage, and 2465/2887 (85.38%) of those apps sent device information (e.g., advertising ID, list of installed apps) over the network that can fingerprint users. Besides, 299 apps transmitted insecure encrypted content over HTTP/non-HTTP protocols; 22 apps that used authentication tokens over HTTPS, happen to expose them over insecure (albeit custom encrypted) HTTP/non-HTTP channels. We found non-standard and covert channels with multiple levels of obfuscation (e.g., encrypted data over HTTPS, encryption at nested levels), and the use of vulnerable keys and cryptographic algorithms. Our findings can provide valuable insights into the evolving field of non-standard and covert channels, and help spur new countermeasures against such privacy leakage and security issues.'}

In this paper, we formalize the OAuth specifications and security best practices, and design Cerberus, an automated static analyzer, to find logical flaws and identify vulnerabilities in the implementation of OAuth service provider libraries. To efficiently detect security violations in a large codebase of service provider implementation, Cerberus employs a query-driven algorithm for answering queries about OAuth specifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cerberus by evaluating it on datasets of popular OAuth libraries with millions of downloads. Among these high-profile libraries, Cerberus has identified 47 vulnerabilities from ten classes of logical flaws, 24 of which were previously unknown. We got acknowledged by the developers of eight libraries and had three accepted CVEs.'}

	abstract = {"We are witnessing a heightened surge in remote privacy attacks on laptop computers. These attacks often exploit malware to remotely gain access to webcams and microphones in order to spy on the victim users. While webcam attacks are somewhat defended with widely available commercial webcam privacy covers, unfortunately, there are no adequate solutions to thwart the attacks on mics despite recent industry efforts. As a first step towards defending against such attacks on laptop mics, we propose TickTock, a novel mic on/off status detection system. To achieve this, TickTock externally probes the electromagnetic (EM) emanations that stem from the connectors and cables of the laptop circuitry carrying mic clock signals. This is possible because the mic clock signals are only input during the mic recording state, causing resulting emanations. We design and implement a proof-of-concept system to demonstrate TickTock's feasibility. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate TickTock on a total of 30 popular laptops executing a variety of applications to successfully detect mic status in 27 laptops. Of these, TickTock consistently identifies mic recording with high true positive and negative rates."}

	abstract = {"Ciphertexts of an order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme preserve the order of their corresponding plaintexts. However, OPEs are vulnerable to inference attacks that exploit this preserved order. Differential privacy (DP) has become the de-facto standard for data privacy. One of the most attractive properties of DP is that any post-processing computation, such as inference attacks, performed on the noisy output of a DP algorithm does not degrade its privacy guarantee. In this work, we propose a novel differentially private order preserving encryption scheme, OP ε. Under OP ε, the leakage of order from the ciphertexts is differentially private. Consequently, in the least, OP ε ensures a formal guarantee (a relaxed DP guarantee) even in the face of inference attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine DP with a OPE. OP ε is based on a novel differentially private order preserving encoding scheme, OPεc, that can be of independent interest in the local DP setting. We demonstrate OP ε's utility in answering range queries via empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets. For instance, OP ε misses only around 4 in every 10K correct records on average for a dataset of size ~732K with an attribute of domain size ~18K and ε= 1."}

	abstract = {'Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaborate with a server to train a machine learning model. To ensure privacy, the server performs secure aggregation of updates from the clients. Unfortunately, this prevents verification of the well-formedness (integrity) of the updates as the updates are masked. Consequently, malformed updates designed to poison the model can be injected without detection. In this paper, we formalize the problem of ensuring both update privacy and integrity in FL and present a new system, EIFFeL, that enables secure aggregation of verified updates. EIFFeL is a general framework that can enforce arbitrary integrity checks and remove malformed updates from the aggregate, without violating privacy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the practicality of EIFFeL. For instance, with 100 clients and 10% poisoning, EIFFeL can train an MNIST classification model to the same accuracy as that of a non-poisoned federated learner in just 2.4s per iteration.'}

However, existing Schnorr threshold signature schemes still fall short of the needs of real-world applications due to their assumption that the network is synchronous and due to their lack of robustness, i.e., the guarantee that t honest signers are able to obtain a valid signature even in the presence of other malicious signers who try to disrupt the protocol. This hinders the adoption of threshold signatures in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, e.g., in second-layer protocols built on top of cryptocurrencies."}

Such frameworks often use compaction and shuffling as core primitives. However, due to advances in TEE side-channel attacks, these primitives, and the applications that use them, should be fully oblivious; that is, perform instruction sequences and memory accesses that do not depend on the secret inputs. Such obliviousness would eliminate the threat of leaking private information through memory or timing side channels, but achieving it naively can result in a significant performance cost.'}

These characteristics, however, bring additional security risks, such as the Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) attack, to serverless tenants. In this paper, we perform a real-world DoW attack on commodity serverless platforms to evaluate its severity. To identify such attacks, we design, implement, and evaluate Gringotts, an accurate, easy-to-use DoW detection system with a negligible performance overhead. Gringotts addresses the information ambiguity inherent in serverless functions by introducing a well-designed performance metrics collection agent. Then, Gringotts uses the Mahalanobis distance to discover anomalies in the distribution of the metrics. We implement Gringotts as a real system and conduct extensive experiments using a testbed to evaluate the performance of Gringotts. Our results indicate that Gringotts has a performance overhead of less than 1.1%, with an average detection delay of 1.86 seconds and an average accuracy of over 95.75%.'}

Little attention has been paid to understand the privacy risks of integrating the output from graph embedding models (e.g., node embeddings) with complex downstream machine learning pipelines. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel model-agnostic graph recovery attack that exploits the implicit graph structural information preserved in the embeddings of graph nodes. We show that an adversary can recover edges with decent accuracy by only gaining access to the node embedding matrix of the original graph without interactions with the node embedding models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our graph recovery attack through extensive experiments.'}

	abstract = {"Chatbots are used in many applications, e.g., automated agents, smart home assistants, interactive characters in online games, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure they do not behave in undesired manners, providing offensive or toxic responses to users. This is not a trivial task as state-of-the-art chatbot models are trained on large, public datasets openly collected from the Internet. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, large-scale measurement of toxicity in chatbots. We show that publicly available chatbots are prone to providing toxic responses when fed toxic queries. Even more worryingly, some non-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design and experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective against public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious queries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms against ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at the cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating a portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the computer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models do not hurt their users. Overall, we are confident that ToxicBuddy can be used as an auditing tool and that our work will pave the way toward designing more effective defenses for chatbot safety."}

	abstract = {"Browser fingerprinting continues to proliferate across the web. Critically, popular fingerprinting libraries have started incorporating extension-fingerprinting capabilities, thus exacerbating the privacy loss they can induce. In this paper we propose continuous fingerprinting, a novel extension fingerprinting technique that captures a critical dimension of extensions' functionality that allowed them to elude all prior behavior-based techniques. Specifically, we find that ephemeral modifications are prevalent in the extension ecosystem, effectively rendering such extensions invisible to prior approaches that are confined to analyzing snapshots that capture a single moment in time. Accordingly, we develop Chronos, a system that captures the modifications that occur throughout an extension's life cycle, enabling it to fingerprint extensions that make transient modifications that leave no visible traces at the end of execution. Specifically, our system creates behavioral signatures that capture nodes being added to or removed from the DOM, as well as changes being made to node attributes. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights the inherent limits of prior snapshot-based approaches, as Chronos is able to identify 11,219 unique extensions, increasing coverage by 66.9% over the state of the art. Additionally, we find that our system captures a unique modification event (i.e., mutation) for 94% of the extensions, while also being able to resolve 97% of the signature collisions across extensions that affect existing snapshot-based approaches. Our study more accurately captures the extent of the privacy threat presented by extension fingerprinting, which warrants more attention by privacy-oriented browser vendors that, up to this point, have focused on deploying countermeasures against other browser fingerprinting vectors."}

However, typical business scenarios often follow a hierarchical architecture where a powerful, usuallyprivileged party, leads the tasks of machine learning.

	abstract = {'We present Bullshark, the first directed acyclic graph (DAG) based asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast protocol that is optimized for the common synchronous case. Like previous DAG-based BFT protocols [19, 25], Bullshark requires no extra communication to achieve consensus on top of building the DAG. That is, parties can totally order the vertices of the DAG by interpreting their local view of the DAG edges. Unlike other asynchronous DAG-based protocols, Bullshark provides a practical low latency fast-path that exploits synchronous periods and deprecates the need for notoriously complex view-change and view-synchronization mechanisms. Bullshark achieves this while maintaining all the desired properties of its predecessor DAG-Rider [25]. Namely, it has optimal amortized communication complexity, it provides fairness and asynchronous liveness, and safety is guaranteed even under a quantum adversary.'}

	abstract = {"With its critical role in business and service delivery through mobile devices, SMS (Short Message Service) has long been abused for spamming, which is still on the rise today possibly due to the emergence of A2P bulk messaging. The effort to control SMS spam has been hampered by the lack of up-to-date information about illicit activities. In our research, we proposed a novel solution to collect recent SMS spam data, at a large scale, from Twitter, where users voluntarily report the spam messages they receive. For this purpose, we designed and implemented SpamHunter, an automated pipeline to discover SMS spam reporting tweets and extract message content from the attached screenshots. Leveraging SpamHunter, we collected from Twitter a dataset of 21,918 SMS spam messages in 75 languages, spanning over four years. To our best knowledge, this is the largest SMS spam dataset ever made public. More importantly, SpamHunter enables us to continuously monitor emerging SMS spam messages, which facilitates the ongoing effort to mitigate SMS spamming. We also performed an in-depth measurement study that sheds light on the new trends in the spammer's strategies, infrastructure and spam campaigns. We also utilized our spam SMS data to evaluate the robustness of the spam countermeasures put in place by the SMS ecosystem, including anti-spam services, bulk SMS services, and text messaging apps. Our evaluation shows that such protection cannot effectively handle those spam samples: either introducing significant false positives or missing a large number of newly reported spam messages."}

Our work, NeVerMore, discovers new vulnerabilities in RDMA protocols that unveils several attack vectors on RDMA-enabled applications and the NVMe-oF protocol, showing that the current security mechanisms of the NVMe-oF protocol do not address the security vulnerabilities posed by the use of RDMA. In particular, we show how an unprivileged user can inject packets into any RDMA connection created on a local network controller, bypassing security mechanisms of the operating system and its kernel, and how the injection can be used to acquire unauthorized block access to NVMe-oF devices. Overall, we implement four attacks on RDMA protocols and seven attacks on the NVMe-oF protocol and verify them on the two most popular implementations of NVMe-oF: SPDK and the Linux kernel. To mitigate the discovered attacks we propose multiple mechanisms that can be implemented by RDMA and NVMe-oF providers.'}

	abstract = {"Location-based services (LBS) have been significantly developed and widely deployed in mobile devices. It is also well-known that LBS applications may result in severe privacy concerns by collecting sensitive locations. A strong privacy model ''local differential privacy'' (LDP) has been recently deployed in many different applications (e.g., Google RAPPOR, iOS, and Microsoft Telemetry) but not effective for LBS applications due to the low utility of existing LDP mechanisms. To address such deficiency, we propose the first LDP framework for a variety of location-based services (namely ''L-SRR''), which privately collects and analyzes user locations with high utility. Specifically, we design a novel randomization mechanism ''Staircase Randomized Response'' (SRR) and extend the empirical estimation to significantly boost the utility for SRR in different LBS applications (e.g., traffic density estimation, and k-nearest neighbors). We have conducted extensive experiments on four real LBS datasets by benchmarking with other LDP schemes in practical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that L-SRR significantly outperforms them."}

	abstract = {'This paper presents the first critical analysis of building highly secure, performant, and confidential Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus by integrating off-the-shelf crash fault-tolerant (CFT) protocols with trusted execution environments (TEEs). TEEs, like Intel SGX, are CPU extensions that offer applications a secure execution environment with strong integrity and confidentiality guarantees, by leveraging techniques like hardware-assisted isolation, memory encryption, and remote attestation. It has been speculated that when implementing a CFT protocol inside Intel SGX, one would achieve security properties similar to BFT. However, we show in this work that simply combining CFT with SGX does not directly yield a secure BFT protocol, given the wide range of attack vectors on SGX. We systematically study the fallacies in such a strawman design by performing model checking, and propose solutions to enforce safety and liveness. We also present ENGRAFT, a secure enclave-guarded Raft implementation that, firstly, achieves consensus on a cluster of 2f+1 machines tolerating up to f nodes exhibiting Byzantine-fault behavior (but well-behaved enclaves); secondly, offers a new abstraction of confidential consensus for privacy-preserving state machine replication; and finally, allows the reuse of a production-quality Raft implementation, BRaft, in the development of a highly performant BFT system.'}

	abstract = {"Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) models are vulnerable to privacy attacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the target model, and focus on a particular type of privacy attack named property inference attack (PIA) which infers the sensitive properties of the training graph through the access to GNNs. While the existing work has investigated PIAs against graph-level properties (e.g., node degree and graph density), we are the first to perform a systematic study of the group property inference attacks (GPIAs) that infer the distribution of particular groups of nodes and links (e.g., there are more links between male nodes than those between female nodes) in the training graph. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat models with various types of adversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on three representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Third, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute to GPIA's success, and show that the GNN model trained on the graphs with or without the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters and/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the property. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA attacks, and demonstrate empirically that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy effectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy."}

	abstract = {'Nowadays, differential privacy (DP) has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection, and deep neural networks (DNN) have been immensely successful in machine learning. The combination of these two techniques, i.e., deep learning with differential privacy, promises the privacy-preserving release of high-utility models trained with sensitive data such as medical records. A classic mechanism for this purpose is DP-SGD, which is a differentially private version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer commonly used for DNN training. Subsequent approaches have improved various aspects of the model training process, including noise decay schedule, model architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. However, the core mechanism for enforcing DP in the SGD optimizer remains unchanged ever since the original DP-SGD algorithm, which has increasingly become a fundamental barrier limiting the performance of DP-compliant machine learning solutions.'}

	abstract = {'Recent works on interactive zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols provide a new paradigm with high efficiency and scalability. However, these protocols suffer from high communication overhead, often linear to the circuit size. In this paper, we proposed two new ZK protocols with communication sublinear to the circuit size, while maintaining a similar level of computational efficiency.(1) We designed a ZK protocol that can prove B executions of any circuit C in communication O(B + |C|) field elements (with free addition gates), while the best prior work requires a communication of O(B|C|) field elements. Our protocol is enabled by a new tool called as information-theoretic polynomial authentication code, which may be of independent interest.(2) We developed an optimized implementation of this protocol which shows high practicality. For example, with B=2048, |C|=221, and under 50 Mbps bandwidth and 16 threads, QuickSilver, a state-of-the-art ZK protocol based on vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE), can only prove 0.71 million MULT gates per second (mgps) and send one field element per gate; our protocol can prove 15.74 mgps (22x improvement) and send 0.0061 field elements per gate (164x improvement) under the same hardware configuration.(3) Extending the above idea, we constructed a ZK protocol that can prove a single execution of any circuit C in communication O(|C|3/4). This is the first ZK protocol with sublinear communication for an arbitrary circuit in the VOLE-based ZK family.'}

Over the years, numerous tools to automatically detect timing leakage or even to prove their absence have been proposed. However, a recent study at IEEE S&P 2022 showed that, while many developers are aware of one or more analysis tools, they have major difficulties integrating these into their workflow, as existing tools are tedious to use and mapping discovered leakages to their originating code segments requires expert knowledge. In addition, existing tools focus on compiled languages like C, or analyze binaries, while the industry and open-source community moved to interpreted languages, most notably JavaScript.'}

	abstract = {'Biometric authentication schemes, i.e., fingerprint and face authentication, raise serious privacy concerns. To alleviate such concerns, hand authentication has been proposed recently. However, existing hand authentication schemes use dedicated hardware, such as infrared or depth cameras, which are not available on commodity mobile devices. In this paper, we present EchoHand, a high accuracy and presentation attack resistant authentication scheme that complements camera-based 2-dimensional hand geometry recognition of one hand with active acoustic sensing of the other holding hand. EchoHand plays an inaudible acoustic signal using the speaker to actively sense the holding hand and collects the echoes using the microphone. EchoHand does not rely on any specialized hardware but uses the built-in speaker, microphone and camera. Moreover, EchoHand does not place more burdens on users than existing hand authentication methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the reliability and security of EchoHand. The results show that EchoHand has a low equal error rate of 2.45% with as few as 10 training data points and it defeats presentation attacks.'}

	abstract = {'Due to the popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the increasing digitalization of payments, and the constantly reducing role of cash in society, central banks have shown an increased interest in deploying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could serve as a digital cash-equivalent. While most recent research on CBDCs focuses on blockchain technology, it is not clear that this choice of technology provides the optimal solution. In particular, the centralized trust model of a CBDC offers opportunities for different designs. In this paper, we depart from blockchain designs and instead build on ideas from traditional e-cash schemes. We propose a new style of building digital currencies that combines the transaction processing model of e-cash with an account-based fund management model. We argue that such a style of building digital currencies is especially well-suited to CBDCs. We also design the first such digital currency system, called Platypus, that provides strong privacy, high scalability, and expressive but simple regulation, which are all critical features for a CBDC. Platypus achieves these properties by adapting techniques similar to those used in anonymous blockchain cryptocurrencies like Zcash to fit our account model and applying them to the e-cash context.'}

	abstract = {'To protect against naturally occurring or adversely induced congestion in the Internet, we propose the concept of flyover reservations, a fundamentally new approach for addressing the availability demands of critical low-volume applications. In contrast to path-based reservation systems, flyovers are fine-grained "hop-based" bandwidth reservations on the level of individual autonomous systems. We demonstrate the scalability of this approach experimentally through simulations on large graphs. Moreover, we bring the flyovers\' potential to full fruition by introducing Helia, a protocol for secure flyover reservation setup and data transmission. We evaluate Helia\'s performance based on an implementation in DPDK, demonstrating authentication and forwarding of reservation traffic at 160 Gbps. Our security analysis shows that Helia can resist a large variety of powerful attacks against reservation admission and traffic forwarding. Despite its simplicity, Helia outperforms current state-of-the-art reservation systems in many key metrics.'}

They help developers easily and conveniently build cross-platform applications while just needing only one JavaScript codebase. Recent security reports showed several high-profile cross-platform applications (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Github Atom) suffered injection issues, which were often introduced by Cross-site Scripting (XSS) or embedded untrusted remote content like ads. These injections open security holes for remote web attackers, and cause serious security risks, such as allowing injected malicious code to run arbitrary local executables in victim devices (referred to as XRCE attacks). However, until now, XRCE vectors and behaviors and the root cause of XRCE were rarely studied and understood. Although the cross-platform framework developers and community responded quickly by offering multiple security features and suggestions, these mitigations were empirically proposed with unknown effectiveness.'}

	abstract = {'Popular instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Signal provide end-to-end encryption for billions of users. These applications often rely on a centralized, application-specific server to distribute public keys and relay encrypted messages between the users. As a result, they prevent passive attacks but are vulnerable to some active attacks. A malicious or hacked server can distribute fake keys to users to perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks. While typical secure messaging applications provide a manual method for users to detect these attacks, this burdens users, and studies show it is ineffective in practice. This paper presents KTACA, a completely automated approach for key verification that is oblivious to users and easy to deploy. We motivate KTACA by designing two approaches to automatic key verification. One approach uses client auditing (KTCA) and the second uses anonymous key monitoring (AKM). Both have relatively inferior security properties, leading to KTACA, which combines these approaches to provide the best of both worlds. We provide a security analysis of each defense, identifying which attacks they can automatically detect. We implement the active attacks to demonstrate they are possible, and we also create a prototype implementation of all the defenses to measure their performance and confirm their feasibility. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each defense, the load they impose on clients and service providers, and their deployment considerations.'}

	abstract = {'Sensitive numbers play an unparalleled role in identification and authentication. Recent research has revealed plenty of side-channel attacks to infer keystrokes, which require either a training phase or a dictionary to build the relationship between an observed signal disturbance and a keystroke. However, training-based methods are unpractical as the training data about the victim are hard to obtain, while dictionary-based methods cannot infer numbers, which are not combined according to linguistic rules like letters are. We observe that typing a number creates not only a number of observed disturbances in space (each corresponding to a digit), but also a sequence of periods between each disturbance. Based upon existing work that utilizes inter-keystroke timing to infer keystrokes, we build a novel technique called WINK that combines the spatial and time domain information into a spatiotemporal feature of keystroke-disturbed wireless signals. With this spatiotemporal feature, WINK can infer typed numbers without the aid of any training. Experimental results on top of software-defined radio platforms show that WINK can vastly reduce the guesses required for breaking certain 6-digit PINs from 1 million to as low as 16, and can infer over 52% of user-chosen 6-digit PINs with less than 100 attempts.'}

	abstract = {'We carry out the first in-depth characterization of residential proxies (RESIPs) in China, for which little is studied in previous works. Our study is made possible through a semantic-based classifier to automatically capture RESIP services. In addition to the classifier, new techniques have also been identified to capture RESIPs without interacting with and relaying traffic through RESIP services, which can significantly lower the cost and thus allow continuous monitoring of RESIPs. Our RESIP service classifier has achieved good performance with a recall of 99.7% and a precision of 97.6% in 10-fold cross validation. Applying the classifier has identified 399 RESIP services, a much larger set compared to 38 RESIP services collected in all previous works. Our effort of RESIP capturing leads to a collection of 9,077,278 RESIP IPs (51.36% are located in China), 96.70% of which are not covered in publicly available RESIP datasets. An extensive measurement on RESIPs and their services has uncovered a set of interesting findings as well as several security implications. Especially, 80.05% RESIP IPs located in China have sourced at least one malicious traffic flows during 2021, resulting in 52-million malicious traffic flows in total. And RESIPs have also been observed in corporation networks of 559 sensitive organizations including government agencies, education institutions and enterprises. Also, 3,232,698 China RESIP IPs have opened at least one TCP/UDP port for accepting relaying requests, which incurs non-negligible security risks to the local network of RESIPs. Besides, 91% China RESIP IPs are of a lifetime fewer than 10 days while most China RESIP services show up a crest-trough pattern in terms of the daily active RESIPs across time.'}

	abstract = {'The manifest file of an Android app is crucial for app security as it declares sensitive app configurations, such as access permissions required to access app components. Surprisingly, we noticed a number of widely-used apps (some with over 500 million downloads) containing misconfigurations in their manifest files that can result in severe security issues. This paper presents ManiScope, a tool to automatically detect misconfigurations of manifest files when given an Android APK. The key idea is to build a manifest XML Schema by extracting ManiScope constraints from the manifest documentation with novel domain-aware NLP techniques and rules, and validate manifest files against the schema to detect misconfigurations. We have implemented ManiScope, with which we have identified 609,428 (33.20%) misconfigured Android apps out of 1,853,862 apps from Google Play, and 246,658 (35.64%) misconfigured ones out of 692,106 pre-installed apps from 4,580 Samsung firmwares, respectively. Among them, 84,117 (13.80%) of misconfigured Google Play apps and 56,611 (22.95%) of misconfigured pre-installed apps have various security implications including app defrauding, message spoofing, secret data leakage, and component hijacking.'}

	abstract = {"A miniapp is a full-fledged app that is executed inside a mobile super app such as WeChat or SnapChat. Being mini by nature, it often has to communicate with other miniapps to accomplish complicated tasks. However, unlike a web app that uses network domains (i.e., IP addresses) to navigate between different web apps, a miniapp uses a unique global appId assigned by the super app to navigate between miniapps. Unfortunately, any missing checks of the sender's appId in a receiver miniapp can lead to a new type of attacks we name it cross-miniapp request forgery (CMRF). In addition to demystifying the root cause of this attack (i.e., the essence of the vulnerability), this paper also seeks to measure the popularity of this vulnerability among miniapps by developing CmrfScanner, which is able to statically detect the CMRF-vulnerability based on the abstract syntax tree of miniapp code to determine whether there are any missing checks of the appIds. We have tested CmrfScanner with 2,571,490 WeChat miniapps and 148,512 Baidu miniapps, and identified 52,394 (2.04%) WeChat miniapps and 494 (0.33%) Baidu miniapps that involve cross-communication. Among them, CmrfScanner further identified that 50,281 (95.97%) of WeChat miniapps, and 493 (99.80%) of Baidu miniapps lack the appID checks of the sender's mini-apps, indicating that a large amount of miniapp developers are not aware of this attack. We also estimated the impact of this vulnerability and found 55.05% of the lack of validation WeChat miniapps (7.09% of such Baidu miniapps) can have direct security consequences such as privileged data access, information leakage, promotion abuse, and even shopping for free. We hope that our findings can raise awareness among miniapp developers, and future miniapps will not be subject to CMRF attacks."}

	abstract = {'How much does a machine learning algorithm leak about its training data, and why? Membership inference attacks are used as an auditing tool to quantify this leakage. In this paper, we present a comprehensivehypothesis testing framework that enables us not only to formally express the prior work in a consistent way, but also to design new membership inference attacks that use reference models to achieve a significantly higher power (true positive rate) for any (false positive rate) error. More importantly, we explainwhy different attacks perform differently. We present a template for indistinguishability games, and provide an interpretation of attack success rate across different instances of the game. We discuss various uncertainties of attackers that arise from the formulation of the problem, and show how our approach tries to minimize the attack uncertainty to the one bit secret about the presence or absence of a data point in the training set. We perform adifferential analysis between all types of attacks, explain the gap between them, and show what causes data points to be vulnerable to an attack (as the reasons vary due to different granularities of memorization, from overfitting to conditional memorization). Our auditing framework is openly accessible as part of thePrivacy Meter software tool.'}

	abstract = {'Unlawful video surveillance of unsuspecting individuals using spy cameras has become an increasing concern. To mitigate these threats, there are both commercial products and research prototypes designed to detect hidden spy cameras in household and office environments. However, existing work often relies heavily on user expertise and only applies to wireless cameras. To bridge this gap, we propose HeatDeCam, a thermal-imagery-based spy camera detector, capable of detecting hidden spy cameras with or without built-in wireless connectivity. To reduce the reliance on user expertise, HeatDeCam leverages a compact neural network deployed on a smartphone to recognize unique heat dissipation patterns of spy cameras. To evaluate the proposed system, we have collected and open-sourced a dataset of a total of 22506 thermal and visual images. These images consist of 11 spy cameras collected from 6 rooms across different environmental conditions. Using this dataset, we found HeatDeCam can achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting hidden cameras. We have also conducted a usability evaluation involving a total of 416 participants using both an online survey and an in-person usability test to validate HeatDeCam.'}

We propose PACE, a generic framework that removes the bottleneck, allowing fully parallelizable ABA instances. PACE is built on RBC and reproposable ABA (RABA).

	abstract = {'Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is ubiquitous today. To prevent a BLE device (e.g., a smartphone) from being connected by unknown devices, it uses allowlisting to allow the connectivity from only recognized devices. Unfortunately, we show that this allowlist feature actually introduces a side channel for device tracking, since a device with the allowed list behaves differently even though it has used randomized MAC addresses. Worse even we also find that the current MAC address randomization scheme specified in Bluetooth protocol is flawed, suffering from a replay attack with which an attacker can replay a sniffed MAC address to probe whether a targeted device will respond or not based on its allowlist. We have validated our allowlist-based side channel attacks with 43 BLE peripheral devices, 11 centrals, and 4 development boards, and found none of them once configured with allowlisting is immune to the proposed attacks. We advocate the use of an interval unpredictable, central and peripheral synchronized random MAC address randomization scheme to defeat passive device tracking (introducing 1% power consumption overhead for centrals and 6.75% for peripherals, and 88.49 μs performance overhead for centrals and 94.46 μs for peripherals), and the use of timestamps to derive randomized MAC addresses such that attackers can no longer be able to replay them to defeat active device tracking (introducing 3.04% overhead for peripherals, and 63.58 μs and 20.54 μs performance overhead for centrals and peripherals). We have disclosed our findings to Bluetooth SIG and many other stake-holders in October 2020. Bluetooth SIG assigned CVE-2020-35473 to track this logical-level protocol flaw. Google assigned our findings as a high severity design flaw and awarded us with a bug bounty.'}

	abstract = {'The design of zkSNARKs is increasingly complicated and requires familiarity with a broad class of cryptographic and algebraic tools. This complexity in zkSNARK design also increases the difficulty in zkSNARK implementation, analysis, and optimization. To address this complexity, we develop a new workflow for designing and implementing zkSNARKs, called VOProof. In VOProof, the designer only needs to construct a Vector Oracle (VO) protocol that is intuitive and straightforward to design, and then feeds this protocol to our VO compiler to transform it into a fully functional zkSNARK. This new workflow conceals most algebraic and cryptographic operations inside the compiler, so that the designer is no longer required to understand these cumbersome and error prone procedures. Moreover, our compiler can be fine-tuned to compile one VO protocol into multiple zkSNARKs with different tradeoffs.'}

	abstract = {'Photo capturing and sharing have become routine daily activities for social platform users. Alongside the entertainment of social interaction, we are experiencing tremendous visual violation and photo abusing. Especially, users may be unconsciously filmed and exposed online, which is termed as the non-consensual sharing issue. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be well handled with proactive access control or dedicated bystander detection, as users are unaware of their situations and may be filmed stealthily. We propose Videre on behalf of the privacy of the unaware parties in a way that they would be automatically identified and warned before such photos go public. For this, we first elaborate on the predominant features encountered in non-consensual captured photos via a thorough user study. Then we establish a dataset for this context and build a classifier as a proactive detector based on multi-deep-feature fusion. To relieve the burden of person-wise unawareness detection, we further design a signature-based filter for local pre-authorization, which can also implicitly avoid classification errors. We implement and test Videre in various field settings to demonstrate its effectiveness and performance.'}

	abstract = {"This paper introduces Ibex, an advertising system that reduces the amount of data that is collected on users while still allowing advertisers to bid on real-time ad auctions and measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. Specifically, Ibex addresses an issue in recent proposals such as Google's Privacy Sandbox Topics API in which browsers send information about topics that are of interest to a user to advertisers and demand-side platforms (DSPs). DSPs use this information to (1) determine how much to bid on the auction for a user who is interested in particular topics, and (2) measure how well their ad campaign does for a given audience (i.e., measure conversions). While Topics and related proposals reduce the amount of user information that is exposed, they still reveal user preferences. In Ibex, browsers send user information in an encrypted form that still allows DSPs and advertisers to measure conversions, compute aggregate statistics such as histograms about users and their interests, and obliviously bid on auctions without learning for whom they are bidding. Our implementation of Ibex shows that creating histograms is 1.-2.5× more expensive for browsers than disclosing user information, and Ibex's oblivious bidding protocol can finish auctions within 550 ms. We think this makes Ibex capable of preserving a good experience while improving user privacy."}

	abstract = {'To prevent unauthorized apps from retrieving the sensitive data, Android framework enforces a permission based access control. However, it has long been known that, to bypass the access control, unauthorized apps can intercept the Intent objects which are sent by authorized apps and carry the retrieved sensitive data. We find that there is a new (previously unknown) attack surface in Android framework that can be exploited by unauthorized apps to violate the access control. Specifically, we discover that part of Intent objects that are sent by Android framework and carry sensitive data can be received by unauthorized apps, resulting in the leak of sensitive data. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation on the new attack surface namely the Intent based leak of sensitive data in Android framework. To automatically uncover such kind of vulnerability in Android framework, we design and develop a new tool named LeakDetector, which finds the Intent objects sent by Android framework that can be received by unauthorized apps and carry the sensitive data. Applying LeakDetector to 10 commercial Android systems, we find that it can effectively uncover the Intent based leak of sensitive data in Android framework. Specifically, we discover 36 exploitable cases of such kind of data leak, which can be abused by unauthorized apps to steal the sensitive data, violating the access control. At the time of writing, 16 of them have been confirmed by Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi, and we received bug bounty rewards from these mobile vendors.'}

	abstract = {'Security bugs like memory errors are constantly introduced to software programs, and recent years have witnessed an increasing number of reported security bugs. Traditional detection approaches are mainly specification-based---detecting violations against a specified rule as security bugs. This often does not work well in practice because specifications are difficult to specify and generalize, leaving complicated and new types of bugs undetected. Recent research thus leans toward deviation-based detection which finds a substantial number of similar cases and detects deviating cases as potential bugs. This, however, suffers from two other problems. First, it requires enough similar cases to find deviations and thus cannot work for custom code that does not have similar cases. Second, code-similarity analysis is probabilistic and challenging, so the detection can be unreliable. Sometimes, similar cases can normally have deviating behaviors under different contexts.'}

	abstract = {'Emulating firmware of microcontrollers is challenging due to the lack of peripheral models. Existing work finds out how to respond to peripheral read operations by analyzing the target firmware. This is problematic because the firmware sometimes does not contain enough clues to support the emulation or even contains misleading information (e.g., a buggy firmware). In this work, we propose a new approach that builds peripheral models from the peripheral specification. Using NLP, we translate peripheral behaviors in human language (documented in chip manuals) into a set of structured condition-action rules. By checking, executing, and chaining them at run time, we can dynamically synthesize a peripheral model for each firmware execution. The extracted condition-action rules might not be complete or even be wrong. We, therefore, propose incorporating symbolic execution to quickly pinpoint the root cause. This assists us in the manual correction of the problematic rules. We have implemented our idea for five popular MCU boards spanning three different chip vendors. Using a new edit-distance-based algorithm to calculate trace differences, our evaluation against a large firmware corpus confirmed that our prototype achieves much higher fidelity compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Benefiting from the accurate emulation, our emulator effectively avoids false positives observed in existing fuzzing work. We also designed a new dynamic analysis method to perform driver code compliance checks against the specification. We found some non-compliance which we later confirmed to be bugs caused by race conditions.'}

	abstract = {'Mobile-as-a-Gateway (MaaG) is a popular feature using mobile devices as gateways to connect IoT devices to cloud services for management. MaaG IoT access control systems support remote access sharing/revocation while allowing "offline availability\'\' for better usability. Realizing these functionalities requires secure cooperation among the cloud service, the companion app, and the IoT device. For practical considerations, we find that almost all cloud services perform access model translation (AMT) to translate expressive cloud-side access policies to simple device-side policies. During the process, ad-hoc protocols are developed to support the access policy synchronization. Unfortunately, current MaaG IoT systems fail to recognize the security risks in the process of access model translation and synchronization. We analyze ten top-of-the-line MaaG IoT devices and find that all of them have serious vulnerabilities, e.g., allowing irrevocable and permanent access for temporary users. We further propose a secure protocol design that defends against all identified attacks.'}

	abstract = {'Neural networks provide state-of-the-art results in many domains. Yet, they often require high energy and time-consuming training processes. Therefore, the research community is exploring alternative, energy-efficient approaches likespiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs mimic brain neurons by encoding data into sparse spikes, resulting in energy-efficient computing. To exploit the properties of the SNNs, they can be trained with neuromorphic datasets that capture the differences in motion. SNNs, just like any neural network model, can be susceptible to security threats that make the model perform anomalously. One of the most crucial threats is the backdoor attacks that modify the training set to inject a trigger in some samples. After training, the neural network will perform correctly on the main task. However, under the presence of the trigger (backdoor) on an input sample, the attacker can control its behavior. The existing works on backdoor attacks consider standard datasets and not neuromorphic ones. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first backdoor attacks on neuromorphic datasets. Due to the structure of neuromorphic datasets, we utilize two different triggers, i.e., static andmoving triggers. We then evaluate the performance of our backdoor using spiking neural networks, achieving top accuracy on both main and backdoor tasks, up to 99%.'}

	abstract = {"In this paper, we revisit the problem of secure shuffling in a three-server setting with an honest majority. We begin with the recent work of Araki. et al. (CCS'21) and use precomputation to improve the communication and round complexity of the online phase of their shuffle protocol. Our simple yet effective shuffling method is not limited to three parties and can be used in a variety of situations. Furthermore, the design of our solution allows for fine tuning to achieve improved efficiency based on the underlying application's parameters. Our protocols are initially presented with semi-honest security and then extended to support malicious corruption."}

In particular, CapSpeaker silently delivers voice commands to voice-controllable systems using inaudible acoustic noise and intermodulation distortion (IMD). Silicon capacitor is an emerging technology that achieves a larger capacitance with a smaller footprint fabricated with semiconductor manufacturing processes using different structures and materials. Do silicon capacitors still generate acoustic noise despite the differences?

However, due to the lack of system-level support, obtaining strong guarantees of policy enforcement is hard, leaving the door open for software bugs and vulnerabilities to cause GDPR-compliance violations. We present ongoing work on building a GDPR-aware personal data policy compliance system for web development frameworks. Currently prototyped for the MERN framework, our system allows web developers to specify a GDPR manifest from which the data protection policy of the web application is automatically generated and is transparently enforced through static code analysis and runtime access control mechanisms. GDPR compliance is checked in a cross-cutting manner requiring few changes to the application code. We evaluate our prototype with four real-world applications. Our system can model realistic GDPR data protection requirements, adds modest performance overheads to the web application, and can detect GDPR violation bugs.'}

	abstract = {'Cryptography and Machine Learning are two computational science fields that intuitively seem related. Privacy-preserving machine learning-either utilizing encrypted models or learning over encrypted data-is an exploding field thanks to the maturation of primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. However there has been surprisingly little work on applying recent advances in machine learning to the task of cryptanalysis, the branch of cryptography that studies how cryptographic ciphers can be attacked. In particular, while a cryptographic cipher seeks to keep certain information secret by making it appear random, discerning patterns and structure from random data is a common machine learning task. This paper proposes EveGAN, an approach that treats cryptanalysis as a language translation problem. While treating cipher cracking as a language translation problem has been validated against a handful of classical substitution ciphers, the EveGAN approach builds on these results to create a new class of generative deep learning-based cryptanalysis attacks.'}

	abstract = {"Contemporary home control systems determine real-time heating/cooling demands utilizing smart sensor devices, giving rise to demand control heating, ventilation, and cooling (DCHVAC) systems, thus improving the home's energy efficiency. The adoption of activity monitoring in the smart home control system further augments the controller efficiency and improves occupants' comfort and productivity, elderly monitoring, and so forth. Additionally, the learned occupants' activity patterns help embed machine learning (ML)-based abnormality detection capability to track inconsistencies among the zone sensor measurements. Hence, the incorporation of an activity monitoring system assists anomaly detection models (ADMs) in detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks that are being glowingly researched due to their massive damage capability. However, in this work, we propose a novel attack strategy that identified that the knowledge of occupants' activities along with indoor air quality (IAQ) and occupancy sensor measurements allows the attackers to launch even more hazardous attack (i.e., significant increment in energy cost/ worsening health conditions for the occupants). Hence, it is crucial to analyze the security of the activity monitoring-based smart home DCHVAC system. Accordingly, we propose a novel formal threat analyzer that analyzes the threat space of the smart home DCHVAC control system, which is modeled by rule-based control policies and ML-based ADMs. The rules from the ADM are extracted through an efficient algorithm. The constraints associated with the rules are solved through a satisfiability module theorem (SMT)-based solver. %We performed our initial evaluation of the proposed threat analyzer's effectiveness on the Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS) dataset using some metrics. We will further experiment with other metrics along experimenting with our collaborator's dataset (KTH live-in lab) and open-source Örebro datasets for assessing the framework with realistic occupants' activity. Moreover, we also created our prototype testbed for evaluating the feasibility of the proposed attack and threat analyzer."}

In this work we show that the cryptographic agility in DNSSEC, although critical for provisioning DNS with strong cryptography, also introduces a vulnerability. We find that under certain conditions, when new algorithms are listed in signed DNS responses, the resolvers do not validate DNSSEC. As a result, domains that deploy new ciphers may in fact cause the resolvers not to validate DNSSEC. We exploit this to develop DNSSEC-downgrade attacks and experimentally and ethically evaluate them against popular DNS resolver implementations, public DNS providers, and DNS services used by web clients worldwide. We find that major DNS providers as well as 45% of DNS resolvers used by web clients are vulnerable to our attacks.'}

First, MSILDiffer directly extracts MSIL instructions from the .NET assemblies, and retrieves the hierarchy of classes as well as their internal class methods. Then, with coarse and fine granularity feature extraction and comparison, MSILDiffer quickly filters out the code with substantial changes after patch. Besides, we build a dataset of patch analysis containing 24.46 million class methods based on the Microsoft Exchange mail system security patches. With the assistance of MSILDiffer, we generated 32 call paths and crafted corresponding POCs for 1-day vulnerabilities in the dataset. Through the experiment evaluation, MSILDiffer is superior to JustAssembly in terms of coverage, accuracy and time consumption of patch difference analysis.'}

In various application scenarios, data-aggregation servers are interested in learning τ-heavy hitters. To ensure that the servers do not learn anything about client input in the process, the problem of identifying heavy hitters privately is gaining popularity. Towards this, we design a novel system called Vogue, which provides improved efficiency as well as security guarantees over the state-of-the-art system of Poplar. Concretely, Vogue provides up to 27x efficiency improvement over Poplar when considering 400,000 clients who hold 256-bit input strings. Moreover, Vogue overcomes intermediate information leakages present in Poplar and guarantees full security in the presence of a malicious adversary. In the process of designing Vogue, we also design secure and efficient protocols for stable compaction and shuffle, each of which improves over its respective state-of-the-art.'}

A class of such protocols that is particularly popular are leader-based protocols, where one server (the leader) is tasked with proposing and broadcasting blocks of new data to be applied to the state machine. Simple implementation of the broadcast requires the leader to send entire blocks to all other servers, creating a network bottleneck at the leader and reducing the system throughput as the number of servers scales. We demonstrate this effect by benchmarking HotStuff, a popular leader-based protocol, and then propose a mitigation based on coding. The key idea is to let the leader encode the block into small chunks, and task each server with broadcasting a chunk, thus utilizing the bandwidth of all servers during the process. We apply this idea on HotStuff, and demonstrate a 64% improvement in throughput in a deployment across 9 servers.'}

Recently, Tekiner et al. [1] proposed an effective cryptojacking detection technique using a machine learning model with the statistical properties of the network traffic for cryptojacking in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that this state-of-the-art method can effectively be evaded by maliciously manipulating the network packets for cryptojacking. Our evaluation results show that packet manipulations (packet splitting, dummy packet/payload insertion, and a proxy network) can effectively evade the model's detection -- the packet splitting technique significantly decreased the F1-score of the detection model from 0.93 to 0.30. Finally, the best combination of those packet manipulations can decrease the F1-score of the detection model to 0.21."}

	abstract = {'Deep neural network (DNN) services have been widely deployed in many different domains. For instance, a client may send its private input data (e.g., images, texts and videos) to the cloud for accurate inferences with pre-trained DNN models. However, significant privacy concerns would emerge in such applications due to the potential data or model sharing. Secure inferences with cryptographic techniques have been proposed to address such issues, and the system can perform secure two-party inferences between each client and cloud. However, most of existing cryptographic systems only focus on DNNs for extracting 2D features for image inferences, which have major limitations on latency and scalability for extracting spatio-temporal (3D) features from videos for accurate inferences. To address such critical deficiencies, we design and implement the first cryptographic inference system, Crypto3D, which privately infers videos on 3D features with rigorous privacy guarantees. We evaluate Crypto3D and benchmark with the state-of-the-art systems on privately inferring videos in the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets with C3D and I3D models. Our results demonstrate that Crypto3D significantly outperforms existing systems (substantially extended to inferences with 3D features): execution time: 186.89x vs. CryptoDL (3D), 63.75x vs. HEANN (3D), 61.52x vs. MP-SPDZ (3D), 45x vs. E2DM (3D), 3.74x vs. Intel SGX (3D), and 3x vs. Gazelle (3D); accuracy: 82.3% vs. below 70% for all of them.'}

	abstract = {"Tor is the most popular anonymity network in the world. It relies on advanced security and obfuscation techniques to ensure the privacy of its users and free access to the Internet. However, the investigation of traffic correlation attacks against Tor Onion Services (OSes) has been relatively overlooked in the literature. In particular, determining whether it is possible to emulate a global passive adversary capable of deanonymizing the IP addresses of both the Tor OSes and of the clients accessing them has remained, so far, an open question. In this paper, we present ongoing work toward addressing this question and reveal some preliminary results on a scalable traffic correlation attack that can potentially be used to deanonymize Tor OS sessions. Our attack is based on a distributed architecture involving a group of colluding ISPs from across the world. After collecting Tor traffic samples at multiple vantage points, ISPs can run them through a pipeline where several stages of traffic classifiers employ complementary techniques that result in the deanonymization of OS sessions with high confidence (i.e., low false positives). We have responsibly disclosed our early results with the Tor Project team and are currently working not only on improving the effectiveness of our attack but also on developing countermeasures to preserve Tor users' privacy."}

Under a low CPU load, the function execution time distribution follows the Pareto distribution. However, the function execution time distribution no longer follows the Pareto distribution when the CPU load is high, and the CPU clock fingerprint becomes invalid. In view of this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive Pareto principle that adaptively adjusts the distribution according to the CPU load. Based on this, the robust CPU Clock Fingerprint Model based on the Adaptive Pareto Principle (CFMAP) is proposed. Via a KNN-based fingerprint recognition method, CFMAP solves the instability of existing CPU clock fingerprints under a high CPU load. Experiments show that the average recognition rate of CFMAP fingerprints is 96.82%. Moreover, they are highly robust against CPU load attacks and virtual machine attacks.'}

To this extent, a variety of MTDs have been proposed for specific aspects of a system. However, deploying MTDs at different layers/components of the Cloud and assessing their effects on the overall security gains for the entire system is still challenging since the Cloud is a complex system entailing physical and virtual resources, and there exists a multitude of attack surfaces that an attacker can target. Thus, we explore the combination of MTDs, and their deployment at different components (belonging to various operational layers) to maximize the security gains offered by the MTDs.We also propose a quantification mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the MTDs against the attacks in the Cloud."}

Furthermore, these techniques assume that the interconnection among the assets is static. However, in the Cloud, resources can instantiate or migrate across physical hosts at run-time, thus making the Cloud a dynamic environment. Additionally, the number of attacks targeting multiple assets/layers emphasizes the need for threat analysis approaches developed for Cloud environments. Therefore, this proposal presents a novel threat analysis approach that specifically addresses multi-layer attacks. The proposed approach facilitates threat analysis by developing a technology-agnostic information flow model. It contributes to exploring a threat's propagation across the operational stack of the Cloud and, consequently, holistically assessing the security of the Cloud."}

Border routers use this information to check which Autonomous Systems (ASes) are authorized to originate given prefixes and to enforce Route Origin Validation (ROV) in order to block bogus BGP announcements, preventing accidental and malicious prefix hijacks. In 2021 the RPKI relying party implementations were patched against attacks by malicious publication points. In such attacks the relying parties are stalled processing malformed RPKI objects. In this work we perform a black-box analysis of the patched relying party implementations and find that out of five popular relying parties, two major implementations (Routinator and OctoRPKI) have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to cause large scale blackouts in the RPKI ecosystem. We show that the vulnerabilities we found apply to 84.9% of the networks supporting RPKI. We analyze the code to understand the factors causing the bugs. We show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to crash the deployed relying parties, disabling RPKI validation and exposing the networks to prefix hijack attacks.'}

	abstract = {"Smart Grid (SG) networks, as a part of critical national infrastructure, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks. Specifically, a coordinated false data injection attack aiming to generate fake transient measurements in the SG's Automatic Generation Control (AGC), can cause unwarranted actions and blackouts in the worst scenario. Unlike other works that overlook contextual correlations, this work utilizes contextual prior information and a temporal model to detect cyber-attacks. Specifically, we depart from the traditional deep learning anomaly detection, driven by black-box detection; instead, we envision an approach based on physics-informed hybrid deep learning detection. Our approach utilizes the combination of process control-based variational autoencoder, prior knowledge of physics, and long short-term memory for a false data injection attack detection. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first contextual-based anomaly detection that incorporates process control-based prior information in the smart grid. The proposed approach is evaluated on the modified high-class PowerWorld simulated dataset based on the IEEE 37-bus model. Our experiments observe the lowest reconstruction error and offer 96.9% accuracy, demonstrating superiority over other baselines."}

The goal of obfuscation is to retain the semantics of the text (i.e., the meaning) but rewrite it in such a way that the author cannot be identified. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of language models for authorship obfuscation. More specifically, we examine the application of document summarization (a task where we learn to generate the summary of a text) as an authorship obfuscation method. Since summaries are shorter versions of text but which retain the significant points made in it, we hypothesize that summaries will be stripped off any stylistic identifying features of the text. Our experiments show that this is indeed the case; we were able to fool authorship classifiers and degrade their performance by as much as 70% However, this also significantly affected the semantics; there was a non-trivial loss of information and the produced text was not an accurate representation of the original.'}

	abstract = {'MagNet is a defense method that adopts autoencoders to detect and purify adversarial examples. Although MagNet is robust against grey-box and black-box attacks, it is vulnerable to white-box attacks. Despite this prior knowledge, the fundamental reason for and mitigation of the vulnerability of MagNet have not been discussed. We suggest that the challenge of MagNet is the generalization of the data manifold. To explain this, in this work, we leverage deep learning coverage for the reformer of MagNet. We mutate training images through image transformation algorithms and then train the reformer using mutants with new coverage information. The selected mutants provide an interesting data manifold, that cannot be handled by the random noise of MagNet, to the reformer. In grey-box settings, our defense method classified adversarial examples for various perturbation sizes much more accurately than MagNet even with the same architecture. Based on the preliminary result of this work, we consider future work to identify whether the generalization power of deep learning coverage is effective for stronger adversaries and different architectures.'}

Specifically, we leverage multiple antennas on WiFi devices to estimate the two-dimensional angle of arrival (2D AoA) of the WiFi signal reflections to enable WiFi devices to "see\'\' a person. We then utilize deep learning techniques to extract a 3D mesh representation of a person and extract the body shape and walking patterns for person Re-ID.

	abstract = {'Session-replay bots are believed to be the latest and most advanced generation of web-bots, that are also difficult challenging to defend against. Combating session-replay bots is particularly problematic in online domains that get repeatedly visited by the same genuine human user(s), and possibly in the same/similar way - such as news, banking or gaming sites. Namely, in such domains, it is difficult to determine whether two look-alike sessions are produced by the same human user or these sessions are just bot-generated session replays. In this paper we introduce and provide to the public a novel real-world mouse dynamics dataset named ReMouse. ReMouse dataset is collected in a guided environment and, unlike other publicly available mouse dynamics dataset, it contains repeat-sessions generated by the same human user(s). As such, ReMouse dataset is first of its kind and is of particular relevance for studies on the development of effective defenses against session-replay bots. Our own statistical analysis of ReMouse dataset shows that not only two different human users are highly unlikely to generate same/similar looking sessions when performing the same/similar online task, but even the (repeat) sessions generated by the same human user are likely to be sufficiently distinguishable from one another.'}

	abstract = {'The number of real-time embedded devices is increasing, especially in critical places such as industrial and medical devices. These devices are the target of many security attacks; therefore, their security must be ensured, and existing vulnerabilities must be fixed immediately. Typical update approaches require rebooting or halting the devices for an unpredictable time, and are hence not applicable for real-time embedded devices such as medical devices, which must run continuously without rebooting. Hotpatching, which patches the code without rebooting the device, has been used in this context. However, existing hotpatching methods require manual effort from programmers that is error-prone and time-consuming. Further, little attention has been paid to these techniques for real-time embedded devices. This paper proposes AutoPatch, the first automatic hotpatching approach for real-time embedded devices. AutoPatch automatically analyzes the official patch to extract its semantics using predicate abstraction, and generates a semantically equivalent patch called hotpatch. Our initial results show that AutoPatch can automatically generate hotpatches correctly based on the official patches (i.e., real-world CVEs) using program analysis. We also validate that the generated hotpatch can fix the vulnerabilities without rebooting or halting the devices.'}

The recent rapid deployment of autonomous driving (AD) has highly benefited from the advancement of LiDARs. At the same time, the safety-critical application strongly motivates its security research. Recent studies demonstrate that they can manipulate the LiDAR point cloud and fool object detection by shooting malicious lasers against LiDAR scanning. However, prior efforts focus on limited types of LiDARs and object detection models, and their threat models are not clearly validated in the real world. To fill the critical research gap, we plan to conduct the first large-scale measurement study on LiDAR spoofing attacks against a wide variety of LiDARs with major object detectors. To perform this measurement, we first significantly improved the LiDAR spoofing capability (30x more spoofing points than the prior attack) with more careful optics and functional electronics, which allows us to be the first to clearly demonstrate and quantify key attack capabilities assumed in prior works. In this poster, we present our preliminary results on VLP-16 and our research plan.'}

We perform control-plane and data-plane experiments and provide an in-depth analysis of the collected results. Our analysis is based on new methodologies we developed that allow more accurate identification of ROV enforcing ASes. Our analysis shows that the current ROV enforcement rate is significantly higher than found in previous studies: in contrast to 0.6% in a study from 2021, in our work we find that 37.8% enforce ROV.

	abstract = {"To save costs residential routers often do not implement most of the functionalities and security features of DNS, yet they still contain DNS forwarders which merely proxy the clients' requests to another address. These forwarders separate the network configuration of the internal client network from the network of the ISP. This provides connectivity without the need for synchronization. History of cache poisoning attacks shows however that such simplified implementations expose a wide range of vulnerabilities. We propose to remove DNS from routers. We show that the performance impact is negligible, while security gain is substantial. We discuss a number of ways for implementing our approach"}

Since genetic data is extremely sensitive and long-lived, individuals and organizations are reluctant to share their data for analysis. This paper proposes two solutions for a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving system for performing minor allele frequency analysis on multiple data sets. Homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs are used in combination with a blockchain system to achieve data privacy and enable verifiability. Preliminary evaluation of the solutions reveals several important challenges such as handling large cipher texts in smart contracts and reuse of the encrypted data for specific researcher queries that need to be tackled in order to make the solutions more practical.'}

Among different attacks on AD perception, object-hiding adversarial attack is one of the most critical ones due to the direct impact on safety-critical driving decisions such as collision avoidance. However, all of the prior works on physical object-hiding adversarial attacks only study the security of the AI component alone rather than with the entire AD system pipeline with closed-loop control. This thus inevitably raises a critical research question: can these prior works actually achieve system-level effects (e.g., vehicle collisions, traffic rule violation) under real-world AD settings with closed-loop control?'}

	abstract = {'As transaction fees skyrocket today, blockchains become increasingly expensive, hurting their adoption in broader applications. This work tackles the saving of transaction fees for economic blockchain applications. The key insight is that other than the existing "default\'\' mode to execute application logic fully on-chain, i.e., in smart contracts, and in fine granularity, i.e., user request per transaction, there are alternative execution modes with advantages in cost-effectiveness. On Ethereum, we propose a holistic middleware platform supporting flexible and secure transaction executions, including off-chain states and batching of user requests. Furthermore, we propose control-plane schemes to adapt the execution mode to the current workload for optimal runtime cost. We present a case study on the institutional accounts (e.g., coinbase.com) intensively sending Ether on Ethereum blockchains. By collecting real-life transactions, we construct workload benchmarks and show that our work saves 18%\\sim 47%18%-47% per invocation than the default baseline while introducing 1.81%\\sim 16.59%1.81%-16.59% blocks delay.'}

	abstract = {'Ear wearables (earables) have become an emerging and wide acceptable platform for various applications. Because of the limited input interface of earables, traditional authentication methods become less desired. However, the feature-rich sensing abilities of earables and the unique human face-ear channel bring us new sensing opportunities to reutilize fingerprints. In this work, we proposed SlidePass, a secure earables authentication system that leverages the finger-face acoustic friction produced by sliding finger gestures on the face. In particular, our system leverages the inward-facing microphone of the earables to reliably capture the acoustic of finger-face frictions. The core insight of our system is to utilize the face as a natural scanner for finger-face friction and earables to capture and reconstruct the fingerprint features. SlidePass is specially designed for earables. Due to the finger-face friction captured and encrypted by the face channel that is unique and hidden in the human skull, SlidePass is more resistant to various spoofing attacks. Our preliminary evaluation included ten different fingerprints showing that SlidePass achieves an average accuracy of 94%.'}

	abstract = {'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive results in various graph learning tasks. They have found their way into many applications, such as fraud detection, molecular property prediction, or knowledge graph reasoning. However, GNNs have been recently demonstrated to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. In this work, we explore a new kind of backdoor attack, i.e., a clean-label backdoor attack, on GNNs. Unlike prior backdoor attacks on GNNs in which the adversary can introduce arbitrary, often clearly mislabeled, inputs to the training set, in a clean-label backdoor attack, the resulting poisoned inputs appear to be consistent with their label and thus are less likely to be filtered as outliers. The initial experimental results illustrate that the adversary can achieve a high attack success rate (up to 98.47%) with a clean-label backdoor attack on GNNs for the graph classification task. We hope our work will raise awareness of this attack and inspire novel defenses against it.'}

	abstract = {'Blockchain sharding protocols randomly distribute nodes to different shards. They limit the quantity of shards to ensure that the adversary remains a minority inside each shard with a high probability. There can exist only a small number of shards. In this article, we propose a new sharding protocol that links the number of shards with the adversary population in real-time instead of a fixed upper-bounded population. The protocol is a two-phase design. First, several committee shards are constructed where the majority of nodes inside each are honest with high probability; then, each committee shard randomly splits into several worker shards with a high likelihood that at least one honest node is inside each. Each worker shard handles different transactions. Worker shard blocks that did not pass the unanimous voting are collected and voted by the committee shard using the majority voting. We show that (1) in the worst case (extremely unlikely) when all the transactions need to be handled by the committee shards, the transaction throughput and the data requirement only deteriorate to the same level as classical sharded blockchain; (2) when the worker shards handle most transactions, the overall transaction throughput is zoomed by two magnitudes securely while the data requirement for nodes remains at the same level.'}

In this paper, we propose a new sensor fuzzing framework SensorFuzz that can systematically discover potential sensor spoofing attacks on robotic vehicles.

Moreover, it supports users in defining their customized matching rules using their vulnerability mining experience, which makes this approach more flexible and scalable.

While a lot of attention has been paid to improving swarm control algorithms for improved intelligence, the security implications of various design choices in swarm control algorithms have not been studied. We highlight how an attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities in swarm control algorithms to disrupt drone swarms. Specifically, we show that the attacker can target one swarm member (target drone) through sensor spoofing attacks, and indirectly cause other swarm members (victim drones) to veer off from their course, and potentially resulting in a crash. Our attack cannot be prevented by traditional software security techniques, and it is stealthy in nature as it causes seemingly benign deviations in drone swarms. Our initial results show that spoofing the position of a target drone by 5m is sufficient to cause other drones to crash into a front obstacle. Overall, our attack achieves 76.67% and 93.33% success rate with 5m and 10m spoofing deviation respectively.'}

	abstract = {'Training machine learning algorithms on sensitive, illegal to possess, and psychologically harmful data is challenging because researchers have to do training without handling the data. Moreover, the nature of the data imposes strict control, monitoring, and examination of all the activities involved, including communication, execution, and release of algorithms, datasets, outputs, and results. In this regard, this work proposes a new multi-zoned framework called MaLFraDA. MaLFraDA has soft air gaps between its zones to isolate and control communication in and out of the framework. Besides, it includes (i) a vetter to investigate and approve incoming model/algorithm, and outgoing information, (ii) encrypted data vaults, and (iii) airlock instances for secure execution/computation. MaLFraDA, with an extension, runs popular distributed machine learning algorithms such as federated and split learning using multiple data custodians.'}

	abstract = {'COVID-19 has altered the landscape of medical record issuing and verification. Multiple challenges have arisen in this new era as individuals are now required to prove their health status for traveling, working, or simply eating at a restaurant. Record verification across country borders is particularly hard to achieve as it requires collaboration at an international level, sharing potentially sensitive medical data. In this work, we propose VaxPass, a scalable system for COVID-19 record issuing and verification that facilitates this collaboration with minimal data leakage. At the core of our design lies a 2-tier blockchain architecture that allows individual issuing authorities to maintain their own 1st -level blockchain and only upload a small digest of their records, periodically, on the 2nd -level. Crucially, a verifier can check the validity of a certificate without having access to the 1st -level blockchain where the records actually reside. Our system also includes a mobile application and a web client. As we demonstrate, its performance scales well with the number of participants, making this the first solution able to support real-life inspired needs for such a system, while maintaining confidentiality of the medical data solely to privy entities.'}

At the same time, its scalability remains the Achilles' heel of distributed systems. A number of ongoing R&D efforts aim at scaling blockchain networks up to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Yet even such performance targets can be seen as modest when the goal is to bring traditional web workloads to the decentralised web (Web3), requiring the handling of billions of transactions per second, large volumes of data, complex workloads and applications, and hard latency requirements. The goal of this workshop is to foster scientific exchange across a wider community in consensus research and adjacent fields, by disseminating and providing a forum for discussion of upcoming impactful research with a practical twist."}

Besides mainstream research, ASHES puts some focus on new and emerging scenarios: This includes the Internet of Things (IoT), nuclear weapons inspections, arms control, consumer and infrastructure security, or supply chain security, among others. ASHES also welcomes dedicated works on special purpose hardware, such as lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, or non-electronic security systems. The workshop hosts four different paper categories: Apart from regular and short papers, this includes works that systematize and structure a certain (sub-)area (so-called "Systematization of Knowledge" (SoK) papers), and so-termed "Wild-and-Crazy" (WaC) papers, which distribute seminal ideas at an early conceptual stage. This summary gives a brief overview of the sixth edition of the workshop, which took place virtually on November 11, 2022 in Los Angeles, California, USA, as a post-conference satellite workshop of ACM CCS.'}

The analytic tools and intelligent behavior provided by these techniques make AI and ML increasingly important for autonomous real-time analysis and decision making in domains with a wealth of data or that require quick reactions to constantly changing situations. The use of learning methods in security-sensitive domains, in which adversaries may attempt to mislead or evade intelligent machines, creates new frontiers for security research. The recent widespread adoption of "deep learning" techniques, whose security properties are difficult to reason about directly, has only added to the importance of this research. In addition, data mining and machine learning techniques create a wealth of privacy issues, due to the abundance and accessibility of data. The AISec workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and machine learning.'}

The new domain of Additive Manufacturing (a.k.a. 3D Printing) Security requires novel solutions to its unique security concerns. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners working in this highly inter-disciplinary research field and closely related areas.'}

While DeFi systems are gaining significant traction (e.g., they already manage tens of billions of dollars worth of assets), making them secure has proven exceptionally challenging---a staggering $1.9 billion was stolen in various hacks in the first seven months of 2022 alone.[4]'}
