	abstract = {Frequently happening of disk failures seriously affects the dependability and service quality of cloud data centers. Recently, machine learning (ML) based methods are popularly adopted to proactively predict forthcoming disk failures via supervised learning. However, the high imbalance of failure samples and healthy samples is a huge obstacle for existing detection methods to establish high performance detection model. This paper presents a data augmentation method MSGMD, which can efficiently generate high quality failure samples to alleviate the data imbalance of the training set, so as to effectively improve the performance of any supervised failure detection models. First, MSGMD converts failure samples (multivariate time series) into multiple univariate time series via decomposing the spatial relations among features. Then it learns the temporal correlation of each feature via a policy-based reinforcement learning model trained in an adversarial way. After that, it generates failure samples by combining feature series sampled from learned distribution. Finally, it filters out low quality generated samples with a confidence-based method. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, through data augmentation, MSGMD can improve the FDR and F1-Score of the state-of-the-art disk failure detection model by 31.59% and 30.74% respectively on average.}

	abstract = {Task graphs are widely used to represent data-intensive applications. To efficiently execute these applications on heterogeneous systems, each task must be properly scheduled on the processors of the system. The NP-completeness of the task scheduling problem has motivated researchers to propose various heuristic methods. Recently, Quality of Service (QoS) aware scheduling is becoming an active research area in heterogeneous systems because the end-user has different QoS requirements. Generally, time and cost are the most relevant user concerns. However, it is challenging to find a feasible scheduling plan which minimizes the total execution time of the user’s application (makespan) while satisfying both budget and deadline constraints. In this paper, we present a novel heuristic algorithm called Budget-Deadline-Aware-Scheduling (BUDA) that addresses task graphs scheduling under budget and deadline constraints in heterogeneous systems. The novelty of the BUDA algorithm is based on a Heterogeneous Time-Cost Matrix (HTCM) that is used to prioritize tasks and for processor selection. In addition, we introduce a new Heterogeneous Time-Cost Trade-off factor (HTCT) that tries to adjust the time and cost for the current task among all processors. The experiments based on randomly generated graphs and real-world applications graphs show that the BUDA algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of makespan, time efficiency, and success rate.}

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of demands for mobile traffic, while the traditional mobile traffic pricing schemes cannot accommodate such demands. Sponsored data plan (SDP), which can increase the revenue of all stakeholders in the market through transferring some of the revenue from content providers (CPs) to end users (EUs), is more suitable. However, existing studies have focused more on Internet service providers (ISPs) and CPs, ignoring the influence of EUs (e.g., the inherent attribute differences of EUs and the interaction among EUs) on the market under SDP. Regarding the difficulty of modeling the abstract property about interaction among EUs, we utilize network congestion as the medium and construct the congestion-aware SDP model based on Stackelberg game. The newly proposed model can not only analyze how network congestion affects SDP mechanism, but also elucidate the impact of interactions among EUs. More specifically, through theoretical analysis, we prove that there is a unique dynamic equilibrium in the interaction among EUs (i.e., the traffic consumption of different EUs). By taking into account network congestion, the newly proposed model also more accurately and realistically describes the optimal strategies and computation methods of all stakeholders in the market. Moreover, simulation experiments demonstrate that the positive effect brought by SDP is not as obvious as before, and EUs influence each other instead of being independent of each other. Overall, this paper emphasizes the non-negligible influence of EUs and promotes a deeper understanding of SDP mechanism, which can guide the relevant stakeholders to optimize their own decision-making details.}

	abstract = {The explosive growth of global distributed services has led to a massive increase in bulk multicast data transfers over the inter-datacenter Wide-Area Network. While many solutions have been proposed to improve the performance of inter-DC bulk data transfers, they are insufficient to optimize multicast transfers because they fail to explore the characteristics of multicast transfers and network topology. This paper presents FlexCast, a flexible and efficient solution to optimize the completion times for multicast transfers. FlexCast takes advantage of topological characteristics to divide network sites into groups, partition receivers into subsets, and construct load-adaptive Steiner trees for receiver partitions to reduce completion time. It also employs a flexible multicast model for parallel transmission. For better performance FlexCast uses multiple scheduling policies to handle offline request submission, and for greater efficiency it adopts a combination of small-scale optimization and fast heuristic to address online request submission quickly. Simulations on real-world topologies show that FlexCast improves the completion time for multicast receivers by up to 80% compared to prior solutions.}

	abstract = {Massive enterprises deploy their applications on public clouds to relieve infrastructure management burden. However, applications are faced with highly fluctuating workloads, while clouds provision exclusive resources at coarse time granularity, resulting in severely low resource efficiency. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform enables fine-grained resource multiplexing, which has the potential to improve efficiency. However, FaaS platforms could consume several seconds to start functions and the long startup latency can severely hurt the performance of applications. In this paper, we measure the FaaS platforms and find that most startup latency is occupied by code preparation. To reduce the code preparation latency with little resource overhead, we propose Scorpius, a FaaS platform that proactively prepares code based on the historical data of functions. It combines two optimization categories: (1) To reduce the code size, Scorpius proposes to proactively prepare partial libraries over servers and run functions on the server with most library sharing. (2) To advance the start time, Scorpius proposes to predict the function overload with a simple model and proactively scale code to more servers. We have implemented a prototype of Scorpius and conducted extensive experiments. Evaluation results demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art methods, Scorpius can reduce the code preparation latency by 87.6% with only 9.3% storage overhead.}

	abstract = {Edge computing servers (ECSs) have been widely deployed in large-scale mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, which can provide nearby computing services by charging users a price. Service pricing schemes can regulate user task offloading and affect the total revenue of service providers. Investigating how to maximize the revenue of service provider and improve the utilization of edge computing resources becomes crucial while is challenging, considering the users mobility and the uncertainty of users service requests. In this paper, we model the dynamic pricing process of ECS as a Markov decision process and propose a dynamic pricing approach based on Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) by using the current load conditions and user characteristics, the goal of which is to maximize the revenue of service provider. In addition, considering more ECSs in the MEC system, with the dynamic variations of ECSs loads and the different arrival rate of user tasks, we propose a joint scheduling approach based on D3QN (called RLJS) to collectively improve the total service revenue of service providers. Specifically, we first use a data-driven method to group the ECSs and then devise a D3QN-based task scheduling scheme to distribute tasks among ECS groups by considering the load and price conditions in real time. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of RLJS in improving the total revenue of the system provider and reducing the user delays.}

	abstract = {In high-speed networks, flow-level traffic measurement is an essential tool to understand how network bandwidth is being utilized. It can be used to detect anomalous traffic behaviors due to operational or security issues. Perhaps the most important measurement task is to track the heavy hitters (HHs), i.e., the flows occupying the greatest shares of bandwidth. But most existing solutions have no concept of time window: Whenever a measurement period ends, the data sketch, which is deployed in the data plane for monitoring HHs, must be transferred to the control plane and then reset to zeros. It is better to capture network conditions of the continuous recent past by designing a HHs measurement solution that can support time-decaying window. As a result, recently several related works are devoted to tracking the time-decaying heavy hitters, including time-decaying CountMin and time-decaying Space-Saving. However, their memory-accuracy tradeoff is still suboptimal. In this paper, we attain higher performance by proposing a new algorithm named DecayAware Cuckoo Filter along Kicking Path (DAKP-CF). It can be regarded as a variant of cuckoo filter (an improved version of hash table with better memory efficiency), which transforms each bucket into a bucket-level min-heap. Its key advantage is that, when we update the table as a packet arrive, it can discover and replace the most time-decayed flow along the kicking path of a cuckoo filter. We deliberately avoid scanning the entire table to keep the high time efficiency. The experiment results show that our DAKP-CF can reach the same identification accuracy as existing methods with roughly 25% memory cost. In addition, we build a prototype of our DAKP-CF by P4-programmable BMv2 software switch.}

	abstract = {Much effort has been devoted to improving the performance of network transmission. Yet, the impact of packet size which is limited by the 1500-byte maximum transmission unit (MTU) has not received adequate attention. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that jumbo frames which are commonly used as an alternate do not always yield the best performance under different transmission situations.In this paper, we elaborate on the limitations of the regular and jumbo frames and analyze how packet sizes affect network performance. Based on these, we present Adaptively Packet Sizing (APS), a dynamic packet size adjustment method that can be easily integrated into existing window-based congestion control algorithms. APS utilizes a machine learning method to predict the optimal packet size, which can minimize flow completion time (FCT) according to the instantaneous network condition. Besides, a packet size based priority mechanism is proposed to further improve the performance. We implement APS in both simulation and testbed environments. APS reduces the FCT by up to 50% and gains better performance in scenarios with various loss rates.}

	abstract = {For the recent two years, companies such as Starlink, Kuiper, and Telesat are launching low earth orbit (LEO) satellites to form LEO satellite mega-constellations. Unfortunately, the LEO satellite mega-constellations are not sustainable in the long term since their large size makes LEO congested, causing issues such as satellite brightness, satellite conjunction, and space debris. The issues become worse as LEO satellites have shorter battery lifespans and experience drag force, which shortens the satellite life and produces more space debris objects when LEO satellites reach the end of life. To address the issues, we propose deploying higher-orbit satellites to form a satellite-based sustainable multi-tier space network (SMTSN) instead of launching a massive number of LEO satellites. In this paper, we model the costs and gains for routing traffic with our SMTSN framework. We propose a solution to find the optimal routing paths and an efficient distributed coverage-aware (EDCA) algorithm to predict the number of skipped LEO satellites when the traffic is routed through a higher-orbit satellite. We run extensive simulations to compare the LEO satellite constellations with and without our SMTSN framework, and the results show a significant improvement in the battery cell cycle life consumption with the SMTSN framework.}

	abstract = {Packet classification is the most essential component for switches and firewalls to perform network functions. In Software Defined Network, the growing scale of traffic requires the packet classification algorithm to perform high-speed lookup. Even though a lot of algorithms are proposed, the lookup performance is still the bottleneck because of the inefficient and unscientific schemes to cut rules and split trees. In this paper, we propose a novel decision-tree-based algorithm PextCuts. First, to efficiently cut rules, PextCuts applies one pext CPU instruction to select discontiguous bits rather than contiguous bits. Second, to scientifically split trees, PextCuts applies the dynamic programming method to split each field into multiple sizes rather than large and small sizes. Compared to ten representative algorithms, PextCuts has the highest lookup speed with the minimal numbers of average memory accesses, maximal memory accesses, and tree height simultaneously. It also consumes the least memory cost and the shortest construction time. For the state-of-the-art algorithm ByteCuts, PextCuts achieves 2.1x lookup speed with only 57% memory cost and 10% construction time. In addition, we implement PextCuts in DPDK to perform packet classification with optional fields and achieve 3.0x lookup speed.}

	abstract = {Edge computing is a new computing paradigm rising gradually in recent years. Applications, such as object detection, virtual reality and intelligent cameras, often leverage Deep Neural Networks (DNN) inference technology. The traditional paradigm of DNN inference based on cloud suffers from high delay because of the limited bandwidth. From the perspective of service providers, caching DNN models on the edge brings several benefits, such as efficiency, privacy, security, etc.. The problem we concerned in this paper is how to decide the cached models and how to allocate processors of edge servers to reduce the overall system cost. To solve it, we model and study the DNN Model Caching and Processor Allocation (DMCPA) problem, which considers user-perceived delay and energy consumption with limited edge resources. We model it as an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem, and prove its NP-Completeness. Since it is considered as a long-term average optimization problem, we leverage the Lyapunov framework to develop a novel online algorithm DMCPA-GS-Online with Gibbs Sampling. We give the theoretical analysis to prove that our algorithm is near-optimal. In experiments, we study the performance of our algorithm and compare it with other baselines. The simulation results with the trace dataset from real world demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptiveness of our algorithm.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting can reveal which sensitive website a user visits over encrypted network traffic. Obfuscating encrypted traffic, e.g., adding dummy packets, is considered as a primary approach to defend against website fingerprinting. How-ever, existing defenses relying on traffic obfuscation are either ineffective or introduce significant overheads. As recent website fingerprinting attacks heavily rely on deep neural networks to achieve high accuracy, producing adversarial examples could be utilized as a new way to obfuscate encrypted traffic. Unfortunately, existing adversarial example algorithms are designed for images and do not consider unique challenges for network traffic.In this paper, we design a new method, named AdvTraffic, which can customize perturbations produced by any existing adversarial example algorithm on images and derive adversarial examples over encrypted traffic. Our experimental results show that the integration of AdvTraffic, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks, can effectively mitigate the accuracy of website fingerprinting from 95.0% to 10.2%, even if an attacker retrains a classifier with defended traffic. Compared to other defenses, our method outperforms most of them in mitigating attack accuracy and offers the lowest bandwidth overhead.}

	abstract = {The 802.11ax amendment introduced Triggered Uplink Access (TUA) to Wi-Fi to support uplink Multi-User (MU) MIMO. TUA coordinates simultaneous transmission of uplink users via an AP-transmitted trigger that gives an AP-selected group of users permission to transmit simultaneously for an AP-selected duration of time. Thus, TUA promises performance gains by enabling multi-user transmission and reducing contention overhead for access. In this paper, for the first time, we experimentally study the role of real application traffic on the performance of TUA. In particular, while TUA gains for fully backlogged traffic are well established, we show that bursty closed-loop traffic radically transforms performance. Using a real-time emulator, we experimentally evaluate the empirical limits of triggered uplink multi-user access with traffic from a real file transfer application and different uplink triggering strategies. Our results show that TUA significantly reduces file transfer latency compared to legacy single-user uplink, but unfortunately the standardized method for low-overhead backlog reporting leaves substantial benefits unrealized. Moreover, we show that unlike a single-user uplink, TUA has non-monotonic performance with respect to the frame aggregation limit.}

	abstract = {The vibrant markets offering data annotation services are fast-growing and play an important part in machine learning. While many multi-label prediction services are available, it is challenging for consumers to decide which services to use for their own tasks and budgets due to the heterogeneity in those services’ labeling categories, labeling quality and price. In this paper, we focus on a practical problem of obtaining high-quality multi-label annotation data from multiple services within a budget constraint. We propose a framework that firstly parameterizes the labeling generation based on the constructed Probabilistic Graph Model, and designs an Expectation Maximization(EM)-based iteration algorithm to estimate the service labeling quality and task truth distribution. Then we transform the annotation service selection strategy into an adaptive submodular maximization coverage problem, which motivates us to design an adaptive random greedy algorithm with a constant approximation ratio 1−1/e. We evaluate our design on both real-world experiments and a series of simulations on various machine learning models and real datasets. These experiments will show that our method has more accuracy and reliability improvements.}

	abstract = {With the explosion of data transmitted over the Internet, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) carry massive network traffic globally and suffer an increasingly higher bandwidth cost. A critical issue for CDN service providers is how to allocate network traffic among CDN facilities to reduce the total bandwidth cost without violating the quality of service. This work studies online traffic allocation in CDNs to minimize the bandwidth cost under the 95th percentile charging model. Specifically, we here take into account practical deployment issues in large-scale CDN systems, e.g., allocation granularity and deviation. We first theoretically prove the approximation hardness of the traffic allocation problem. We then propose a novel prediction-based algorithm named OnTPC, which effectively addresses constraints raised in practical deployment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OnTPC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is expected to save over a million dollars per month for our large-scale commercial CDN collaborator. Moreover, the performance of OnTPC is consistently outstanding under various settings, and specifically robust to large allocation deviation.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the quality of information service (QoIS) of COVID-19-related information on social media. Our goal is to provide reliable COVID-19 information service by accurately detecting the misleading COVID-19 posts on social media by exploring the community-contributed COVID-19 fact data (CCFD) from different social media platforms. In particular, CCFD refers to the fact-checking reports that are submitted to each social media platform by its users and fact-checking professionals. Our work is motivated by the observation that CCFD often contains useful COVID-19 knowledge facts (e.g., "COVID-19 is not a flu") that can effectively facilitate the identification of misleading COVID-19 social media posts. However, CCFD is often private to the individual social media platform that owns it due to the data privacy concerns such as data copyright of CCFD and user profile information of CCFD contributors. In this paper, we leverage the CCFD from different social media platforms to accurately detect COVID19 misinformation while effectively protecting the privacy of CCFD. Two critical challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) how to generate privacy-aware COVID-19 knowledge facts from the platform-specific CCFD? 2) How to effectively integrate the privacy-aware COVID-19 knowledge facts from different social media platforms to correctly assess the truthfulness of a COVID19 post? To address these challenges, we develop CoviDKG, a COVID-19 distributed knowledge graph framework that constructs a set of CCFD-based knowledge graphs on individual social media platform and exchanges the privacy-aware COVID19 knowledge facts across different platforms to effectively detect misleading COVID-19 posts. We evaluate CoviDKG on two real-world social media datasets and the results show that CoviDKG achieves significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art baselines in accurately detecting misleading COVID-19 posts on social media.}

	abstract = {Power-of-d-choices (Pod) is a popular load balancing strategy, which has received much attention from both academia and industry. However, much prior work on Pod has focused on uniform tasks without priorities. In reality, tasks may have different priorities according to their service sensitivity, pricing, or importance to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). In this work, we distinguish two types of priorities in Pod: scheduling and service priorities. We propose Pod-SSP, which is a Pod algorithm with Scheduling and Service Priorities. To better understand the impact of priorities on the performance of tasks, we consider two simple variants of Pod-SSP: Pod with SCheduling Priorities (Pod-SCP) and Pod with SErvice Priorities (Pod-SEP). Utilizing mean-field approximation, we systematically study the performance of these protocols in the large-system regime. Our theoretical and simulation results show that high-priority tasks can have a more than 3x better delay relative to a system running the original Pod algorithm, and meanwhile, low-priority tasks only slightly sacrifice their delay.}

	abstract = {Applications on mobile devices face varying network conditions in cellular networks. The connected radio cell is often changing, especially with moving devices. Different access technologies, varying signal strengths, or distance to the connected radio tower influence the Quality of Service (QoS) of mobile applications. Existing technologies like buffering or adaptive video streaming work reactive, i.e., they react to a decreasing download bitrate. In contrast, these technologies and mobile applications in general could benefit from early knowledge of the expected connection quality.This work investigates the predictability of QoS metrics in cellular networks based on the experience of previous measurements. For this, we developed an Android app to measure download bitrates with minimal data consumption. We performed over 90 000 measurements using a single network operator and analyzed how precise QoS indicators like packet round trip times and download bitrates can be predicted. We developed a methodology to predict the expected download bitrate along a route and present our approach of aggregating measurements into hexagons of dynamic size. The core contributions of this work are (i) a methodology and implementation of systematic measurement data collection, (ii) an open data publication of our measurement data set, and (iii) an approach for predicting QoS metrics in cellular networks based on aggregated measurements. Our results show, that our approach is able to predict the downlink bitrate, the packet round trip time (ping), or DNS query duration along a given route.}

	abstract = {Identifying anonymity services from network traffic is a crucial task for network management and security. Currently, some works based on deep learning have achieved excellent performance for traffic analysis, especially those based on flow sequence (FS), which utilizes information and features of the traffic flow. However, these models still face a serious challenge because of lacking a mechanism to take into account relationships between flows, resulting in mistakenly recognizing irrelevant flows in FS as clues for identifying traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel FS-based anonymity network traffic identification framework to tackle this problem, which leverages Residual Graph Convolutional Network (ResGCN) to exploit relationships between flows for FS feature extraction. Moreover, we design a practical scheme to preprocess the raw data of real-world traffic, which further improves identification performance and efficiency. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.}

	abstract = {In recent years, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is emerging to provide computation and storage capabilities to the Internet of things (IoT) devices to improve the quality of service (QoS) of IoT applications. In addition, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) techniques have attracted great interests from both academia and industry to improve the communication efficiency. Although existing works leverage the IRS technique in MEC networks, they mainly focus on the single-IRS single-area scenario. However, in practice, multi-IRS will be deployed in multi-area scenarios in future networks. Consequently, considering the single-IRS single-area scenario will have inferior performance. In this paper, to address the aforementioned issue, we propose an efficient resource provisioning scheme for multi-IRS multi-area scenarios in MEC networks. We first model the problem as a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning process, where each agent manages one area and all agents share the network bandwidth and computation resources. Then, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic method with an attention mechanism for resource management with latency guarantee. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Our scheme can reduce the required computation resources by up to 11.84% when compared with the benchmark works. It is also shown that our proposed scheme can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and scale well with the increasing demand from IoT devices.}

	abstract = {Coexisting applications contend for limited WAN bandwidth when communicating over distributed data centers in private clouds. Online service providers deploy distributed rate limiting systems to dynamically estimate each application instance’s bandwidth demand, and update rate limiting rules to provide performance isolation and bandwidth guarantees for applications with different priorities. However, the isolation violation caused by the inconsistent update of rate limiting rules among servers would eventually violate the Service Level Agreement requirements. Motivated by the observation that InNetwork Control can update rate limiting rules consistently with ultra-low latency for hundreds of thousands of end-hosts through in-band control messages, this paper presents DistRL, a dynamic distributed rate limiting system that can achieve fine-grained consistent updates. The main idea of DistRL is to replace the traditional controller with programmable switches to improve communication efficiency, thereby achieving finer-grained consistent updates. The evaluation shows that DistRL can support sub-second distributed updates of rate limiting rules without isolation violation for O(10 5 ) servers.}

	abstract = {As a practical paradigm designed to involve large numbers of edge devices in distributed training of deep learning models, federated learning has witnessed a significant amount of research attention in the recent years. Yet, most existing mechanisms on federated learning assumed either fully synchronous or asynchronous communication strategies between clients and the federated learning server. Existing designs that were partially asynchronous in their communication were simple heuristics, and were evaluated using the number of communication rounds or updates required for convergence, rather than the wall-clock time in practice.In this paper, we seek to explore the entire design space between fully synchronous and asynchronous mechanisms of communication. Based on insights from our exploration, we propose Port, a new partially asynchronous mechanism designed to allow fast clients to aggregate asynchronously, yet without waiting excessively for the slower ones. In addition, Port is designed to adjust the aggregation weights based on both the staleness and divergence of model updates, with provable convergence guarantees. We have implemented Port and its leading competitors in Plato, an open-source scalable federated learning research framework designed from the ground up to emulate real-world scenarios. With respect to the wall-clock time it takes for converging to the target accuracy, Port outperformed its closest competitor, FedBuff, by up to 40% in our experiments.}

However, due to diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in real network, existing multipath congestion control algorithms (CCAs) fail to fast adapt to dynamic traffic, which leads to performance degradation, especially in heterogeneous network environments. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we first observe the performance limitations of current multipath CCAs by conducting extensive experiments. Then we propose ACCeSS, an adaptive QoS-aware multipath congestion control framework, which is able to promptly adapt to network changes and QoS requirements with a novel control policy optimization phase. In order to adjust and stimulate improvement of the preferred performance metric, ACCeSS exploits Random Forest Regressing (RFR) method to perform QoS-specific utility function optimization. ACCeSS is implemented and compared with other multipath CCAs in Linux kernel. Performances of ACCeSS are evaluated in both emulated and real-world networks, which reveal that ACCeSS outperforms classic multipath CCAs and the state-of-the-art learning based multipath CCA with better adaptive capability of QoS.}

	abstract = {Serverless edge computing is booming as an efficient carrier of deploying complex applications composed of dependent functions, whose assignment decisions highly influence the application performance. Although similar problem has been widely studied, none of existing approaches considers the diversity of communication styles, which is specially introduced in serverless computing and also imposes high influence to the performance efficiency. We compare two communication styles, called direct-passing and remote-storage, to transmit intermediate data between functions. We find that there is no single communication style that can prevail under all scenarios and the optimal selection depends on several factors, such as fanout degree, data size, and network bandwidth. Hence, how to select the appropriate communication style for each inter-function communication link, together with the function assignment decision, is essential to the application performance. To this end, we propose a Priority-based ASsignment and Selection (PASS) algorithm with joint consideration of function assignment and communication style selection. We theoretically analyze the approximation ratio of PASS algorithm and extensive experiments on real-world applications show that PASS can averagely reduce the completion time by 24.1% in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {With constrained resources, what, where, and how to cache at the edge is one of the key challenges for edge computing systems. The cached items include not only the application data contents but also the local caching of edge services that handle incoming requests. However, current systems separate the contents and services without considering the latency interplay of caching and queueing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel class of stochastic models that enable the optimization of content caching and service placement decisions jointly. We first explain how to apply layered queueing networks (LQNs) models for edge service placement and show that combining this with genetic algorithms provides higher accuracy in resource allocation than an established baseline. Next, we extend LQNs with caching components to establish a joint modeling method for content caching and service placement (JCSP) and present analytical methods to analyze the resulting model. Finally, we simulate real-world Azure traces to evaluate the JCSP method and find that JCSP achieves up to 35% improvement in response time and 500MB reduction in memory usage than baseline heuristics for edge caching resource allocation.}

	abstract = {In recent years, much progress has been made in the field of Internet bandwidth reservation systems. While early designs were neither secure nor scalable, newer proposals promise attack resilience and Internet-wide scalability by using cryptographic access tokens (capabilities) that represent permissions to send at a guaranteed rate. Once a capability-based bandwidth reservation is established, the corresponding traffic is protected from both naturally occurring congestion and distributed denialof-service attacks, with positive consequences on the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) of the communication. However, high network utilization—possibly caused by adversaries—can still preclude the initial unprotected establishment of capabilities. To prevent such denial-of-capability (DoC) attacks, we present DoCile, a framework for the protection of capability establishment on Internet paths, irrespective of network utilization. We believe that DoCile, deployed alongside a capability-based bandwidth reservation system, can be the foundation of the next generation of secure and scalable QoS protocols.}

	abstract = {One key challenge to maintain a large-scale Content Delivery Network (CDN) is to minimize the service downtime when severe system problems happen (e.g., hardware failures). In this case, a critical step is to quickly and accurately identify the range of users with performance degradation, termed impact identification. Successful impact identification not only helps identify impacted users but also provides meaningful information for troubleshooting. However, current practice of impact identification usually takes network engineers several hours to manually identify impacted users, which may lead to a huge business loss. The main challenges for automatic impact identification in large CDNs include the inaccuracy of underlying anomaly detection, huge search space of impact identification and severe long-tail distribution of user traffic. In this paper we propose iSwift, a system that is specifically designed for impact identification in large-scale CDNs in order to address aforementioned challenges. We evaluate the performance of iSwift on semi-synthetic datasets and the results show that iSwift can achieve a F1-score greater than 0.85 within ten seconds, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, iSwift has been deployed in a production CDN around one year as a pilot project and demonstrated its online performance confirmed by the network operators.}

	abstract = {Characterizing the end-to-end network available bandwidth (ABW) is an important but challenging task. Although a number of ABW estimation tools have been introduced over the past two decades, applying them to the real-world networks is still difficult because of the biased results, heavy load, and long measurement time. In this paper, we propose a novel Burst Queue Recovery (BQR) model to infer the ABW. BQR first induces an instant network congestion and then observes the one-way delay (OWD) variation until the tight link recovers from the congestion. By correlating the OWDs with the queue length variation, BQR can calculate the ABW accurately. Compared to the traditional probe gap model (PGM) and probe rate model (PRM), our theoretical analysis and simulations show that BQR is more tolerant to the transient traffic burst and supports the scenarios with multiple congestible links. Based on the model, we build FABMon, a fast and accurate ABW estimation tool. Our experiments show that FABMon can measure ABW within 50 milliseconds, and achieve much more accurate measurement results than the existing tools with a very small volume of probe packets.}

	abstract = {Today’s Internet user experience greatly depends on some user-perceived network metrics, such as throughput and latency. To improve these metrics, many Internet content providers build the content delivery network (CDN) to provide their services. Generally, CDNs adopt TCP as their transport protocol. A recent line of work improves TCP by proposing novel congestion control algorithms. However, we measure TCP performance in the production CDN and identify an interesting phenomenon termed TCP capping. When the flows experience TCP capping, the fixed-size receive window (rwnd) restricts these flows from fully utilizing network bandwidth. Through in-depth analysis, we demystify that the root cause of TCP capping is an inappropriate constraint on rwnd due to not considering the receiver’s processing capability. To mitigate it, this paper proposes a server-side scheme Apollo and a client-side scheme Artemis for Internet content providers and users, respectively. Apollo probes the receiver’s processing capability and assists the sender in packet sending. And Artemis adjusts the receive buffer in light of the receiver’s processing capability. In our evaluation, compared to vanilla TCP, TCP (w/ Apollo) and TCP (w/ Artemis) shorten flow completion time by up to 91.8% and 94.9%, respectively.}

	abstract = {WiFi-based gait recognition is an attractive method for device-free user identification, but path-sensitive Channel State Information (CSI) hinders its application in multi-path environments, which exacerbates sampling and deployment costs (i.e., large number of samples and multiple specially placed devices). On the other hand, although video-based ideal CSI generation is promising for dramatically reducing samples, the missing environment-related information in the ideal CSI makes it unsuitable for general indoor scenarios with multiple walking paths.In this paper, we propose WiVi, a WiFi-video cross-modal fusion based multi-path gait recognition system which needs fewer samples and fewer devices simultaneously. When the subject walks naturally in the room, we determine whether he/she is walking on the predefined judgment paths with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier working on the WiFi-based human localization results. For each judgment path, we generate the ideal CSI through video-based simulation to decrease the number of needed samples, and adopt two separated neural networks (NNs) to fulfill environment-aware comparison among the ideal and measured CSIs. The first network is supervised by measured CSI samples, and learns to obtain the semi-ideal CSI features which contain the room-specific ‘accent’, i.e., the long-term environment influence normally caused by room layout. The second network is trained for similarity evaluation between the semi-ideal and measured features, with the existence of short-term environment influence such as channel variation or noises.We implement the prototype system and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that WiVi’s recognition accuracy ranges from 85.4% for a 6-person group to 98.0% for a 3-person group. As compared with single-path gait recognition systems, we achieve average 113.8% performance improvement. As compared with the other multi-path gait recognition systems, we achieve similar or even better performance with needed samples being reduced by 57.1-93.7%}

We first point out that the backscatter tag should fit the guard interval for different Bluetooth excitors. EAScatter uses a connection-based identification method, which can identify excitor during Bluetooth connection according to different shortest high level lengths. Thus, it can select a specific optimal guard interval for each excitor. Moreover, we introduce Plus-one modulation, which can further improve the goodput. We built a prototype of EAScatter and evaluated it with extensive experiments. EAScatter can achieve up to 98% identification accuracy. Using TI CC1352 as an excitor, it has a 25x PRR gain and a 28x goodput gain over the state-of-the-art RBLE.}

	abstract = {Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging network architecture that provides bounded latency and reliable network services for time-sensitive applications. Since time-triggered flows in TSN are typically periodic, a concept of network cycle is widely used in both standards and academic researches. However, although network cycle has gained popularity, its rationale has not yet been analyzed systematically.In this paper, we mathematically evaluate the performance of several flow scheduling algorithms in terms of flow schedulability with and without employing network cycle. We observe that only when the network cycle is set to a proper value can the performance of flow scheduling be significantly improved. To better evaluate the scheduling effect, a novel assessment metric and a goal-based optimization algorithm are introduced. Our experiment results show that the network cycle-based algorithm can achieve a considerable improvement (40% - 170% improvement in the number of scheduled flows) compared to the ones with network cycle disabled.}

Inspired by our pilot study, we design VPPlus to fulfill the potentials to compress the video as much as we can, while preserving analytical accuracy. VPPlus incorporates two core modules – offline profiling and online adaptation – to generate proper feedback automatically and quickly to tune on-device processing.

	abstract = {Private Set Operations (PSO) are a hot research topic and one of the most extensive research problems in data mining. In the PSO, Multi-party Private Set Union (MPSU) is one of the fundamental problems. It allows some participants to learn the union of their data sets without leaking any useful information. However, most of the existing works have high communication, computation and round complexities. In this paper, we first propose a novel and efficient protocol to securely compute MPSU under the semi-honest model. In our system model, there exist n participants where each participant has a set of size k (k could be different among participants). There are also up to t (0 ≤ t < n) participants which could collude with each other. We suppose the communication channels among participants are insecure and can easily suffer from eavesdropping attacks. Our first protocol using element computing algorithm and Homomorphic Encryption, i.e., HE-MPSU, only requires O(1) rounds and has O(nNλ) communication complexity which almost matches the communication lower bound Ω(nN/log n) for the MPSU problem, where λ is a security parameter and N (k ≤ N ≤ nk) is the set union cardinality. In addition, we note that for the two-party case, i.e., n = 2, our HE-MPSU protocol has the same complexities as the state-of-the-art work in [1]. For this special case, i.e., two-party Private Set Union (PSU), we further optimize and design a more efficient protocol using oblivious transfer (OT) protocol, i.e., OT-PSU. It only requires O(1) rounds and O(kλ) communication complexity which almost matches the communication lower bound Ω(k). More importantly, it avoids using computationally expensive public-key operations (exponentiations). In other words, the number of exponentiations in this protocol is independent of the size of the data sets. Compared with the existing protocols, our two protocols have the lowest communication, computation and round complexities.}

To guarantee the end-to-end QoS (i.e., deadline/jitter requirements) of sensing-controlling-actuating control loops (CL) applications, DMCS adopts Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), an emerging real-time Ethernet technology, for communication between end systems (ES). TSN provides a synchronized global clock and guarantees bounded delay for time-critical traffic in CLs, making it possible for DMCS to collaboratively schedule the computation (on ES) and communication (in TSN) to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. However, as modern DMCS tends to use fully-fledged Linux distributions (rather than a custom real-time OS) on ES to enjoy Linux’s mature ecosystem, it is challenging for DMCS to realize TSN-based QoS guarantees because the event-triggered scheduling of Linux on ES is incompatible with TSN.This paper proposes TAsk Scheduling Puppeteer (TASP), a mechanism that schedules CL tasks based on TSN without modifying the Linux OS. The key idea of TASP is to manipulate task scheduling by controlling the timing of CL packet submissions at the interface between TSN and ES. Specifically, TASP extracts two parameters: Fore Guardband (ForeGB) and Back Guardband (BackGB). During the ForeGB period before a CL packet’s submission, TASP forbids any packets’ submission; while during the BackGB period after a CL packet’s submission, TASP forbids any other CL packets’ submission. ForeGB and BackGB can ensure that there is at most one schedulable task on the ES at any time, and thus Linux has no choice but to schedule the only task, making the Linux scheduler a puppet. We have deployed TASP and evaluated it in real-world TSN switches based on an open-source TSN project, OpenTSN. The TASP-enabled ES can achieve task scheduling precisely based on TSN’s global clock, which outperforms the original ES by reducing end-to-end jitter from milliseconds to microseconds.}

	abstract = {Brightness scaling (BS) is an emerging and promising technique with outstanding energy efficiency on mobile video streaming. However, existing BS-based approaches totally neglect the inherent interaction effect between BS factor, video bitrate and environment context, and their combined impact on user’s visual perception in mobile scenario, leading to inharmonious between energy consumption and user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose PEO, a novel user-Perception-based video Experience Optimization for energy-constrained mobile video streaming, by jointly considering the inherent connection between device’s state of motion, BS factor, video bitrate and the resulting user-perceived quality. Specifically, by capturing the motion of on-the-run device, PEO first infers the optimal bitrate and BS factor, therefore avoiding bitrate-inefficiency for energy saving while guaranteeing the user-perceived QoE. On that basis, we formulate the device motion-aware and user perception-aware video streaming as an optimization problem where we present an optimal algorithm to maximize the object function, and thus propose an online bitrate selection algorithm. Our evaluation (based on trace analysis and user study) shows that, compared with state-of-the-art techniques, PEO can raise the perceived quality by 23.8%-41.3% and save up to 25.2% energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enables users to exploit the resources of cloud computing at a base station (BS) in proximity to the users where an MEC server is hosted. While we have advantage of being able to communicate with low latency and small network load in MEC networks, the resources in BSes are limited. One challenge is where to provide users with services from to make efficient use of resources. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of MEC system, the case that a BS fails needs to be considered. This paper proposes a service placement and user assignment model with preventive start-time optimization against a single BS failure in MEC networks. The proposed model preventively determines the service placement and user assignment in each BS failure pattern to minimize the worst-case penalty which is the largest penalty among all failure patterns. We formulate the proposed model as an integer linear programming problem. We introduce two algorithms, one is the greedy algorithm with allocation upgrade and the other is with allocation upgrade and preemption, to solve the problem. The results show that the introduced algorithms obtain a solution with the smaller worst-case penalty than the benchmark in a practical time.}

	abstract = {Data centers usually employ scale-out network topologies to provide sufficient network bandwidth for applications. The traditional equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing method is proposed to tackle the serious load imbalance problem across all links. However, it does not achieve the desired performance and still incurs low network throughput. Consequently, researchers recently redesigned some load balancing mechanisms for data center networks (DCNs) from different design dimensions. However, it remains open to systematically measure and evaluate their performance in various settings. It is impractical for evaluators to implement or simulate involved load balancing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, UFLB, which can well model and emulate representative load balancing mechanisms for data center networks in a lightweight way. This framework has overcome three significant challenges: model traffic distribution in the symmetry as well as asymmetry data center networks, characterize mainstream load balancing methods, and systematically combine them with high accuracy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model under not only general settings of data center networks but also some special settings, such as various link failures and asymmetric topologies. The results indicate that the deviation rate of UFLB is within 15% against the implementation of load balancing mechanisms, such as ECMP, CONGA, DRILL, HERMES, PRESTO, in NS2, while it can be several orders of magnitude faster.}

	abstract = {Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations promise broadband, low-latency network infrastructure from space for terrestrial users in remote areas. However, they face new QoS bottlenecks from infrastructure mobility due to the fast-moving LEO satellites and earth’s rotations. Both cause frequent space-ground link churns and challenge the network latency, bandwidth, and availability at the global scale. Today’s LEO networks mask infrastructure mobility with fixed anchors (ground stations) but cause single-point bandwidth/latency bottlenecks. Instead, we design LBP to remove the LEO network’s QoS bottlenecks from infrastructure mobility. LBP removes remote terrestrial fixed anchors via geographic addressing for shorter latencies and more bandwidth. It adopts local, orbit direction-aware geographic routing to avoid global routing updates for high network availability. LBP further shortens the routing paths by refining handover policies by satellites’ orbital directions. Our experiments in controlled testbeds and trace-driven emulations validate LBP’s 1.64× network latency reduction, 9.66× more bandwidth, and improve network availability to 100%.}

	abstract = {The unique hardware structure of Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) enables its unparalleled lookup throughput but also causes slow update due to the Priority Order Constraint (POC). With the increase of application demands, TCAM update has become a bottleneck in the network. This paper proposes a new TCAM management mechanism named BubbleTCAM to enable fast TCAM update, in which available empty entries are defined as bubbles. The core idea of Bub-bleTCAM is to uniformly distribute bubbles and dependency chains in TCAM, which is beneficial to updates. BubbleTCAM consists of two components: bubble management and rule insertion. Bubble management enables TCAM to have uniformly distributed bubbles at all times through three key procedures: bubble lock reservation, bubble lock release and bubble generation. Rule insertion ensures that dependency chains of rules are uniformly stretched and distributed in TCAM. In addition, BubbleTCAM avoids the reorder problem by pre-sorting. Our evaluation based on the rulesets generated by ClassBench shows that BubbleTCAM effectively reduces the average cost and worst cost (in units of rule movements) during rule updates by at least 48% and 50%, respectively. Especially for the worst cost, the performance can be improved by up to 196x.}

	abstract = {The AI inspired methods have entirely changed the network QoS landscape and brought better demand-guided experiences for the end-users. However, the increasing demands of satisfactory experiences require larger AI models, whose inference efficiency becomes the non-negligible drawback in the time-sensitive network QoS. In this work, we defined this challenge as the inference-QoS (iQoS) problem of the network QoS itself, which balances inference efficiency and performance for AI services. We design a unified iQoS metric to evaluate the AI-enhanced QoS frameworks with considerations on model performance, inference latency, and input scale. Then, we propose a two-stage pipeline as the exemplar for leveraging the iQoS metric in QoS-aware AI services: (i) enhance reconstruction ability, pretraining masked autoencoder extracts intrinsic data correlations by multi-scale masking; (ii) improve inference efficiency, forecasting masked decoder uses the data scale pruning in terms of spatial and temporal dimension for prediction. Comprehensive experiments on our method demonstrate its superior inference latency and overwhelming traffic matrix prediction performance.}

We re-architect the traditional three-tier architecture, i.e., data collection, data storage, and data query, for aggregate queries, and build a system named NQ/ATP. NQ/ATP offloads the aggregation operation in network queries onto network switches, which accelerates the query execution and frees up network resources. NQ/ATP further devises a route learning mechanism, query hierarchy load balancing policy, and hierarchy clustering mechanism to save forwarding table entries on switches, which better supports massive queries. The evaluation shows that NQ/ATP can support network aggregate queries with higher capacity, less traffic volume, finer granularity, and better scalability than traditional three-tier polling architectures. The three optimizations can effectively reduce the forwarding table usage by up to 97.55%.}

	abstract = {As a popular privacy-preserving model training technique, Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple end-devices to collaboratively train Deep Neural Network (DNN) models without exposing local privately-owned data. According to the FL paradigm, resource-constrained end-devices in IoT should perform model training which is computation-intensive, whereas the edge server occupied with powerful computation capability only performs model aggregation. Due to the above unbalanced computation pattern, IoT-oriented FL is time-consuming and inefficient. In order to alleviate the computation burden of end-devices, recent countermeasures introduce the edge server to assist end-devices in model training. However, existing works neither efficiently address the computation heterogeneity across end-devices nor reduce the leakage risk of data privacy. To this end, we propose a Federated Synergy Learning (FedSyL) paradigm which innovatively strikes a balance between training efficiency and data leakage risk. We explore the complicated relationship between the local training latency and multi-dimensional training configurations, and design a uniform training latency prediction method by applying the polynomial quadratic regression analysis. Additionally, we design the optimal model offloading strategy with the consideration of resource limitation and computation heterogeneity of end-devices, so as to accurately assign capability=matched device-side sub-models for heterogeneous end-devices. We implement FedSyL on a real test-bed comprising multiple heterogeneous end-devices. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FedSyL on training efficiency and privacy protection.}

	abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) proposed recently have achieved promising results on various graph learning tasks. Federated learning (FL) for GCN training is needed when learning from geo-distributed graph datasets. Existing FL paradigms are inefficient for geo-distributed GCN training since neighbour sampling across geo-locations will soon dominate the whole training process and consume large WAN bandwidth. We derive a practical federated graph learning algorithm, carefully striking the trade-off among GCN convergence error, wall-clock runtime, and neighbour sampling interval. Our analysis is divided into two cases according to the budget for neighbour sampling. In the unconstrained case, we obtain the optimal neighbour sampling interval, that achieves the best trade-off between convergence and runtime; in the constrained case, we show that determining the optimal sampling interval is actually an online problem and we propose a novel online algorithm with bounded competitive ratio to solve it. Combining the two cases, we propose a unified algorithm to decide the neighbour sampling interval in federated graph learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness with extensive simulation over graph datasets from real applications.}

	abstract = {Federated learning, in contrast to traditional learning paradigms, has demonstrated its unique advantages in providing intelligence at the edge. However, existing federated learning approaches focus on the end-to-end classification tasks requiring a simple collaboration procedure where each participant can perform its local training independently. Unfortunately, there are still many tasks relying on learning the distinguishable feature metrics with respect to all the data, which is a different collaboration procedure across training participants. For example, the model for people identification has to ensure the feature representing a person is dissimilar to those representing others. To enable such federated learning for deep metrics (a.k.a federated deep metric learning) is challenging due to the data privacy and procedure robustness issues. With the consideration of these two challenges, this work proposes a novel computing framework for federated deep metric learning. This framework leverages the system-algorithm co-design to address privacy concerns via the Trusted Execution Environment (SGX enclave) and Differential Privacy mechanism. It also introduces a large-scale federated protocol which can robustly and efficiently deal with practical factors like the network fluctuation. We implement and evaluate our computing framework with two settings. One is a real-world implementation with a large number of mobile devices, while the other one is in our controllable environment for conducting experiments in various tasks. Our evaluation results show that our computing framework is able to train federated deep metric learning models with excellent scalability, data privacy preserving, and considerable accuracy even in exception conditions.}

	abstract = {Network-wide monitoring is important for many network functions. However, monitoring data are often incomplete due to the need of sampling to reduce high measurement cost, system failure, and unavoidable transmission loss under severe communication. Instead of only targeting to estimate all missing monitoring data entries with a small set of measurement samples, we study a new order-preserved monitoring data estimation problem to accurately estimate the missing data entries while preserving the data entries’ order in the dataset. We propose a novel order-preserved tensor completion model that integrates both the low rank property and the order information into a joint learning problem to estimate the missing data. With well designed non-convex function to directly approximate the tensor rank and order-preserved constraint under the linear self-recovery method, our model can not only more accurately capture the low-rank property of monitoring data to increase the estimation performance of missing data, but also can capture the order information in monitoring data to ensure the estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments using four real datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art tensor completion algorithms, our proposed algorithm can provide more accurate estimation and keep the value order of recovered entries to more effectively retrieve top-k large entries.}

	abstract = {With the growing interest in web services during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for high-quality low-latency interactive applications has never been more apparent. Yet, packet losses are inevitable over the Internet, since it is based on UDP. In this paper, we propose Ivory, a new real-world system framework designed to support network adaptive error control in real-time communications, such as VoIP, using a recently proposed low-latency streaming code. We design and implement our prototype over UDP that can correct or retransmit lost packets conditional on network conditions and application requirements.To maintain the highest quality, Ivory attempts to correct as many lost packets as possible on-the-fly, yet incurring the smallest footprint in terms of coding overhead over the network. To achieve such an objective, Ivory uses a deep reinforcement learning agent to estimate the best coding parameters in real-time based on observed network states and experience learned. It learns offline the best coding parameters to use based on previously observed loss patterns and takes into account the round-trip time observed to decide on the optimum decoding delay for a low-latency application. Our extensive array of experiments shows that Ivory achieves a better trade-off between recovering packets and using lower redundancy than the state-of-the-art network adaptive streaming codes algorithms.}

	abstract = {Effective bandwidth prediction in the fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks is essential for bandwidth-consuming applications, such as virtual reality and holographic video streaming. However, accurate bandwidth prediction in 5G networks remains a challenging task due to the short-distance coverage and frequent handover properties of 5G base stations. In this paper, we propose HYPER, a HYbrid bandwidth PrEdiction appRoach using commercial smartphones. Hyper uses an AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) time series predictive model for intra-cell bandwidth prediction and a Random Forest (RF) regression model for cross-cell bandwidth prediction. Our ARMA model takes prior bandwidth usage as its input, while the RF model further uses related network and physical features to predict future bandwidth. We conduct a measurement study in commercial 5G networks to analyze the relationship between these features and bandwidth. Moreover, we also propose a handover window adaptation algorithm to automatically adjust the handover window size and determine which model to use during handover. We use commercial 5G smartphones for data collection and conduct extensive experiments in diverse urban environments. Experimental results based on one TB of cellular data show that HYPER can reduce the bandwidth prediction error by more than 13% compared to state-of-the-art bandwidth prediction approaches.}

	abstract = {Human pulmonary function declines with age. Elders, especially those with lung or cardiovascular diseases, yearn for daily lung function tests for timely diagnosis and treatment. However, current clinical spirometers are cumbersome and ex-pensive while home-use portable ones’ accuracy is questionable. Moreover, both kinds require contact measurements and could cause cross infection, especially hazardous for contagious diseases like COVID-19. To this end, we propose SpiroFi, a contactless system that leverages WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) for convenient yet accurate Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) out of clinic. The key enabler underlying SpiroFi is a set of algorithms that can extract chest wall movement from WiFi signal variations and interpret such information into lung function indices. We have realized SpiroFi on low-cost commodity WiFi devices and tested it in a home-like site where it achieves 2.55% monitoring error over healthy youths. Then, with the Ethics Committee (EC) approval, we conducted a 2-month clinic study in a city hospital over elders with basic diseases. SprioFi still yields 6.05% monitoring error despite elders’ degenerated pulmonary function and body control. Also, the correlation between lung function and age as well as chronic diseases has been revealed, highlighting the importance of daily PFT for the elderly.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the privacy-preserving adaptive ranking problem for multi-armed-bandit crowdsourcing, where according to the crowdsourced data, the arms are required to be ranked with a tunable granularity by the untrustworthy third-party platform. Any online worker can provide its data by arm pulls but requires its privacy preserved, which will increase the ranking cost greatly. To improve the quality of the ranking service, we propose a Privacy- Preserving Adaptive Ranking algorithm called PPAR, which can solve the problem with a high probability while differential privacy can be ensured. The total cost of the proposed algorithm is {\\mathcal{O}}(K\\ln K), which is near optimal compared with the trivial lower bound Ω(K), where K is the number of arms. Our proposed algorithm can also be used to solve the well-studied fully ranking problem and the best arm identification problem, by proper setting the granularity parameter. For the fully ranking problem, PPAR attains the same order of computation complexity with the best-known results without privacy preservation. The efficacy of our algorithm is also verified by extensive experiments on public datasets.}

	abstract = {To perform efficient packet classification, decision tree-based methods conduct decision trees via hand-tuned heuristics. Then the performance testing and optimization are executed to ensure an excellent searching speed and space overhead. Specifically, when the performance is below expectation, existing solutions attempt to optimize the algorithms, such as conducting more sophisticated heuristics. However, reconstruction or adjustment for algorithms produces an intolerable time overhead due to the long optimization period, caused by uncertain performance benefits and high pre-processing time. In this paper, we propose FROD, an efficient framework for optimizing the decision trees directly in packet classification. FROD raises a meticulous evaluation to accurately appraise decision trees constructed by different heuristics. It then seeks out the bottleneck components via a lightweight heuristic. After that, FROD searches the optimal division for inferior components considering structural constraints and characteristics of traffic distribution. Evaluation on ClassBench shows that FROD benefits existing decision tree-based solutions in classification time by 41% and memory footprint by 19% on average, and reduces classification time by up to 64%.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of scheduling real-time wireless flows under dynamic network conditions and general traffic patterns. The objective is to maximize the fraction of packets of each flow to be delivered within their deadlines, referred to as timely-throughput. The scheduling problem under restrictive frame-based traffic models or greedy maximal scheduling schemes like LDF has been extensively studied so far, but scheduling algorithms to provide deadline guarantees on packet delivery for general traffic under dynamic network conditions are very limited. We propose two scheduling algorithms using deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize timely-throughput for general traffic in dynamic wireless networks: RL-Centralized scheduling algorithm and RL-Decentralized scheduling algo-rithm. Specifically, we formulate the centralized scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a multi-environments double deep Q-network (ME-DDQN) structure is proposed to adapt to the dynamic network conditions. The decentralized scheduling problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and an expert-apprentice centralized training and decentralized execution (EA-CTDE) structure is designed to accelerate the training speed and achieve the optimal timely-throughput. The extensive results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms converge fast and adapt well to network dynamics with superior performance compared to baseline policies. Finally, experimental tests confirm simulation results and also show that the proposed algorithms are feasible in practice on resource limited platforms.}

	abstract = {The limitation on the flight range motivates a hybrid monitoring system, wherein trucks carrying drones drive to pre-planned positions and then free drones for task execution. While the flight range limitation is mitigated, it is challenging to determine the destination of trucks and drones and set airborne cameras. This paper optimizes the joint Deployment of trUcks and dronEs for objecT monitoring (DUET), that is, deploy a set of trucks where each truck carries drones, and each drone is equipped with a varifocal camera such that the overall monitoring utility for target objects is maximized. To tackle the DUET problem, we first model the hybrid system and monitoring utility; then, discretize the solution space of DUET with performance bound. In this way, the problem is transformed into a two-level combinatorial optimization problem satisfying submodularity. To address it, a two-level greedy algorithm with\n(e−1)\n2\ne(2e−1)\n⋅(1−ε)\napproximation ratio is proposed to select deployment strategies. After the strategy selection, an optimal method is devised to carefully adjust the strategy for energy saving and communication improvement without loss of monitoring utility. Both simulations and field experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework, which outperforms baseline algorithms on monitoring utility by at least 28.4% and 40%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Along with the ever-increasing amount of data generated from edge networks, cross domain (also known as Autonomous Systems, AS) transmission problem has attracted more and more attention. As mature and widely used inter-domain routing protocols, BGP-based solutions often use the number of domains (i.e. AS hops) of each path to make inter-domain routing decisions, which is simple and effective, but usually can not get the optimal routing results due to the lack of real state/information within ASes. These protocols choose the path with less AS hops as the forwarding path, even if the total latency or cost of the domains on this path is higher. While to solve this problem, directly access to intra-domain information as the assistance to make routing decisions is impractical due to data privacy.In this paper, we propose DIT, which makes near-optimal inter-domain routing decisions with desensitized intra-domain information. To do so, we design a homomorphic encrypted-based private number comparison scheme to export intra-domain information securely and thus assist in routing decisions. We conduct a series of experiments according to five real network topologies with nearly 900 simulated flows, and the results show that DIT reduces the number of forwarding hops by about 45% in average and reduces flow completion time by about 60%.}

	abstract = {Distributed deep learning is a typical machine learning method running in distributed environment such as cloud computing systems. The corresponding training, validation and test datasets are very large in general (e.g., several TBs), which need to be stored across multiple data nodes. Due to the high disk failure ratio in cloud storage systems, one of the critical issues for distributed deep learning is how to efficiently tolerate disk failures in the training procedures. These failures can lead to a large amount of data loss, which decreases the training accuracy and slows down the training process. Although several recovery methods are proposed to accelerate the data reconstruction, the related overhead is extremely high, such as high CPU/GPU utilization, a large number of I/Os, etc.To address the above problems, we propose a novel Partial-Recovery Method (called PRM) , which is an adaptive recovery method to accelerate data reconstruction for distributed deep learning applications in cloud storage systems. The key idea of PRM is combining the advantages of erasure coding’s ability to obtain global information on the data distribution with the AI’s ability to recover partial lost data, which can sharply reduce the overhead with acceptable training accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRM approach, we conduct several experiments. The results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art full or approximate recovery methods, PRM decreases the average network transmission time overhead by up to 64.50%, and reduces the recovery time by up to 55.90%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Quantum Data Networks (QDNs) typically leverage teleportation to reliably send data quantum bits (called qubits) to their destinations. To teleport a data qubit from Alice to Bob, one entanglement connection between Alice and Bob needs to be established. Accordingly, we have to establish as many entanglement connections as possible with limited quantum resources in order to maximize the network throughput. Conventional methods assume a known traffic matrix and calculate the paths to establish entanglement connections in one batch using a centralized algorithm. However, these methods are not scalable in large scale QDNs since it is time consuming to optimize the entanglement paths for a batch of requests, which may result in a long time slot duration and significantly reduce the network throughput. To address this issue, we propose an Online Entanglement Routing (OER) scheme which determines the entanglement paths for each request when it arrives. In addition, OER pursues work conservation and fairness among all requests in the QDNs. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that OER not only outperforms two representative heuristics by up to 61.27% and 52.79%, respectively, in terms of average request completion time, but also achieves a better fairness performance than these two counterparts.}

	abstract = {Video surveillance systems have demonstrated their great importance in security protection these years. However, due to limited budget, installing cameras in every place of surveillance region is not practical and then blind areas become inevitable. As a result, eliminating blind areas with the lowest cost has become a tough challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that fixes the blind spots of video surveillance systems based on WiFi sensing technique. By taking existing WiFi infrastructure as the sensing device, this paper attempts to eliminate blind spots with tiny hardware cost. Moreover, in order to completely fix blind area with minimum loss of video communication QoS, the WiFi sensing device’s location boundary that satisfies the above objective is modeled and estimated. To that end, a visitor-disturbed channel model is first derived for precisely describing the inherent relation between the appearance of visitor and the change of wireless channel. Then a location boundary model satisfying both blind-area elimination and QoS maximization is further derived. Based on the derived model, a practical system is designed to estimate the real location boundary. The simulation and experiment results have not only verified the correctness of our derived location boundary model, but also showed its good performance on both blind-area elimination and communication QoS optimization.}

	abstract = {In recent years, with the spread of video streaming services and remote web conferencing systems, the increase in the number of end hosts connected to the Internet, the improvement of end host performance, and the diversification and sophistication of applications, the demand for communication quality of service (QoS) from users and service providers has become even higher. However, the amount of traffic flowing through the network is increasing year by year, and it has become difficult to operate a system that guarantees a certain level of QoS for users. In other words, best-effort type network systems have become the mainstream. Not only QoS, but also the user's own quality of experience (QoE) has become important, and application level control to improve user QoE within limited communication resources has become very important for both users and service providers. Since QoE is a subjective measure of a user's perception of a service, it is considered to be affected by cognitive biases that are observed in human subjective decision-making. In this paper, we conduct an experiment focusing on the choice-supportive bias, which is one of the cognitive biases, and clarify the effect of this cognitive bias on users during video viewing.}

	abstract = {In order to support the 5GB5G network with huge connections, large traffic, and low latency, the evolution of the IP network to the IPv6 network is an inevitable trend. Although IPv6 network has significantly improved network performance, there are still a series of network failures. After the failure occurs, it is necessary for the routing algorithm to create a backup path to ensure the continuous provision of network services. So, the selection of the backup path directly determines the performance of the network service. SRv6 takes advantage of the programmable capability of the IPv6 extension header to implement differentiated reliable routing, satisfies the QoS requirements of different network services, and improves user experience. First, we design the network model for single link failure, define the network service, and design the two-dimensional flow table. Then, the backup path traversal algorithm is designed to obtain the universal set of backup paths in the network, and the optimal backup path for a specific network service is selected through comprehensive evaluation method. Experimental results show that the differentiated reliable routing mechanism proposed in this paper exhibits better performance in terms of bandwidth, delay, jitter and packet loss rate compared with the benchmark mechanism.}

	abstract = {Since the inception of networking technology, network topology design has been a fundamental step for any interconnected system. This classical problem has diverse forms due to various design criteria. One special criterion, the ease of monitoring the network (termed as monitorability of the network), has recently attracted much attention in the era of Industry 4.0 when many complex private networks need to be built for new industrial services. This paper extends a quantitative measure of network monitorability, k-identifiability, based on which a new form of network topology design problem is formulated. We prove that this network design problem is intractable. To solve it, we systematically analyze the topological features that are helpful for reducing the complexity of network construction. Based on the analysis, we propose a dual-heuristic method that runs two heuristics in parallel and selects the better topology as the preliminary design result. Moreover, we design an integrated algorithm that reduces unnecessary edges as the final design result. We compare our dual-heuristic algorithm with the theoretical optimal solution in small-scale networks where the brute-force search is feasible. The results demonstrate the near-optimality of our method. We also illustrate the capability of our method in designing large-scale networks.}

	abstract = {As one of the most popular in-memory cache systems, Redis provides low-latency and high-performance data access for modern internet services. However, in large-scale Redis systems, the access skewness and locality in storage workloads induce a small number of hot-spot instances with degraded system performance and massive cold instances with low CPU utilization. This paper proposes HPUCache to address the hot-spots via data copying and cold instances via instance merging. HPUCache fully utilizes the cached mapping in Redis client, and dynamically updates this mapping to enable access to the multiple data copies. Hence it can manage multiple copies achieving both Redis client compatibility and high user access performance. It also proposes an asynchronous instance merging strategy based on disk snapshots and temporal caches, which separates the massive data movement from the critical user access path to achieve high performance instance merging. We integrate HPUCache into Redis. Experiments under two types of workloads show that, compared to the native Redis design, HPUCache achieves 2.4× and 3.5× performance gains, 2× and 6× CPU utilization gains respectively.}

	abstract = {Clustered Federated Learning (FL) addresses heterogeneous objectives from different client groups, by capturing the intrinsic relationship between data distributions of clients. This work aims to minimize the completion time of clustered FL training while guaranteeing convergence, given the following challenges. First, clients’ data distributions are not static since their interests are usually time-varying. Obsolete data may incur training failures, requiring detection of distribution changes at runtime. Second, even with the same distribution, client datasets may have different contributions to model accuracy. Besides, the training data typically arrive at clients dynamically, which brings uncertainties to assessing the quality of client data. Third, the execution environments of clients and networks are often unstable and stochastic, leading to uncertainties in calculating computation and communication time. Given the above challenges, we propose Acct with two innovations: i) change detection: we first model the time-varying interests of clients as piecewise stationary based on practical observations, then apply generalized likelihood ratio detectors to FL for detecting changes in client distributions; ii) client selection: we adopt the multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique to account for the uncertainties in measuring data quality, computation and communication time. Based on the upper confidence bound (UCB) method, we construct a novel “double UCB” policy to adaptively select clients with high data quality and low computation and communication overhead. We rigorously prove the convergence of Acct and sub-linear regret regarding the proposed client selection policy. Finally, we implement Acct using PyTorch and conduct experiments showing that Acct reduces the completion time by almost 18.2% compared with three state-of-the-art FL frameworks.}

	abstract = {In Internet of Things (IoT) employing centralized machine learning, security is a major concern due to the heterogeneity of end devices. Decentralized machine learning (DML) with blockchain is a potential solution. However, blockchain with proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism wastes computing resources and adds latency to DML. Computing resources can be utilized more efficiently with proof-of-useful-work (uPoW), which secures transactions by solving real-world problems. We propose a novel uPoW method that exploits PoW mining to accelerate DML through a task scheduling framework for multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. To provide a good quality-of-service for the system, we minimize the latency by solving a multi-way number partitioning problem in the extended form. A novel uPoW-based mechanism is proposed to schedule DML tasks among MEC servers effectively. Simulation results show that our proposed blockchain strategies accelerate DML significantly compared with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {There is a growing trend that network applications not only require higher throughput, but also impose stricter delay requirements. The current Internet congestion control, which is driven by active queue management (AQM) algorithms interacting with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), has been playing an important role in supporting network applications. However, it still exhibits many open issues. Most of AQM algorithms only deploy a single-queue structure that cannot differentiate flows and easily leads to unfairness. Moreover, the parameter settings of AQM are often static, making them difficult to adapt to the dynamic network environments. In this paper, we propose a general framework for designing "self-tuning" queue management (SQM), which is adaptive to the changing environments and provides fair congestion control among flows. We first present a general architecture of SQM with fair queueing and propose a general fluid model to analyze it. To adapt to the stochastic environments, we formulate a stochastic network utility maximization (SNUM) problem, and utilize online convex optimization (OCO) and control theory to develop a distributed SQM algorithm which can self-tune different queue weights and control parameters. Numerical and packet-level simulation results show that our SQM algorithm significantly improves queueing delay and fairness among flows.}
