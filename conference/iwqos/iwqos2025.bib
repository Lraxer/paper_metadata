Secure aggregation offers pro-tection via masking and secret sharing, yet suffers from high communication overhead. We propose NET-SA, a secure aggregation architecture based on in-network computing. By employing homomorphic pseudorandom generators for local masking and leveraging programmable switches for seed aggregation, NET-SA eliminates key negotiation and secret sharing steps, reducing communication cost and improving dropout tolerance. Experiments on Tofino switches demonstrate up to 77× faster runtime and 2× lower communication overhead compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {As the foundational components of large-scale applications, distributed key-value stores must respond to user requests quickly. However, a user request typically comprises multiple key-value access operations, which are processed in parallel across different servers, and the response time is determined by the slowest operation. To reduce the mean response time of requests, existing approaches schedule the sequence of key-value access operations across different servers so that all operations of a request complete at approximately the same time. Nevertheless, all of these approaches operate in a distributive manner, and their theoretical performance boundaries are unknown. To address these issues, we designed SDN-KVS (Key-Value Scheduler based on Software Defined Network), which migrates the waiting queue of key-value access operations from overloaded servers to the SDN controller. In this way, SDN-KVS centrally schedules the requests from different clients to overloaded servers without extra latency overhead. The scheduling result is proven to be  ( 1 + 2 η ) (1+2 \\eta) -approximation, i.e., the mean response time of requests is smaller than ( 1 + 2 η 1+2 \\eta ) times of the optimal value, where  η \\eta  is the parameter to make a trade-off between mean and tail response time. Simulation results confirm the excellent performance of the SDN-KVS algorithm. Specifically, SDN-KVS outperforms existing algorithms up to 37.6% and 79.8% in terms of mean and tail response time, respectively.}

	abstract = {In communication scenarios where information is highly valuable and privacy protection is essential, such as internal networks of governments and companies, network security plays a crucial role. The emergence of programmable networks offers a new approach to achieving network security. This paper proposes an endogenous security method based on programmable networks and, for the first time, uses the programmable data plane programming language P4 to implement dynamic address hopping and key field obfuscation. This method conceals the real IP, MAC, and Port information of the data packet during the communication process, thereby increasing the difficulty of identifying and tracking the location and identity of the attacker. At the same time, the implementation of dynamic address hopping and key field obfuscation does not require communication with the control plane; instead, it is implemented within the data plane, thereby saving on communication delay and memory usage. Through simulation experiments, the additional communication delay and CPU utilization introduced by the PNEST were evaluated. The results showed that the communication delay increased to approximately 8 ms and the CPU utilization to approximately 5% during the data packet transmission process, demonstrating the feasibility and practicality of the PNEST.}

	abstract = {Network failure uncertainty and traffic demand uncertainty pose a series of challenges to efficiently solve network traffic engineering (TE) problems in the production wide-area networks (WANs). Prior works especially predict-then-optimize paradigm in TE systems encounter a significant mismatch between the upstream prediction task and the downstream optimization task, leading to potential demand loss risk and further degrading the quality of services in the cloud. In this paper, we present TUFTTE, a risk-driven TE optimization framework, where the objective function and constraints can be flexibly specified by the network operators. We employ a differentiable optimization layer to guide the prediction model with the objective of minimizing the network risks. When the network risk is defined as the demand loss, our approach can provably converge to the global optimum. Experimental results on real-world topology demonstrate that TUFTTE reduces the demand loss by 11.59 % on average compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. We believe that our paper deeply explores the potential of prediction and promotes the understanding on how to develop and deploy a general learning module into the commercial TE optimization.}

	abstract = {Sparse Mobile CrowdSensing has emerged as a practical method for data collection, recruiting mobile users to collect partial data and leveraging spatiotemporal correlations to infer the missing data. To improved the QoS of crowdsourced data, existing methods typically assume that the scales of collected data are similar. However, in real-world scenarios, the diversity of user devices results in data collections that vary in scale. More importantly, the collected coarser-scale data points often do not perfectly correspond to multiple finer-scale data points, resulting in highly complex compositional relationships and posing significant challenges for multi-scale data completion. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-scale data completion framework designed to process and integrate multi-scale data with non-aligned compositional relationships. We first align features across scales using the least common multiple scaling, then enhance the interaction and integration of data across scales through a bidirectional processing strategy and modified Mamba architectures, specifically ST-Mamba and Cross-Mamba. Evaluated on six real-world datasets, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling multi-scale data completion challenges, particularly when dealing with non-aligned compositional relationships.}

	abstract = {The Internet lacks mechanisms to verify the authenticity of packet forwarding paths, leading to numerous attacks that manipulate the data plane forwarding process. In response to such security threats, path verification is clearly essential. This security solution ensures that data packets remain untampered and their forwarding paths are authentic. However, existing path verification schemes are constrained by two major challenges: First, in large-scale deployment scenarios, each node must maintain a point-to-point trust relationship across the entire deployment, significantly increasing router processing delays and storage overhead. Second, a complete packet forwarding path often traverses regions with varying management and verification policies, which current path verification schemes struggle to unify. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel data plane path verification scheme called HVTT(Hierarchical Path Verification with Trust Transfer). HVTT adopts the concept of Address Domain to facilitate cross-domain trust transfer, dividing the end-to-end forwarding process into collaborative efforts across several address domains. Different path verification methods can be employed between various Autonomous Systems (ASs) within an address domain. The verification and exchange of labels across address domains facilitate trust transfer. Its hierarchical design substantially reduces the number of trust relationship objects that need to be maintained. The trust transfer method enables cooperation between address domains, allowing effective adaptation to different security policy regions along the path. We implemented the HVTT prototype on VMware, and experiments showed that HVTT reduced forwarding verification delay by 40.47 % and increased throughput by 37.28 % compared to OPT in a four-hop Round-Trip Time (RTT) scenario.}

	abstract = {Live streaming platforms like Douyin have developed the Live Streaming Hyper-Edge Delivery Network (LSHEDN) to reduce bandwidth cost. In LS-HEDN, the Content Delivery Network (CDN) splits the live streaming into multiple substreams by randomly assigning each frame to them. Hyperedge devices like set-top boxes with cheap and idle bandwidth resources forward a substream from CDN to multiple users. A protocol based on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is adopted between devices and users, with users detecting packet loss and requesting retransmissions via Negative Acknowledgment (NACK). Given the demand for lower latency and the inherent fluctuations in public network, existing receiver-side packet loss detection and retransmission methods fall short in achieving both timeliness and accuracy simultaneously. This is manifested as frequent rebuffering and excessive redundancy. Notably, when head-of-line blocking(HOL blocking) occurs in the upstream link of the device, these issues become even more pronounced. To address this, we propose Hyper-Edge Loss Detection and Retransmission (HELDR) algorithm. It features a loss detection algorithm tailored to the transmission characteristics in LSHEDN, which improves detection accuracy. Its immediate retransmission mechanism and the backup devices retransmission mechanism enhance timeliness. Large-scale online A/B tests results show that HELDR reduces the average rebuffering rate by 41.2%, reduces the average redundancy rate by 15.7%.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have become increasingly frequent, presenting substantial challenges to the management of network services. Using provenance graphs for log analysis has become a common approach in APT detection. However, existing research has two shortcomings: it does not fully utilize richer contextual semantic information and fails to effectively respond to unknown attacks. This paper presents SGAM, an accurate and fast APT detection framework. SGAM enhances accuracy through a training process driven by a masking strategy. The masking strategy includes the selection of masked nodes and a more robust training approach. SGAM incorporates the importance of provenance graph nodes into the masking strategy, gradually increasing the significance of the masked information during training, allowing the model to learn more critical node features. This enables the model to extract deeper contextual semantic information. In anomaly detection, SGAM employs an unsupervised method to ensure effective detection of unknown attacks while improving detection efficiency. We evaluated SGAM on three widely used datasets, and the results indicate that SGAM demonstrates outstanding detection performance across all scenarios, outperforming existing methods. Additionally, experiments show that SGAM can mitigate the impact of concept drift to some extent.}

	abstract = {Monitoring the structural health of bridges, especially sea-crossing bridges, is vital for their longevity and safety. Among the potential risks during the operation of sea-crossing bridges, vortex-induced vibration (VIV) has drawn significant attention due to its potential to cause collapse. To accurately detect VIV, introducing new sensors such as GNSS has become a trend. However, current methods often suffer from high latency and low reliability. Additionally, the integration of GNSS poses significant challenges to power supply. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based adaptive GNSSIMU fusion method for low-latency, high-accuracy, and energyefficient detection of bridge VIV. We have employed a lightweight Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to replace traditional VIV detection methods, significantly reducing the latency of VIV detection. Additionally, Our method is the first to leverage the unique reflection mechanisms of the ocean surface to model GNSS multipath effects, significantly enhancing the accuracy of adaptive data fusion. Finally, the adaptive fusion mechanism has also substantially decreased the power consumption associated with integrating GNSS. The method is validated using both synthetic data and real vibration testbed data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional VIV monitoring methods, our approach reduces detection latency from minutes to seconds while maintaining high detection accuracy. Under the same power supply conditions, the deployment duration is extended by 41.8%. We have also designed an IoT-based bridge Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) station to execute our algorithm.}

	abstract = {Enhancing model performance on low-capacity devices remains a significant challenge in the Internet of Models (IoM). Inspired by the efficiency of disentangled representation learning, this study proposes a model decomposition approach to improve response time on low-capacity devices while maintaining accuracy, through collaborative learning with models deployed on higher-capacity devices. First, we introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes and learns knowledge within each data sample. This enables lightweight sub-models, tailored to specific knowledge components, to respond efficiently on low-capacity devices in the IoM system. Second, we design a progressive crossfusion mechanism to promote mutual enhancement among these knowledge-specific sub-models. Third, we optimize the learning process by aligning the updates of these sub-models with those of the models on higher-capacity devices. This collaborative optimization is guided via knowledge distillation during model aggregation. Experimental results on image classification tasks demonstrate that our approach reduces response time by 9.87 % to 60.31 % without compromising accuracy.}

	abstract = {The distributed deployment of Large Language Models (LLM) on edge servers close to users has unlocked the service provider's potential to deliver low-latency inference. To obtain more benefit by serving more resource-demanding inference tasks based on resource-limited edge servers, it is critical for the service provider to allocate inference to suitable edge servers. Three new challenges hinder existing approaches from being implemented: the distributed LLM inference requires edge servers to collaborate following a novel workflow different from other tasks; the generative nature of LLM incurs uncertainty in task resource occupations; considering the heterogeneity in users' latency requirements and service benefit, merely minimizing the total user-perceived latency can not maximize the benefit. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study the edge inference allocation problem for distributed LLM deployment while conquering these challenges. Specifically, we propose a collaborative workflow for edge servers to conduct distributed LLM inferences. Then, we estimate the resource occupations by employing Exact Conic Reformulation (ECR). Based on this, with the objective of maximizing the total service benefit, we formulate the inference allocation problem as a binary integer programming problem which is NP-hard. An approximate algorithm is proposed to find approximate solutions efficiently. Extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset demonstrate the performance of our approach.}

	abstract = {Enterprise tenants access networks with committed bandwidth quotas shared among multiple departments and diverse services within each department. As a result, cloud vendors need to simultaneously fulfill two requirements, i.e., committed bandwidth guarantee and tenant-specified service bandwidth allocation. Hierarchical bandwidth allocation is a widely used technology that satisfies both requirements. In traditional schemes, each tenant's traffic is processed by a single node, potentially leading to single-node failures. Previous works have enhanced reliability by extending existing schemes to distributed systems with tenant-level bandwidth allocation, but fail to meet both requirements simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose S-DAL, which can achieve both requirements through servicelevel distributed hierarchical bandwidth allocation. We introduce an efficient fluid model-based algorithm for bandwidth allocation and employ a memory utilization based flow rate estimation mechanism to deliver accurate flow rate measurements. Additionally, we integrate a burst detection to mitigate excessive packet loss caused by burst traffic. Through testbeds and simulations, we demonstrate that S-DAL effectively ensures tenant-specified service bandwidth allocation while only reducing the shortfall in committed bandwidth to less than 0.23%.}

A key challenge in malware detection lies in balancing the reduction of false positives with maintaining detection accuracy amid rapid software ecosystem evolution. Existing methods require substantial expert intervention to mitigate false positives and often neglect the resource-intensive measures required to address model degradation caused by software updates. This study introduces ASTBAR, a novel method that extracts fine-grained AST fragments to distill benign behavioral knowledge from webserver software. By leveraging program structure and semantic analysis, ASTBAR generates fragment-level representations of benign samples and employs fragment matching to identify malware. Unlike prior techniques, ASTBAR achieves simultaneous improvements in precision, recall, and adaptability to software evolution. The evaluation results demonstrate that ASTBAR achieves an F1 score of  6 5. 3 5 % \\mathbf{6 5. 3 5 \\%} , outperforming the state-of-theart methods by  1 0. 3 9 % \\mathbf{1 0. 3 9 \\%} .

	abstract = {Federated unlearning (FUL) facilitates targeted unlearning of data-specific artifacts from trained federated learning (FL) models. Existing methodologies primarily emphasize individual client demands at a time, such as enforcing the “right to be forgotten” or mitigating poor-quality data contributions from a single client. These strategies frequently rely on client-side computational engagement during unlearning. However, these approaches often neglect situations in which it is crucial to unlearn the contributions of multiple participants at a time from a global model. Therefore, we introduce a novel FUL method named “FULClean” to parallelly erase the adverse impacts of poor-quality data from multiple participants without using client resources and maintaining global model performance. FULClean employs a novel Contrastive Threshold-based Contribution Rectification (CTCR) mechanism, that (1) identifies and classifies the local models into unaffected and potentially affected local models, (2) computes the dynamic contribution threshold for each potentially affected model based on layer-wise parameter divergence, and (3) selectively replaces or remove contributions based on their affected ratio. FULClean can categorize and swiftly eliminate the impacts of poor-quality data from multiple participants on the global model. This can be accomplished without communication and utilization of the client's resources. Extensive experiments are also conducted on four distinct datasets with two different models to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of FULClean.}

	abstract = {Serverless computing converts services into multiple containerized functions, greatly enhancing the flexibility of edge applications. To guarantee Service Level Objectives (SLOs), it is common to pre-warm containers for all functions. However, we have observed that requests with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure commonly involve only a subset of functions. Pre-warming all containers may lead to over-provisioning, and the fixed optimization strategy for pre-warming becomes ineffective in scenarios where the calling probabilities of functions dynamically change. To overcome the above challenges, we constructed a dynamic DAG model with the consideration of function calling probability, aiming to minimize the request execution time. Based on the model, we proposed an Expectation-based Rounding Optimization (EBRO) algorithm to progressively find the offline optimal container perwarm and deployment strategy with theoretical performance guarantee. Then, we implemented an Online Pre-warming and Tasks Scheduling (OPTS) algorithm to adjust pre-warming and deployment locations based on real-time edge resources and container states. Finally, extensive experiments on a edge cluster show that, compared with baselines, EBRO has the lowest average request execution time and cold start time, with reductions reaching 78.4% and 88.5% respectively. OPTS can potentially reduce the request execution time by up to 25.2%, and reduce the cold start time by a maximum of 80.1 %.}

	abstract = {Industrial cyber-physical systems require dependable network communication with formal end-to-end reliability guarantees. Striving towards this goal, recent efforts aim to advance the integration of 5 G into Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, we show that IEEE 802.1Qbv TSN schedulers that are unattuned to 5 G packet delay variations may jeopardize any reliability guarantees provided by the 5 G system. We demonstrate this on a case where a 99.99 % reliability in the inner 5G network diminishes to below 10 % when looking at end-to-end communication in TSN. In this paper, we overcome this shortcoming by introducing Full Interleaving Packet Scheduling (FIPS) as a wireless-friendly IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler. To the best of our knowledge, FIPS is the first to provide formal end-to-end QoS guarantees in wireless TSN. FIPS allows a controlled batching of TSN streams, which improves schedulability in terms of the number of wireless TSN streams by a factor of up to  × 45 \\times 45 . Even in failure cases, FIPS isolates the otherwise cascading QoS violations to the affected streams and protects all other streams. With formal end-to-end reliability, improved schedulability, and fault isolation, FIPS makes a substantial advance towards dependability in wireless TSN.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has seen a growing dataset, an expanding model scale, and increasing applications in recent years. There is a notable trend of shifting DL training jobs from local computing units to powerful DL clusters built by cloud providers. These clusters allocate physical training nodes to DL jobs through a process referred to as multi-job placement. Existing multi-job placement strategies fail to achieve high efficiency in resource utilization, DL training, and robustness simultaneously, resulting in poor performance when resources are limited or when abnormalities occur in some devices. To tackle these challenges, we present CROP, an approach that performs efficient and robust multi-job placement in DL clusters. We formulate the efficient and robust multi-job placement problem as a non-linear program and prove its NP-hardness. To solve this problem, we present an effective submodular-based algorithm with a tight approximation factor of ( 1 − 1 / e 1-1/e ). We evaluate CROP on a small-scale testbed consisting of 8 physical GPUs and a large-scale simulation employing real-world job traces. Experimental results demonstrate that CROP achieves nearoptimal communication overhead while improving the training throughput of the DL cluster by up to  57.5 % 57.5\\%  compared to state-of-the-art solutions.}

Trust management provides a quality assessment by evaluating the trustworthiness of a service. Traditional evaluation methods do not consider the factors that determine trust in multiple aspects, while ignoring the stealthiness of trust-related attacks. To address these problems, we propose DSTrust, a deep spatio-temporal network-based trust evaluation model that aggregates trust from multiple dimensions and incorporates defence mechanisms at the embedded representation layer. Our model emphasises the contextual attributes of trust and performs local and global feature attention in temporal order. Experiments show that DSTrust outperforms other methods and guarantees the reliability of the evaluation under attack.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, checkpoints have been proven to be an effective solution to ensure slashability in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, and Tas et al.'s cutting-edge solution in S&P 2023 is a typical example. Unfortunately, despite progress, hour-level transaction delays and annually around 10 K dollar checkpoint costs make existing related solutions still unacceptable in realworld PoS applications. In this paper, we propose SecPoS, a slashable PoS consensus with second-level transaction delays and one-time checkpoint costs. To achieve these design goals, we draw inspiration from Pixel+ signatures and chameleon hash functions to design a novel bilateral blockchain structure, achieving twoblock transaction finalization via only uploading the first block of our chain as checkpoints. Next, considering practical application requirements, we address a series of following challenges, such as bilateral immutability, blockchain forks, determination of the main chain, and malicious attacks from PoS members. In detail, we propose two constructions of SecPoS, i.e., SecPoS – A and SecPoS – B. SecPoS – A and SecPoS – B have a tradeoff between transaction delays and block numbers packed in an epoch. Compatible with most existing one-way blockchains, we implement and outsource a prototype SecPoS to facilitate research11https://github.com/Academic-Paper-Codes/SecPoS-Consensus, and prove the security of SecPoS. Experiments on this prototype show that SecPoS – A and SecPoS – B require around 5s and 100s transaction delays, respectively, and both require 2 dollars one-time checkpoint costs.}

	abstract = {Deploying data plane programs across the network is typically formulated as a mixed-integer programming task, leading to a long execution time. In response, existing studies carefully tailor heuristics for specific task properties such as objectives. However, they suffer from poor solution quality under dynamic task deployment since they overfit specific task properties. Recently, generative diffusion models have been widely adopted in network optimizations due to their strong adaptability and generalization. Accordingly, in this poster, we propose a diffusion model-based framework for data plane program deployment tasks. Our key idea is to leverage the reverse denoising process of diffusion models to react to dynamic task changes at runtime while maintaining high solution quality.

	abstract = {Covert communication ensures undetectable information exchange between parties while posing risks when exploited for malicious purposes. Existing network covert channels face challenges in reliability, throughput, and stealthiness due to packet loss, limited capacity, and detectable anomalies. This paper proposes APCC, a reliable covert communication system that leverages IPv6 aliased prefixes for the first time, where secret data is embedded in the Interface Identifier field of IPv6 addresses. APCC enhances stealthiness through encryption and camouflage strategies (e.g., traffic blending and rate control). Additionally, it employs a reliable transmission mechanism incorporating sequence numbering, acknowledgment, and retransmission to mitigate packet loss and reordering. It ensures deployment flexibility across ICMPv6, UDP, or TCP protocols. Evaluations in real-world and simulated environments demonstrate that APCC achieves 100% accuracy under high latency ( 8 0 0 \xa0 m s \xa0 R T T \\mathbf{8 0 0 ~ m s ~ R T T} ) and packet loss (10%), with throughput up to 34.7 Kbps. Detection tests show APCC evades major intrusion detection systems (Snort, Zeek) except for Suricata's TCP alerts. We also propose mitigation measures to reduce APCC's potential negative impact. This work highlights critical vulnerabilities in IPv6 infrastructure while advancing robust covert communication methodologies for high-stakes scenarios.}

	abstract = {Efficient set representation and membership testing are important in high-speed network measurement. Fast insertions, space efficiency, fast query, and low false positive rate are the core requirements of traffic measurement, but existing solutions, such as hash tables and Bloom filters(BFs), cannot satisfy these requirements simultaneously. The state-of-the-art cuckoo filter and its variants(CFs) rely on the random eviction relocation strategy to resolve hash collisions, improving space utilization while reducing false positives and maintaining high query efficiency. However, CFs suffer a critical challenge in practical applications: insertion could trigger multiple evictions when all candidate buckets for an element are saturated, leading to insertion performance degradation, especially when space utilization exceeds 0.8. To solve the above problem, we propose a novel relocation strategy based on a random graph model, called the local minimum strategy. Our core idea is to use the implicit meaning of the number of evictions in each bucket as an indication to minimize the relocation of elements. We theoretically and experimentally prove that the eviction threshold for each bucket is  O ( log m ) O(\\log m) , where  m m  is the number of buckets. The threshold establishes the bounds for the probability of a successful insertion. The experimental results show that, the local minimum strategy significantly reduces the number of relocations by 67 %, as well as increasing the insertion throughput by more than 10 %.}

Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors. To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multinode distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.}

	abstract = {Emerging time-sensitive applications impose demands on bounded latency and jitter of network transmission, introducing their deterministic scheduling problem. There are mainly two types of methods for it, fixed rate limit based and hyper-period based, which still face challenges in scheduling performance and run time. We also noticed that flows may experience redundant queuing delay at some hops because of current methods' inability to distinguish them with different arrival patterns, increasing their end-to-end latency. To address the above issues, we present a method based on Differentiated Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding for time-sensitive flows' deterministic scheduling in large-scale networks, called DCQF. It provides fast and slow transmission modes at each hop and forwards flows in the earliest feasible sending cycles according to their arrival patterns. Due to employing a relatively simple scheduling model and relaxing flows' constraints by reducing their queuing delay, DCQF demonstrates higher computational efficiency and provides lower latency for flows in experiments, reflecting its feasibility and advantages in solving the deterministic scheduling problem in large-scale networks.}

	abstract = {Range Query (RQ) is to check whether there are any RFID tags with data beyond a given range. With about 46 billion RFID tags sold worldwide in 2023, time-efficient RQ becomes increasingly important for practical use, which can help users quickly pinpoint the target tags (if any) and give an early warning (e.g., fire alarm) to them for taking urgent actions and reducing the potential risk. However, existing work can deal with only a single range rather than multiple ranges that are very common in real-world applications. For example, foods in the refrigerator and the freezer have different temperature ranges for safe storing; treating them as one would probably give rise to query errors. In this paper, we study an under-investigated problem called multi-range query, which aims to achieve RQ in an RFID system with multiple query ranges. We propose a tailored protocol called anomalous tag identification (ATI) that quickly separates target tags from others and avoids querying all tags for saving communication overhead. In ATI, we design a fixedlength encoding vector together with standards-compliant select commands to deal with different ranges individually, without the need for any hardware modification. We implement the proposed protocols in commodity RFID systems. Experimental results show that ATI is superior to the baseline under different parameters, in terms of the time efficiency and space efficiency.}

	abstract = {Traffic classification has a significant impact on maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network. Since traditional methods heavily rely on feature extraction and largescale labeled data, some recent pre-trained models manage to reduce the dependency by utilizing different pre-training tasks to train generic representations for network packets. However, existing pre-trained models typically adopt pre-training tasks developed for image or text data, which are not tailored to traffic data. As a result, the obtained traffic representations fail to fully reflect the information contained in the traffic, and may even disrupt the protocol information. To address this, we propose TraGe, a novel generic packet representation model for traffic classification. Based on the differences between the header and payload-the two fundamental components of a network packetwe perform differentiated pre-training according to the byte sequence variations (continuous in the header vs. discontinuous in the payload). A dynamic masking strategy is further introduced to prevent overfitting to fixed byte positions. Once the generic packet representation is obtained, TraGe can be finetuned for diverse traffic classification tasks using limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that TraGe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two traffic classification tasks, with up to a 6.97% performance improvement. Moreover, TraGe exhibits superior robustness under parameter fluctuations and variations in sampling configurations.}

	abstract = {Efficiently managing data transmission across unreliable communication channels for diverse sources has attracted much attention due to its great practicability in the Internet of Things systems. Despite its significance in real-time wireless systems, ensuring stringent freshness requirements for each information source remains an understudied challenge, especially in scenarios demanding heterogeneous quality-of-service guarantees. In this paper, we study a scheduling problem of maximizing the accumulated information subject to different Age of Information (AoI) requirements for heterogeneous information sources. To that end, we first present a global optimal transmission scheduling policy when the source statistics are known a priori. Then, as this information is unknown, we formulate the problem as an AoI-constrained Multi-Armed bandit and propose an efficient learning algorithm, named O-SRS. Furthermore, we theoretically show that O-SRS achieves  O ( T log T − − − − − − √ ) O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})  regret while meeting the AoI requirement of each source. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical results.}

	abstract = {Network traffic measurement is critical for effective network management. Sketch has been proven to be a promising network traffic measurement solution. Considering the skewed distribution of network traffic, where low-frequency mouse flows dominate and high-frequency elephant flows are fewer, recent sketch-based solutions employ hierarchical designs to enhance memory efficiency and accuracy. However, these solutions inevitably introduce additional challenges, including increased memory access overhead, severe hash collisions between elephant and mouse flows, and limited adaptability to dynamic network environments. In this paper, we propose LA-Sketch, an adaptive level-aware data structure. First, LA-Sketch employs a level-aware classifier to intelligently map each flow to its corresponding level, thereby reducing memory access overhead caused by hierarchical designs and mitigating hash collisions between elephant and mouse flows. Second, we introduce an adaptive counter configuration method that dynamically adjusts the number of counters at each level according to diverse network traffic distributions, which theoretically minimizes overall hash collisions. Finally, to adapt to the continuously changing network traffic characteristics, we propose an adaptive online training method that enables LA-Sketch's classifier to maintain high performance using only sketch query values for training, avoiding the significant overhead of massive traffic data collection. Extensive evaluations on two real-world network traces across five measurement tasks demonstrate that LA-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art hierarchical sketches.}

	abstract = {Online data-intensive services (OLDI) are subject to stringent service-level objectives (SLOs), yet unstable server response times can result in increased Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) tail latency. Request cloning is an effective technique for mitigating tail latency by masking variations in service time. However, traditional static cloning suffers from performance degradation under high load, while the coordinatorbased dynamic cloning scheme introduces additional delays and scalability challenges. Programmable switches present the opportunity to replicate requests dynamically in the network to eliminate additional delays. Still, they face issues with inconsistent server states and inaccurate load perception, which could lead to server overload and queue head blocking. Moreover, congestion control schemes must be considered due to the replication of requests. To address these challenges, we propose RoClone, which combines real-time status updates and fast-responsive server state awareness with congestion control to alleviate server-side pressure. RoClone overcomes memory and access limitations in programmable switches, ensuring low latency even under high load. We implemented RoClone on a Barefoot Tofino switch. Experimental results demonstrate that RoClone significantly reduces tail latency across various loads and maintains low tail latency under high load. The system reduces the 99th percentile latency by at least 60 % compared to NetClone and by at least 40 % compared to the baseline.}

EPA lowers the upper bound of average queuing delay from 2T to 1.5T, and achieves T under perfect alignment.}

	abstract = {Network structures are sophisticated and hence vulnerable to errors. Link failures and traffic load fluctuations lead to complexity in network states. Different failure scenarios can result in varying network traffic distribution patterns. Meanwhile, the load on links within the same failure scenario dynamically changes with fluctuations in traffic. Network administrators are particularly concerned about whether links along the paths traversed by critical traffic are overload-free guaranteed when link failures occur. Yet, no attention was ever paid to overload-free property analysis for critical traffic. We propose Offaela, an efficient and accurate probabilistic analysis framework that verifies an overload-free property for critical traffic. We prudently formulate the problem and prove its computational hardness, then storm this fortification by proffering a failure scenario merging algorithm and adopting a randomized approximation method. Evaluations on real networks show that Offaela outperforms the state-of-the-art solution by 4.83 x and can provide availability analysis assistance such as identifying vulnerable failure scenarios.}

However, limited labeled data and modality heterogeneity on the clients pose significant challenges for effective federated multimodal model training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces FedAF, a novel alignment-augmented fusion framework tailored for federated multimodal learning. FedAF extracts unbiased and complementary information from multiple modalities with small data, enabling effective modality fusion and feature alignment for improving system performance. The framework introduces a three-stage strategy. First, FedAF utilizes labeled data to create unbiased anchor points, addressing disparities in client feature distributions. Second, FedAF employs a weighted enhancement contrast fusion scheme to improve feature clustering and reduce feature overlap. Finally, a multimodal semisupervised algorithm mitigates data heterogeneity and overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAF significantly outperforms baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in federated multimodal learning scenarios.}

	abstract = {Due to the exponential growth of blockchain ledger sizes, federated-storage which enables multiple devices to jointly store data, has emerged as a promising solution for secure data storage in edge computing. However, how to achieve verifiable queries in such decentralized storage remains underexplored. Existing broadcast-based query methods lack a verification mechanism for query results, making it impossible to ensure their correctness and completeness. Meanwhile, authenticated data structure based (ADS-based) query strategies are constrained by the full ledger data and cannot provide verifiable query services for users in a federated-storage environment. To this end, this paper takes the lead to propose EVQ, a verifiable blockchain keyword query scheme tailored for federated-storage edge computing. We propose a split keyword-based ADS as the core structure of our framework which ensures that users can verify the correctness and completeness of query results while alleviating storage pressure of edge devices. Specifically, the proposed ADS is constructed through a two-phase process: top-bottom keyword index tree construction and bottomtop RSA accumulator integration. Splitting the ADS based on keywords enables distributed data storage and the generation of corresponding ADS for the stored data. To reduce the query costs incurred by edge devices during query processing, we formulate the Keyword Allocation Optimization (KAO) problem and propose a gain-ratio-based keyword allocation mechanism to determine the splitting scheme of the ADS. The experiments are conducted based on the Foursquare dataset, which contains approximately 18 months of global check-in data collected from Foursquare. The experimental results show that, compared to the merkle tree strategy that also integrates the RSA accumulator, our EVQ improves query performance by 24.77 x.}

	abstract = {Touch switches are the foundation of a smart automation system that provides us with a seamless and intuitive interaction between users and smart devices. Typical touch switches and recent gesture sensing solutions suffer from some limitations including low scalability, low robustness, hardware modifications, and long time delay. In this work, we propose an RFID tag based touch switch called Tach that provides users with a battery-free, low-latency, low-cost, and plug-n-play touch-based input primitive, with no need for any hardware modifications. In Tach, we turn a passive tag as a touch switch and use the principle of impedance mismatch to sense the touch action by users. More specifically, we observe that when the finger touches the tag, the impedance of tag antenna changes. This change gives rise to impedance mismatch between the tag antenna and the tag chip, which further causes a frequency shift and a specific signal pattern. We design a continue wavelet transform based segmentation scheme and a dynamic time warping approach to achieve accurate and reliable touch identification in real scenarios. Additionally, multi-tag switches are discussed to support more user inputs. We implement Tach with COTS RFID devices. Extensive experiments show that the sensing accuracy reaches 96.5% with a low latency of 300ms, regardless of different users and environmental changes. The promising results might open up a new avenue in the design of touch switches in the near future. Code and datasets will be made available.}

	abstract = {IPv6 address correlation attacks determine whether two temporary addresses belong to the same user, compromising user privacy. Particularly, existing works have shown that methods based on TLS traffic analysis can be used to perform correlation attacks. However, they suffer from inaccurate differentiation of complex user behaviors and low correlation efficiency, leading to limitations in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a 6RIS model to improve IPv6 address correlation attacks on TLS-encrypted traffic. 6RIS learns the joint representation of interaction and sequential behavior from traffic, which is used to construct a KD-Tree for efficient correlation. Statistical aggregation and semantic preference modules are designed to extract generalized features from complex interaction behavior. To model sequential behavior, we utilize a sequence learning module to capture service dependencies, enhancing behavior representation. Experiments on a real-world IPv6 dataset show that 6RIS ( 9 1. 8 6 % \\mathbf{9 1. 8 6 \\%}  TPR,  0. 8 3 % \\mathbf{0. 8 3 \\%}  FPR) outperforms state-of-theart methods. The correlation efficiency of 6RIS improves by at least 57 % compared to existing methods. Additionally, we further confirm through 6RIS that persistent session IDs in TLS session resumption can directly expose IPv6 temporary addresses to correlation attacks.}

However, INT could cause significant telemetry overhead without an effective system design. Existing measurement systems attempt to reduce this overhead by employing fixed-frequency INT sampling. Nonetheless, these methods lead to frequent measurements of network ports with large flows while neglecting ports with small flows for extended periods. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight passive telemetry system based on INT, called INTSelection. The core idea is to use a flow selection algorithm at the centralized controller so as to measure all active ports. Compared with the current method, INT-Selection reduces the bandwidth overhead by 58.2% and 2.7%.}

However, existing tools are unable to simulate the situation under high traffic and suffer from excessive verification time. In this paper, we propose Monica, a scalable and efficient verification framework. Its key idea is to leverage the programmable switch to verify consensus algorithms. Specifically, Monica provides a set of primitives that researchers can invoke. Then, the control server recognizes the primitives and automatically configures the data plane. After that, the programmable switch collaborates with the control server to complete the verification. Experimental results show that Monica can generate traffic at the rate of Tbps level while keeping the computational and memory consumption of the programmable switch under 11.87%. Compared to existing testing tools, Monica increases the verification speed by up to 3.13 times. Further, Monica improved accuracy by 35.71% in high-traffic scenarios over other tools.}

	abstract = {Driven by the rapidly growing demands of modern applications, RDMA technology has been widely adopted in cluster networks, including high-performance computing (HPC) systems and datacenters. However, the high-speed, kernel-bypass nature of RDMA presents significant challenges for congestion control (CC). On one hand, since most RDMA operations are offloaded to the RDMA network interface card (RNIC), software-based CC struggles to regulate packet transmission effectively. On the other hand, RDMA workloads are dominated by short messages, making it difficult for both reactive and proactive CC protocols to manage congestion in a timely and effective manner, posing risks to network application QoS. Despite these challenges, proactive and reactive CC protocols each have distinct strengths, and combining them offers a promising research direction. This paper proposes an endpoint-network collaborative congestion control protocol (HNCC) that integrates proactive endpoint congestion control with reactive network monitoring and adjustment to achieve precise and rapid congestion management. HNCC introduces a novel reservation mechanism embedded within the RDMA protocol to prevent endpoint congestion while efficiently mitigating in-network congestion by dynamically adjusting the data injection rate based on network trend analysis. HNCC is offloaded to the RNIC, ensuring that its traffic scheduling is timely and effective. Extensive load testing across various scales shows that HNCC achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art CC protocols in datacenter workloads and reduces the average flow completion time (FCT) by 5 − 56% under HPC workloads.}

	abstract = {Waypoint planning is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, particularly for surveillance and monitoring applications. With the rapid development and deployment of UAVs, an increasing number of industrial UAVs are equipped with multiple cameras to enhance monitoring capabilities and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, a new type of camera supporting adjustable pan and zoom is emerging and rapidly being deployed. While UAVs equipped with multi-adjustable cameras enhance flexibility and precision in capturing dynamic scenes, they also introduce new challenges in optimizing waypoints to ensure efficient coverage and accurate data collection. In this paper, we propose WiPlan, which aims to determine the optimal UAV waypoints while dynamically adjusting the pan (horizontal rotation) and zoom (focal length) of cameras to maximize overall monitoring utility. This problem involves two coupled NP-hard problems, making it significantly more complex to solve compared to previous work. In tackling this challenge, we construct WiPlan as a two-level optimization problem. The results show that our algorithm improves monitoring utility by at least  1.73 × 1.73 \\times  compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, we test WiPlan using a real-world outdoor field, which includes 23 objects and a two-camera UAV with 7 waypoints. The results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully monitors 65 % of the maximum possible monitored targets, outperforming the baselines by factors of  4.25 × 4.25 \\times  and  15 × 15 \\times , respectively.}

	abstract = {Modern cloud hybrid storage systems have been concentrating on strategic data placement to provide low disk I/O latency for various workloads. However, previous studies primarily focus on exploring adaptive data placement algorithms with high placement accuracy, overlooking the computing latency introduced by these algorithms. It significantly increases the end-to-end latency that determines the quality of service (QoS) for hybrid storage systems. We propose ReHSS, a novel in-network data placement framework that optimizes the end-to-end latency for hybrid storage systems using modern SmartNIC. We first investigate the overhead of adaptive data placement for hybrid storage systems. Then, we propose a comprehensive hardware/software co-optimization solution based on in-network processing that includes algorithm acceleration, data transmission and processing, and computing and communication overlapping. Experimental results present that compared to the SOTA solution, ReHSS optimizes the end-to-end latency for hybrid storage systems by  1.54 × ∼ 15.18 × 1.54 \\times \\sim 15.18 \\times .}

	abstract = {AIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) enables diverse and high-quality content creation. Due to the computational intensity and high costs of model inference, efficiently scheduling generation requests is non-trivial for AIGC Service Providers (ASPs). A judicious balance is required between generation quality, limited resources, and service delay, while coping with online arrivals and operational constraints. Existing scheduling systems often neglect the quality metrics of generated content, and fail to deploy the latest architecture in model inference. To address these challenges, we introduce a distributed diffusion framework that reduces resource consumption by sharing inference steps across different inference tasks. On this basis, we establish a quality model using the refined CLIP Score, and formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. We first develop a prompt similarity-based algorithm to determine the number of shared inference steps within each request group. Adopting a primal-dual framework, we then design an online algorithm to dynamically manage request admission and scheduling, maximizing social welfare of the AIGC ecosystem while ensuring generation quality. Extensive real-world trace-driven experiments demonstrate that our approach improves social welfare by up to 38.2% compared to the state-of-the-art method.}

	abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across various domains, improving the quality of LLM inference services is essential. In this paper, we find that optimizing configuration parameters of LLM inference engines can significantly improve LLM inference performance in terms of latency and throughput. Therefore, we propose LLMConf, an automated performance tuning system that optimizes multiple LLM inference performance metrics by searching for the optimal configuration parameters of the LLM inference engine. We first introduce a knowledge-enhanced approach to identify the set of configuration parameters (LLMConfigs) that most significantly impact LLM performance from the adjustable parameters provided by the LLM inference engine. We then perform automated data collection to build functional relationships between LLMConfigs and each performance metric. Additionally, LLMConf employs a multi-objective optimization module to obtain optimal LLMConfigs for simultaneously optimizing multiple performance metrics. The experimental results show that LLMConf significantly outperforms existing methods. Compared to the default configuration parameters of the LLM inference engine, LLMConf achieves an average improvement of 20.1% across 7 key performance metrics. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLMConf has strong transferability across diverse datasets, varying concurrency levels and different LLM base models.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm of distributed machine learning, since it enables the collaborative training of machine learning models across multiple edge devices without compromising privacy. However, when deploying the FL framework in real-world scenarios, the global model is plagued by the aggregate loss issue, which can result in inefficient and unfair model training. Existing works in the literature either fail to ensure high efficiency in model updates or can not achieve fair model updates. Inspired by the art of “Less is more”, we propose FedBFO, a Federated learning framework with Bi-level First-order Optimization. The key idea of FedBFO is to treat model aggregation as the second optimization of local models, which utilize knowledge trimming to design a more tailored global model for each device. To this end, we first propose a knowledgeaware trimming scheme to adaptively aggregate tailored global models for local devices. We then present a anomaly-aware trimming mechanism to iteratively select qualified local models. The theoretical analysis shows that FedBFO can ensure the efficiency, fairness, and convergence of models. Experimental results demonstrate that FedBFO outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines with a 6.7x convergence speed than FedAvg, achieving better tradeoff convergence performance, efficiency, and fairness.}

	abstract = {Path-aware networking (PAN) enables endpoints to locally select end-to-end network paths based on path properties. This approach contrasts with the traditional Internet architecture, where routers determine the next hop towards the destination based on the routing information provided by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). By providing this additional transparency and control, PAN opens up opportunities to optimize path selection, with the potential to enhance network performance and user experience metrics. In this paper, we evaluate the potential benefits of PAN for enhancing end-to-end performance. We design Polaris, a concrete feedback-driven path optimization mechanism for PAN, and study its impact on Quality of Service (QoS) as compared to current Internet mechanisms. Our extensive simulation results show the viability and effectiveness of Polaris, revealing that it outperforms the current Internet mechanisms by an average of  4 2 % {4 2 \\%}  improvement in receiving rate and  8 1 % {8 1 \\%}  reduction in median loss, in the presence of background traffic.}

	abstract = {In the fields of ocean exploration, environmental monitoring, and emergency rescue, Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (Multi-AUV) collaborative systems require dynamic optimization of network topology to ensure effective operations. Underwater wireless optical communication, with its high bandwidth and low latency, has emerged as a promising solution. However, in dynamic underwater environments, such communication networks are highly susceptible to uncertainties, posing challenges to their connectivity and stability. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic networking strategy based on the Flexibility Evaluation Method (FEM). The strategy integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the robustness of underwater wireless optical communication networks (UWONs) through dynamic networking. This novel method, named FEM-NAS-RL, ensures network connectivity while improving the search efficiency of Multi-AUV systems. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct simulations, showing that FEM-NAS-RL algorithm improves network connectivity and task completion time by 23% and 27.8%, respectively, compared to existing methods. Additionally, test-bed experiments demonstrate the applicability and reliability of the proposed approach in practical scenarios.}

Existing delay analysis methods in network devices either oversimplify switch scheduling models or are dependent on traffic statistics. To precisely analyze the queue delay, we propose a new analysis method, which has two features: (1) incorporating switch-specific scheduling architectures and algorithms and (2) combining deterministic and stochastic parameter analysis. We take network slicing as an example to test our method. Experiments show that our proposed method reduces the average delay estimation error by over 80% compared to the traditional delay analysis method for network slicing and captures the actual trend.}

	abstract = {In fields like autonomous driving, strict constraints are imposed on the computing latency of deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks on edge servers. However, it is typical for edge servers to execute multiple tasks in parallel to serve multiple users, causing severe latency jitter due to resource competition, which seriously affects timeliness. Existing works ignore the computing jitter and regard computing latency as a deterministic value, failing to meet the timeliness requirement. To address this issue, we propose Malva, a framework for finegrained online pruning for DNN tasks, allowing flexible pruning at runtime based on jitter conditions. Specifically, Malva first partitions the DNN model into blocks and applies early exiting and pruning methods to create block variants. Then, the Malva scheduler flexibly selects the variant to be executed or exits early according to urgency and jitter conditions. Moreover, we propose a novel urgency-aware prediction strategy to estimate the accuracy impact of variants with incomplete pathway information during scheduling. Stress testing shows Malva can strictly maintain a zero deadline miss rate and significantly increase the stress required to cause the first deadline miss while still outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.}

In scenarios with priority flows, priority-aware sketch, as an emerging method, provides differentiated detection accuracy for flows of different priorities, optimizing resource allocation and improving the detection accuracy of high-priority flows. However, existing priority-aware sketches methods struggle to effectively handle the dynamic changes in flow priority skew in realworld detection environments, leading to wasted or insufficient storage space. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new priority-aware sketch with Dynamic Memory Allocation called DMA-Sketch. It dynamically adjusts the detection framework based on flow priority skew information and adaptively allocates appropriate memory space to each storage region. The experimental results show that DMA-Sketch improves the overall priority accuracy, high-priority accuracy and throughput by up to  1.33 × , 16.39 × 1.33 \\times, 16.39 \\times  and  1.88 × 1.88 \\times , respectively, under the scenarios with changing flow priority skew over the state-of-theart schemes.}

	abstract = {Large-scale cloud providers build geo-distributed regions to provide a wide range of services for global users. Due to the potential crash failures of hardware components, the availability zone (AZ) architecture has been proposed for fault tolerance. In practice, a region consists of multiple AZs and each  \\mathbf{A Z} \\mathbf{A Z}  runs independently. Considering the huge traffic volume and service diversity, how to properly deploy tasks for cost saving and QoS guarantee becomes a major challenge for cloud providers. However, existing task placement works often ignore the impact of crash failures, severely affecting users' QoS. And fault tolerance task placement works usually overlook other aspects of performance. Moreover, the AZ architecture has not been fully utilized in previous works. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes Azure, a cost-efficient task placement framework for fault tolerance and cost efficiency at the AZ-level. Due to traffic dynamics, we take a two-step approach: regionlevel task placement and AZ-level sub-task placement. For regionlevel task placement, we prove its NP-Hardness and propose an algorithm based on submodular theory with an approximation ratio of ( 1-\\frac{1}{e} 1-\\frac{1}{e} ). For AZ-level sub-task placement, we formalize the problem as a multiple knapsack problem with conflict graph, which has never been studied before. Based on threshold rounding, we propose an algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2. Extensive simulation experiments on real datasets show that Azure improves resource utilization rate by  \\mathbf{1 3 \\% - 5 3 \\%} \\mathbf{1 3 \\% - 5 3 \\%}  and limits the cost while meeting fault tolerance requirements.}

However, ensuring QoS for dynamic LoRA inference on heterogeneous devices is challenging due to memory contention from the shared LLM base model and KV cache. Existing solutions lack coordination between the KV cache and LoRA scheduling. We propose JointSerLoRA, a two-level inference system featuring: (1) a disaggregated architecture for KV cache consistency, (2) a global scheduler balancing adaptercache reuse and GPU load, and (3) a local scheduler with adaptive batching for prefix and adapter-aware grouping. Evaluations show that JointSerLoRA reduces end-to-end latency by 29 % and TTFT by  3.8 × 3.8 \\times  compared to state-of-the-art systems.}

	abstract = {Packet classification is essential for modern networked systems, the rapid growth of rule sets and strategies in SDN and NFV environments demands higher performance and better memory-efficient solutions than ever. Existing RFC-based approaches, such as HybridRFC, suffer trade-offs between speed and memory usage. This paper presents pRFC, a partitioningenhanced recursive flow classification architecture that improves classification performance while significantly reducing memory consumption. By introducing a prefix-length-guided partitioning strategy and a lightweight compression mechanism, pRFC mitigates cross-product explosion and reduces bitwise processing overhead. Compared to uniform partitioning, it achieves up to 16.86% lower memory usage and 34.19% faster construction. Evaluations on ClassBench show that pRFC reduces memory usage by up to 80%, accelerates construction by up to 97%, and improves throughput by  4.0 × 4.0 \\times  over standard RFC. Against HybridRFC, it achieves 72% lower memory consumption, 10% faster construction, and  2.45 × 2.45 \\times  higher software throughput. An FPGA prototype demonstrates that pRFC fits entirely within on-chip memory and supports 100 Gbps line-rate classification via pipelining. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of pRFC for large-scale rule classification in resourceconstrained programmable networks.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of networks, optimizing network utilization has become a crucial task. Consequently, previous research has extensively investigated Traffic Engineering (TE). However, these studies deeply couple TE systems with specific network topologies, resulting in a lack of generalization ability to different network topologies. Therefore, a trained model cannot be deployed to other topologies, causing additional training overhead for network operators. Moreover, these systems struggle to cope with changes in network topology caused by business expansion or network failures. Thus traditional TE systems can bring performance degradation under those scenarios. In this paper, we propose UniTE, a universal TE system. We leverage Graph Attention Network (GAT) and mask matrices to empower the model with the capability to manage traffic in diverse network topologies. To avoid the occurrence of loops along routing paths, we introduce Double Directed Acyclic Graphs (DDAG) to restrict the forwarding nodes for data packets. We train UniTE on various topologies and evaluate its performance. Finally, we assess UniTE's performance under network topology changes induced by network failures, and our method can outperform up to 15.6%.}

	abstract = {On-device continual learning (CL) enables lifelong and privacy-preserving learning for various edge intelligent applications. Increasing the number of model parameters as new learning tasks emerge is effective in ensuring learning quality but inefficient in memory cost, especially for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce InfiniCL, the first ondevice CL system that dynamically balances memory cost and learning quality. A key idea behind InfiniCL is elastic continual learning: selectively freezing layers in the expanding model and periodically distilling the model, preventing unbounded memory growth while preserving learning quality for new tasks. This novel CL paradigm opens a new challenging problem: how to decide the memory allocation of the model and data to achieve better learning Quality of Service (QoS) under the limited memory budget? To alleviate this challenge, we further propose a Bayesian Optimization-driven algorithm to jointly optimize layer freezing selection and data-model memory allocation. Evaluations show that InfiniCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse memory constraints, achieving 5.34-7.15% and 2.72-9.36% higher accuracy on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100, respectively.}

	abstract = {Source Address Validation (SAV) is a security mechanism deployed at network boundaries to prevent packets with illegal source addresses from crossing these boundaries. While SAV plays an important role in mitigating source address spoofing, its deployment across the global Internet remains limited. Measuring SAV deployment is essential for enhancing the understanding of the security landscape of networks. In this study, we propose a novel method for measuring SAV deployment based on 6 in 4 tunnels, complementing existing measurement work. Using this method, we measure inbound SAV for IPv4 and outbound SAV for IPv6, obtaining results from 12,417 and 2,104 Autonomous Systems (ASes), respectively. Based on our measurements, we analyze factors that may influence SAV deployment, including network address space size, AS type, and geographical location. Additionally, we provide a global heatmap of spoofable rates for networks in different countries and regions. Note that the measuring method using bin4 tunnels we introduce is not only applicable to SAV measurements but also holds potential for other measurement tasks, such as connectivity testing and transmission path discovery. This method offers a new way for large-scale measurement tasks across different networks, which may benefit future research.}

	abstract = {Intelligent traffic analysis, serving as a core enabler of QoS (Quality of Service) policies, plays a pivotal role in finegrained resource scheduling and mission-critical performance assurance. While SmartNIC-based data plane offloading effectively alleviates host processing burdens, existing solutions lack a unified traffic management capability, restricting them to packet-level classification or inference model acceleration. This paper proposes FlowAccel, an end-to-end hardware architecture for line-rate intelligent network traffic analysis in FPGA-based SmartNICs. FlowAccel constructs a hierarchical memory structure for real-time updates of flow state and per-flow packet length sequence. Its feature extraction pipeline enables parallel computation of traffic fingerprint features and incorporates a dedicated XGBoost acceleration engine for hardware-optimized model inference. Implemented on the Alveo U50, our prototype demonstrates a  1.08 μ \xa0 s 1.08 \\mu ~\\mathrm{s}  median inference latency under 100 Gbps network traffic. Compared with a single-logical-core DPDK software implementation, FlowAccel achieves a  54 × 54 \\times  latency reduction and  180 × 180 \\times  throughput improvement. In terms of accuracy, FlowAccel attains Macro-F1 scores of  89.0 % , 86.3 % 89.0 \\%, 86.3 \\% , and 92.4 % across three public datasets, significantly outperforming existing single-port 100 Gbps hardware offloading approaches.}

	abstract = {We are witnessing more real-time network applications that demand high transmission reliability and low delay, for meeting desired Quality of Experience (QoE). Forward Error Correction (FEC) is widely employed to combat packet loss, but its effectiveness depends on accurate packet loss rate prediction. Existing forecasting models exhibit limitations in handling multiperiodicity and complex variations, particularly in terms of trend prediction consistency and forecasting conservativeness, leading to suboptimal performance of FEC strategies. To address these challenges, we propose FitFEC, a Multi-Scale Dynamic Adjustment Transformer that enhances packet loss prediction and optimizes FEC strategies. FitFEC integrates Adaptive Frequency Analysis for capturing periodic components, Trend-Detail Decomposition Transformer for improving trend accuracy, and Dynamic Prediction Adjustment to control prediction aggressiveness. Furthermore, we implement an FEC scheme based on QUIC to further enhance transmission efficiency. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that FitFEC improves trend prediction accuracy, reduces retransmission rates, and reduces transmission latency, ultimately enhancing network performance and user experience.}

We quantify their tradeoffs in compression, computation, I/O overhead, and restore performance, revealing that (1) filtering large files ( > 64 KB >64 \\text{KB} ) preserves 80% of redundancy elimination at half the cost, (2) category-based reorganization reduces restore latency by 83%, and (3) fixed-size chunking with optimized blocks balances memory and compression.

Existing SLAM work cannot provide item-level semantic information for strong interaction with complex context. In this paper, we propose a brand-new solution called RF-SLAM that fuses the techniques of RFID and traditional LiDAR SLAM. A fusion algorithm is designed to pair each tag with target objects instead of locating tags directly, which addresses the problems of uncertain robot's motion trajectory, unknown antenna's position, ambiguity, and unknown tags' heights. The competitive advantage of RF-SLAM is that it can obtain the benefits of RFID and LiDAR and build an item-level semantic map of an unknown environment, with no need for any prior knowledge or system calibrations. We implement a prototype of RF-SLAM. Extensive experiments show that RF-SLAM can build an item-level semantic map with a high accuracy of 99.5 % when target objects are 7 cm apart.}

In this paper, we propose EQ-STAR, an optimal reachable path approach that combines encounter probabilities and energy to enhance network performance. First, the DySAT-pro model provides more accurate encounter probabilities based on the network's periodic patterns. Second, the Energy-Efficient high-Quality Markov Decision Process (EQMDP) model balances energy consumption and encounter probabilities to optimize the high-quality reachable path between the source and destination nodes. Finally, the next-hop relay node is selected based on the reachable path determined by EQMDP. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms classicial and state-of-the-art baselines in both realworld and synthetic datasets.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in computer vision (CV), necessitates distributed computing for efficient model training. Existing benchmarks often lack adaptability to emerging scenarios or focus on limited applications. To address these gaps, this paper studies a case on a comprehensive benchmark suite for distributed AI training systems. We classifies AI tasks into four categories, LargeScale, Moderate Complexity, High Load, and High-Performance, based on single-load computation and load concurrency, with representative models evaluated on Ray and DeepSpeed across diverse hardware. The experiments reveal fragmented framework performance. DeepSpeed excels in stability and efficiency for Large-Scale and Moderate Complexity tasks, leveraging advanced memory optimization. Ray outperforms in High Load and High-Performance tasks due to its dynamic resource scheduling but shows greater variability. These results highlight the need for task-specific framework selection tailored to hardware and performance requirements. We provides valuable insights for optimizing distributed AI training and bridges limitations in current benchmarks. Future work aims to expand task categories and framework support to align with the evolving demands of distributed AI systems.}

	abstract = {Person re-identification (ReID) in distributed surveillance networks presents significant networking challenges, particularly in coordinating multiple edge devices for real-time processing. While cloud-based solutions offer powerful computational capabilities, they introduce substantial network latency, hindering real-time performance in multi-camera indoor environments. To address these challenges, we present a distributed edge computing architecture that enables real-time person reidentification. Our system introduces two key networking innovations: (1) an  N N -frame feature matching mechanism that enhances identification accuracy at network edges, and (2) a dynamic load balancing framework that efficiently distributes processing tasks across edge nodes when network congestion occurs. As a foundation for this research, we introduce BNBUMTMC, a mixed dataset comprising both images and videos from multiple cameras, specifically tailored for indoor MTMCReID scenarios. Through extensive deployment in a university building environment with 10 cameras and multiple edge devices, we demonstrate that our system achieves high identification accuracy while significantly reducing network transmission latency compared to cloud-based approaches. Our experience provides practical insights into designing and implementing distributed edge computing systems for real-time surveillance applications.}

	abstract = {The emerging low earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet has gained worldwide popularity. Starlink, a prominent LEO satellite Internet service provider, has attracted the most users due to its low latency, wide coverage, and strong usability. Current research on Starlink primarily focuses on the space segment and its impact on network performance. However, as an essential component, the architecture and unique features of the Starlink Terrestrial Network (SLTN) are not well-explored, which significantly affects the performance, security, and development of the whole network. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting a thorough measurement study to profile the SLTN from various aspects and reveal its potential effects, with specific attention to the network assets, topology, and routing strategies. We developed a novel framework including active and passive measurement methods for collecting multiple network assets, tracing different route paths, and scanning active service of the SLTN. The open source intelligence was utilized for the first time to collect extensive real-user network status. Leveraging these techniques, we observed a rapid expansion of the Starlink service with the latest network assets, collected in January 2025, including over 23.5K/28 IP prefixes residing in 143 countries. We mapped the consistent topology of the global Starlink Internet access service and identified the specific IP addresses associated with the four types of network routing nodes. Multiple internal routing strategies were uncovered, which facilitate direct user-to-user interactions. Particularly, we revealed the switches of terrestrial infrastructure that users connected and the changes in routing strategies, which should be considered in future quality of service (QoS) evaluations. Our measurement also provides methods for improving users' perceptions and serves as a basis for studies like security risk evaluation and service discovery.}

However, existing wireless indoor localization systems suffer from deployment difficulty caused by model migration or extra infrastructure needed, and traditional neural networks fail to get good performance with poor quality data and labels. In this work, we overcome the fundamental challenges in pitiful data to achieve a low-cost indoor localization system using large-scale poor-quality crowdsourcing WiFi data - WiLoc. WiLoc constructs WiFi data into a hypergraph and acquires the topological relationships among APs based on a light-weight graph convolutional network. Then, it utilizes a modified transformer structure to learn the latent global-aware features according to the data quality and task demand. Finally, we implement the prototype of WiLoc in the real on-demand delivery scenario with merchant-level accuracy and evaluate its performance based on real datasets from couriers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WiLoc achieves an average F1 score of 85.03 % across various shopping malls, outperforming the baseline methods.}

While existing studies emphasize the computational requirements of non-linear inference, our findings reveal that linear computations can also significantly impact model speed, especially in resourceconstrained environments. In this work, we introduce MPCFLC, an optimization framework for secure inference models. Our innovative two-stage distillation process, which integrates matrix decomposition with non-linear substitution, achieves a  2.52 × 2.52 \\times  speedup in inference with negligible performance degradation. Furthermore, our specially crafted distillation method enhances distillation speed by  1.3 × 1.3 \\times , further minimizing accuracy loss. Experiments conducted on the GLUE dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.}

To address this, we propose HFHEMS, a novel method utilizing heterogeneous models and distillation to improve energy efficiency in HFL. HFHEMS employs dynamic model allocation to tailor computational loads to device capabilities and uses variable local iterations for real-time training adjustment. To preserve model accuracy, it integrates a dual knowledge sharing strategy with data-free distillation, enhancing knowledge transfer. Experiments confirm HFHEMS significantly reduces computation energy while maintaining robust accuracy, thus achieving a superior energy-accuracy trade-off.}

Experimental results and comparisons shown that the proposed method achieves higher bandwidth, lower latency, and reduced packet loss, with superior scalability, providing a computationally efficient, adaptive solution for future UAV swarm QoS optimization under complex dynamic topologies.}

	abstract = {Encryption is crucial for securing critical network infrastructures, including datacenter networks, 5 G networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In-network encryption (INE) offers a promising solution by enabling direct encryption of data on the network's data plane during transmission, thereby eliminating the need for host-side hardware encryption. However, existing INE solutions fail to fully leverage the processing capabilities of programmable switches, leading to low throughput, high resource overhead, and limited key flexibility. These limitations hinder their compatibility with other network functions and restrict their real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce NET-SM4, a high-performance secure encryption mechanism based on in-network computing. NET-SM4 offloads the highly secure and pipeline-optimized SM4 encryption algorithm to programmable switches. By employing a hardwarefriendly table lookup approach, NET-SM4 reduces computation dependency chains and supports parallel encryption inherently, thereby achieving high throughput and low resource overhead for in-network encryption. We implement a prototype of NETSM4 on a commercial Tofino switch and evaluate its performance through testbed experiments and a real-world RDMA-based case study. The results demonstrate that NET-SM4 (1) outperforms state-of-the-art in-network encryption solutions in throughput by up to 293.85 %, and (2) ensures link-speed data transmission with less than  20 μ 20 \\mu  s overhead in real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) services based on text-to-image generation tasks have driven change in the AI industry in recent years. Diffusion models are widely used in AIGC services for generating high-quality images from complex prompts. However, the process of generating diffusion models requires a large number of autoregressive denoising steps, posing significant challenges related to service latency and privacy issues, especially in resource-constrained edge devices. To further improve the quality of service (QoS) of edge AIGC services, we design a multi-edge cooperative caching mechanism based on the idea of reusing early intermediate results of similar prompts to reduce denoising steps. First, a collaborative filtering algorithm based on prompt similarity is developed to analyze user preferences. The designed multi-agent reinforcement learning-based cache management (MARLCM) algorithm utilizes the preference data as input and determines the caches that need to be replaced in the cache space. Secondly, we propose an adaptive edge server cooperation strategy that instructs servers to build efficient cache pools based on server similarity and workload differences. The experiment conducted on a high-resolution generation task with multiple diffusion cache frameworks shows that the proposed method reduces task latency by 23.1 %, and achieves up to 1.57 times higher cache hit rate compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {In heterogeneous distributed computing platforms, task execution containers (e.g., Spark executors) often have significant performance differences. However, most task schedulers greedily utilize resources based on the first-release-first-use policy. This leads to load imbalance across heterogeneous executors and poor application performance. To solve the above problem, we first construct a heterogeneous system task execution model. Then, we formalize the load-balancing task scheduling problem in heterogeneous environments as a minimum weighted executor waiting time problem and prove its NP-hardness. Next, a remaining workload-aware task scheduling strategy is proposed to address load imbalance among heterogeneous executors. Additionally, considering the startup overhead difference in executors, we introduce an earliest available executor wait mechanism to further optimize load-balancing. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed approaches using seven typical applications in two real-world heterogeneous environments. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our approaches not only improve cluster load-balancing but also achieve up to 35.5% performance improvement.}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel, network-topology-aware dynamic leader scheduling mechanism. This mechanism utilizes a system model to dynamically evaluate the system latency when the leader is located in different domains, incorporating real-time state information such as network latency, node distribution, and geographic workload distribution. Based on the evaluation results, the mechanism schedules the leader to the optimal domain to minimize latency. Experimental results indicate that it can effectively reduce system latency and improve system Quality of Service (QoS).}

	abstract = {The detection of Heavy Hitters (HH) of flows in a network plays a crucial role in a variety of critical applications, including network topology optimization, congestion control, and network security (e.g., DDoS mitigation). In high-performance data centers, tasks such as optimizing model training and detecting anomalies require microsecond-level granularity for burst and congestion detection, demanding higher accuracy and fine granularity in HH detection. However, existing HH detection schemes primarily focus on traffic accumulation over longer periods and ignore instantaneous flow rates, making them incapable of detecting short-duration heavy hitters (at the granularity of milliseconds to microseconds) that can significantly affect network performance. This paper proposes a rate-sensitive definition of HHs and introduces HeavyFinder, a framework for enabling efficient HH detection of flows at microsecond granularity and accurately describing their traffic changes. It detects HHs based on inherent characteristics of both traffic volume and instantaneous flow rates, and improves the existing elephant flow filtering mechanism. Furthermore, this framework provides an efficient information aggregation method for reporting HH information, which can reduce overhead further. We deployed and tested HeavyFinder on x86 CPUs and evaluated its performance by using real network trace data. Results show that HeavyFinder achieves sub- 1 0 \\mathbf{1 0} -microsecond accuracy in detection for the start and end times of HHs, with  3 − 10 × 3-10 \\times  lower reporting overhead compared to existing frameworks.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) brings computational resources closer to end-users by widely distributing the physical edge services, reducing end-to-end service latency at the network edge. Continuous operation of edge servers results in high energy usage and significant carbon footprints. Efficient resource management is essential for MEC sustainability. Recent solutions focus on demand response to reduce energy consumption. However, the reduction in available resources due to server shutdowns forces a degradation in the quality of service (QoS) provided to users, significantly impacting their quality of experience (QoE). Moreover, the non-linear relationship between QoS and QoE further complicates the issue. Therefore, maintaining user's QoE with energy consumption is critical to achieving sustainable edge services. To tackle these challenges, we formulate the QoE-aware energy saving (QoEES) problem and propose QESGame, a game-theoretical algorithm to solve this problem effectively and efficiently with a guaranteed convergence to Nash equilibrium. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that QESGame surpasses the representative approaches by up to 20.21%, 41.62%, and 23.54% in terms of the overall system benefit, energy saving, and QoE.}

However, this paper argues that heterogeneous information plays a key role in capturing complex interaction patterns between different account types and improving the classification effect of the model. Therefore, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous adversarial feature enhancement model (HAFEM), which screens out heterogeneous neighbor nodes through the similarity node ranking strategy, and combines the adversarial feature enhancement module to optimize the feature generation. Experiments show that HAFEM exhibits comparable or even better performance than baseline methods using only homogeneous neighbor nodes on the Ethereum account classification task.}

	abstract = {Microservice applications consist of complex API invocation relationships, where a single fault can propagate through multiple paths, leading to widespread failures. The diverse propagation patterns of different faults make efficient and interpretable root cause analysis (RCA) crucial. We propose CauseLens, a causality-based unsupervised RCA framework that improves both accuracy and interpretability. The key insight is that fine-grained causal modeling enhances root cause localization. CauseLens constructs a heterogeneous causal diagram at the operation and entity levels using normal monitoring data (i.e., metrics and traces) and trains a structural causal model. It then integrates reconstruction error and counterfactual analysis to identify root causes while revealing fault propagation paths. Experiments on two microservice datasets demonstrate that CauseLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RCA accuracy. Further ablation studies and parameter experiments validate its design, while overhead analysis confirms its feasibility for real-time RCA in production environments.}

	abstract = {The wide adoption of encryption network traffic protocols, such as TLS/SSL, poses great challenges in the detection and recognition of network traffic. Recently, deep learning techniques have been exploited to detect malicious encrypted traffic. While achieving good performance, deep learning models can be bypassed due to their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. There has been some work on generating adversarial traffic to evade deep learning-based systems, however, they fail to generate traffic that complies with network constraints and does not work in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a method that can generate legitimate traffic and evade deep models in practical scenarios. The effectiveness of the method comes from two novel designs. First, the perturbations are added to only the payload field to generate legitimate packets. Second, the perturbations are generated in a way that adversarial examples with different multiple of the perturbations can both evade the detection system. Thus, the traffic generated with our method can be restored while all previous works fail to do so. We further designed a joint training method to improve the evasion rate of the generated traffic. Experimental results demonstrated that traffic generated by our method can evade state-of-the-art deep learning detection models with an overall escape success rate of higher than 94 %.}

	abstract = {A dynamic perfect hashing index offers collision-free assignment for entries, ensuring excellent query performance, an essential metric for the Quality of Service (QoS) in database and big data systems. Its core mechanism is rehashing, which resolves collisions during insertions by reassigning entries to distinct slots. However, rehashing is costly, as hash collisions increase linearly with the number of entries in the hash bucket, and the exponential complexity of finding a feasible reassignment. Therefore, rehashing significantly limits the insertion performance of dynamic perfect hashing indexes. To this end, we propose PDPH, a hybrid approach that enhances insertion performance by combining static and dynamic perfect hashing techniques. Specifically, (1) PDPH leverages the complementary strengths of both techniques to reduce the rehashing complexity to a linear level, rather than the exponential overhead of previous approaches. (2) It further reduces the frequency of rehashing by enforcing multiple insertions to share a single rehashing operation. (3) It also limits the scale of rehashing by allowing partial rehashing operations. Evaluations on realworld datasets suggest that, compared to the state-of-the-art approach (MapEmbed), PDPH enhances insertion throughput by up to  2.32 × 2.32 \\times , while maintaining query performance.}

	abstract = {Swapping and purification are the two fundamental building blocks for multi-hop quantum networks. However, their interplay and its impact on end-to-end fidelity and cost are not yet fully explored. Existing scheduling algorithms address this problem under certain simplified assumptions and models that may not fully capture the complexities of real scenarios. In this work, we first consider more general assumptions that account for operation failures and extend a tree-based modeling approach for joint swapping and purification. Then, for the first time, we analytically prove the previous conjecture that the optimal strategy under Binary system is always to purify the entanglements before any swapping. This sheds light on the protocol and device design for entanglement distribution in quantum networks. We then further propose a tree-based algorithm, which can efficiently schedule swapping and purification along a path for both Binary and Werner systems. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method against the existing solutions, and the results show that our method uses fewer entanglements to establish qualified end-to-end entanglements and thus achieves higher network throughput.}

	abstract = {Flowlet-level load balancing has not demonstrated the expected robust capability in RDMA networks due to insufficient flowlets and the adverse effects of PFC. To delve deeper, we conduct measurements at end hosts and perform a detailed analysis of time gaps between packets. Our investigation reveals that in RDMA networks, the number of time gaps exceeding the flowlet timeout is considerably lower than the number in TCP networks. We also identify a stepwise time gap pattern that predicts the occurrence of PFC. Based on these observations, we propose  HF 2 T \\text{HF}^{2} \\mathrm{T} , a host-based time gap adjustment method to improve the effectiveness of flowlet-level load balancing in RDMA networks. The core idea involves delaying a minimal number of specific packets at the host, actively extending the time gaps between them, thereby fostering the generation of sufficient flowlets at the switch and enhancing the utilization of equal-cost links. Incorporating an identification algorithm for the time gap pattern that predicts PFC,  HF 2 T \\text{HF}^{2} \\mathrm{T}  also leverages the time gap extension to reroute traffic away from potential PFC paths in advance, thus mitigating PFC occurrences. The minor cost of delaying a few packets is vastly offset by the benefits of generating flowlets and reducing PFC. We use DPDK to implement a prototype of  HF 2 T \\text{HF}^{2} \\mathrm{T} , and through testbed experiments, we demonstrate that  HF 2 T \\text{HF}^{2} \\mathrm{T} , serving as a building block for flowlet load balancing, can enhance the throughput of CONGA by 16.82%. The simulation results also show that  HF 2 T \\text{HF}^{2} \\mathrm{T}  can reduce the average FCT by 16.38% and the 99-percentile FCT by 21.13% compared to the state-of-the-art RDMA load balancing ConWeave.}

	abstract = {Current web applications like social networks and video streaming have been generating magnificent traffic volume, along with intensive traffic dynamics, raising challenges to the fundamental infrastructure of web, i.e., datacenters. However, the traditional electric-based architectures are behind the curve due to the fixed topology and the demand-oblivious nature, failing to guarantee the performance of web applications. Motivated by the new traffic pattern, the reconfigurable technologies, like optical circuit switches (OCSes), are a promising choice to further improve throughput by dynamically adjusting connections when facing traffic dynamics. Currently, static and dynamic updating are two main methods for reconfiguring OCSes. Though static methods can acquire a solution with approximation ratio, it takes long running time and recourse. As comparison, dynamic updating can efficiently acquire a solution, yet existing solutions may degrade along with updates. This paper presents Talbot to further improve throughput with both approximation guarantee and low updating time/recourse. We formulate the throughput maximization problem as a fully dynamic k-weight limited matching problem which is  N P \\mathcal{N} \\mathcal{P} -hard, and we further propose an approximation algorithm based on level and lazy update scheme. To evaluate Talbot, simulations are conducted with both real-world and synthetic datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art works, we show the superior performance of Talbot.}

	abstract = {Federated learning has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, two critical challenges hinder its practical deployment: model performance degradation due to client drift in high data heterogeneity scenarios and communication gap due to varying client communication capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and propose Flexible Sparse Personalized Federated Learning (FSPFL), a novel framework that jointly optimizes model personalization and communication efficiency. FSPFL adaptively allocates local model sparsity while incorporating personalization mechanisms to trade off model performance and communication efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FSPFL significantly mitigates the communication gap, and outperforms existing methods. Our results show that FSPFL improves communication efficiency by up to  4.1 × 4.1 \\times  than the baselines while maintaining similar model accuracy in heterogeneous scenarios where clients have diverse data distributions and communication capabilities.}

	abstract = {The encapsulated route images provided by vendors hide detailed implementation codes of routing protocol, making it challenging to implement the same routing protocol on heterogeneous devices, as well as to locate and repair the configuration errors. While some works attempt to address the above issues, they fail in large-scale deployment, manifested in insufficiency in complex routing behaviors, lack of clear mapping between routing behavior and protocol standards, and difficulty in obtaining an open-source license. To solve all the problems, we propose RTB, a novel tool to mine the causality between network configurations and routing behaviors, in order to assist operations personnel in better pinpointing configuration errors. First, RTB generates test cases based on configuration features using a coverage-guided combinatorial testing algorithm. Then, RTB employs a differential network model to obtain differential datasets storing the correspondence between configurations and routing behaviors. Finally, RTB utilizes the differential datasets to create multilayer causal graphs, so as to reason about the implementation details and differences in routing protocols, which assists network operation and maintenance personnel in locating configuration errors. Experimental results show that RTB only needs 35.3 % test cases, and improves code coverage by 10 % over Metha. Moreover, RTB can mine the causality with 98 % accuracy, which is 5 % more efficient than existing tools.}

	abstract = {The LLM serving systems are increasingly growing in popularity, as they provide various capabilities ranging from realtime translation to AI-driven chatbots. Recently, significant effort has been made to optimize server-side metrics such as token generation throughput, while the optimization of token streaming is simply overlooked, resulting in excessive network traffic and poor network utilization. In this paper, we introduce user regions to relieve the network issues, since users from the same region (e.g., universities and business zones) are likely to share similar behaviors to access LLM serving systems (e.g., they are active in a period of time). In this context, we propose Libra, a proxy-cloud collaborative serving system, where the cloud generates and bundles the tokens in terms of user regions and region-based proxy extracts and repacks the received token bundle to their corresponding users. At its core, we design an online region-based task scheduling algorithm with a provable performance to optimize user QoE and system overhead over time. Our evaluations show that Libra outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (without user regions), such as vLLM, VTC and Andes, by up to  2.1 × 2.1 \\times  in the Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) metric and  78.4 × 78.4 \\times  in the number of packets. In addition, it achieves a 32.6 % reduction in TBT compared to other alternative algorithms (with user regions).}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of platform economy, as it effectively addresses the trust dilemma between untrusted online buyers and merchants. However, malicious platforms can misuse users' funds and information, causing severe security concerns. Previous research efforts aimed at enhancing security in platform payment systems often sacrificed processing performance, while those focusing on processing efficiency struggled to completely prevent fund and information misuse. In this paper, we introduce SecurePay, a secure, yet performant payment processing system for platform economy. SecurePay is the first payment system that combines permissioned blockchain with central bank digital currency (CBDC) to ensure fund security, information security, and resistance to collusion by intermediaries; it also facilitates counter-party auditing, closed-loop regulation, and enhances operational efficiency for transaction settlement. We develop a full implementation of the proposed SecurePay system [30], and our experiments conducted on personal devices demonstrate a throughput of 256.4 transactions per second and an average latency of 4.29 seconds, demonstrating a comparable processing efficiency with a centralized system, with a significantly improved security level.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) enhancement, resource management, and network security. However, the widespread adoption of encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) and the emergence of anonymous communication systems (e.g., Tor) have introduced significant challenges due to the presence of complex and varied network noise. Although considerable effort has been made to improve the robustness of the traffic classification, the performances of existing state-of-theart methods cannot be guaranteed in the presence of a mixture of noises, and are not stable in different application scenarios. In this paper, we innovate in proposing a network traffic classification method based on MoA (Mixture of Agents), namely MOTA. By leveraging a light-weight MoA architecture, MOTA efficiently fine-tunes mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to different application scenarios of traffic classification, and fully exploits the collaboration of the LLMs to ensure the robustness against mixed noises. Our extensive experiments show that, the classification accuracy is  ≥ 99 % \\geq 99 {\\%}  across multiple public datasets injected with mixed noises, significantly outperforming existing SOTA methods. Moreover, despite incorporating multiple LLMs, MOTA maintains millisecond-level inference latency on a server equipped with four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs, owing to its lightweight design.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification has become an essential technology for information service providers. While existing methods predominantly focus on packet-level features such as port numbers and payload content, they fundamentally overlook the dynamic interaction patterns revealed by traffic burst sequences and the inherent relational characteristics between consecutive traffic bursts. To overcome the limitation of existing methods, we design a new burst position relational graph attention network (BP-RGAT) for traffic classification. We introduce the Heterogeneous Traffic Burst Graph (HTBG) to obtain more traffic interaction information. We also incorporate Relative Traffic Burst Position Encoding (RBPE) to capture sequence information between bursts. To evaluate the performance of BPRGAT, we conduct experiments with ISCX-VPN and USTC-TFC datasets. The results show that BP-RGAT achieves the highest F1 score compared to existing baseline methods (e.g. NetMamba, ET-BERT, BehavSniffer, TFE-GNN).}

	abstract = {Blockchain enhances the robustness and user engagement of Federated Learning (FL) systems but fails to meet the throughput and real-time requirements for model transmission. While sharding architectures improve system throughput, the latency introduced by mainchain model transmission remains a performance bottleneck, compromising the QoS of FL systems. In this paper, we propose a Mainchain-Free Sharding architecture, MFSChain, featuring an adaptive sharding mechanism based on hierarchical clustering. This mechanism improves shard model performance by eliminating the need for mainchain aggregation (i.e., shard-level global models). We also introduce the Federated Learning State Tree (FLS-Tree) for client management and state migration without a mainchain, alongside a lightweight storage scheme, LiFLS-Tree. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that MFSChain outperforms traditional blockchain and sharding architectures. Specifically, MFSChain reduces client waiting time by 17% and 24%, increases average model accuracy by 2.5% to 10% compared to traditional global models, and boosts throughput by  464 × 464 \\times  while reducing transaction processing latency by 99%.}

	abstract = {In large-scale data stream analytics, accurate identification of Persistent and Infrequent (PI) flows is of great significance for monitoring and protecting against network attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). However, existing research focuses mainly on detecting frequent flows or persistent flows, with insufficient studies on the characterization and detection methods for PI flows. Based on the analysis of sufficient APT flows, we propose a method that combines global and local features to effectively characterize PI flows. Further, we propose a novel sketch algorithm called WisePIFinder, which aims to detect PI flows more accurately and efficiently in realtime. The key idea is to continuously filter out non-PI flows while detecting flow persistence, to achieve accurate statistics on PI flows. Experimental results show that WisePIFinder improves the F1 Score by at least 20 % and insertion throughput by at least 60 % compared to the state-of-the-art solution for detecting PI flows.

	abstract = {Multi-dimensional networks have become the standard for interconnecting GPUs to support large-scale distributed machine learning (ML) training, driven by increasing computational and memory demands. However, the inherent bandwidth heterogeneity across network dimensions poses a significant challenge in efficiently scheduling collective operations, such as AllReduce, to minimize communication time. Existing hierarchical approaches suffer from inefficiencies due to static or suboptimal pipeline structures with uniform-sized chunks. We propose HiPIPE, a novel solution for multi-dimensional All-Reduce collective communication, incorporating three key optimizations: chunk scheduling across all dimensions, adaptive chunk sizing, and dynamic chunk number selection. These techniques collectively enhance communication efficiency and maximize bandwidth utilization. Particularly, we formulate chunk size optimization as a linear programming problem to derive the optimal chunk sizes, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments using real-testbed emulation demonstrate that HiPIPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across diverse network topologies and configurations, achieving an average communication time reduction of 28.85% while sustaining bandwidth utilization of up to 98.11%.}

	abstract = {The growing reliance on cloud services has made availability critical for global business continuity. To mitigate disruptions caused by cloud outages, many large-scale applications maintain core functionality through multi-instance deployments. To support this, cloud providers enable cross-AZ deployments to deliver high availability. However, pursuing high availability must be balanced against cost efficiency, which presents three key challenges: electricity price disparity, application affinity requirement, and disaster recovery demand. Existing research primarily focuses on single-region optimization, often overlooking the potential benefits of multi-region deployment in cost and availability. While some works explore multi-region deployment strategies, they fail to address application affinity or disaster recovery requirements, resulting in low application availability. To address this issue, we propose CARD, a cost-efficient and availability-aware application deployment scheme in geodistributed clouds. Specifically, we formulates this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and designs an efficient approximation algorithm based on submodular function, achieving an approximation ratio of ( 1 − 1 / e 1-1 / e ). Large-scale simulations on realworld datasets demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, overall reducing costs by 20% – 50% and improving availability by 90% compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, such as Starlink, have become essential complements to terrestrial networks, significantly expanding Internet access in rural areas. However, their robustness in the face of various threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the impact of four critical factors—direct sunlight, solar superstorms, high workload, and wear and tear—on Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) failures and their effects on network routing performance. We systematically model these failure mechanisms and analyze their influence under three classical routing algorithms. Our evaluation includes both network-wide connectivity and end-user latency analysis. Our findings reveal that LEO satellite networks relying on static routing algorithms are highly vulnerable, whereas dynamic and distributed routing approaches exhibit greater resilience. While multipath routing enhances robustness through redundancy, it encounters two key challenges: throughput bottlenecks and performance degradation under high-latitude traffic loads. In contrast, distributed routing maintains resilience with minimal latency trade-offs. These insights underscore the need for adaptive routing frameworks that integrate spatial redundancy with traffic-aware load balancing to ensure reliable network performance.

However, the sensing data often face the challenge of missing values, which can impact the performance of subsequent tasks. Although some deep learning-based imputation methods perform well, they still struggle with insufficient training data due to high missing rate and long-term missing data. To address these challenges, we propose a Historical Data-based Diffusion Imputation (HDDI) method. Unlike existing deep learning-based imputation methods, we design a historical data supplement module to match and fuse historical data to supplement the training data. Additionally, we propose a diffusion imputation module that utilizes the supplement training data to achieve high-accuracy imputation even under high missing rate and long-term missing scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets, the results show that our HDDI outperforms baseline methods across four datasets. Particularly, when the data missing rate is 90%, HDDI improves accuracy by 25.15% compared to the best baseline method in the random missing scenario, and by 13.64% in the long-term missing scenario.}

	abstract = {The demand for 4 K live streaming has grown rapidly, driven by the desire for ultra-high-definition viewing experiences. However, delivering seamless 4 K live streams on mobile devices presents significant challenges due to mobile network limitations, including restricted bandwidth and upload capacity, which can lead to increased latency in broadcasting high-resolution video. Additionally, encoding 4 K video on mobile devices requires substantial computational resources, straining their capabilities. This paper presents StrongLive, a novel computation offloading framework designed to optimize  4 K \\mathbf{4 K}  live video streaming on mobile platforms. Specifically, StrongLive leverages advanced SR models to process the selected frames and utilizes decoding techniques to restore non-key frames by combining residual information with previously SR-processed frames. Additionally, StrongLive harnesses a GPU-accelerated video processing pipeline that seamlessly integrates decoding, upscaling, and encoding tasks, significantly enhancing processing speed without compromising 4 K quality. To adeptly handle scene changes, the StrongLive incorporates an online learning mechanism that continuously refines the SR model in real time, ensuring consistent perceptual quality across diverse broadcasting scenarios. We evaluate StrongLive on over 30004 K video clips under three typical network environments. Results show that StrongLive outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average reduction of 89.5 % in FPS violations and delivering high-quality  4 K \\mathbf{4 K}  live video streaming that meets user perceptual expectations.}

	abstract = {As network scale and complexity continue to increase, managing network configurations has become an increasingly challenging task. Existing configuration tools often depend on low-level, abstract intermediate representations, which require users to have substantial technical expertise. This reliance not only increases the learning curve but also heightens the risk of configuration errors. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for automating tasks across various domains. However, their applications to network configuration generation remain limited due to several challenges, including hallucination, restricted context length, and insufficient adaptability to domain-specific requirements. To address these issues, we propose ConfAgent, an advanced network configuration generation system powered by a multi-model intelligent agent. ConfAgent comprises four key components: a conflict detector, an information extractor, a routing algorithm coder, and a formal synthesizer. These components collaborate to accurately interpret complex configuration intents, detect potential conflicts, and generate robust code and network configurations through intuitive natural language interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the NetConfEval benchmark demonstrate that ConfAgent consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by margins ranging from 36 % to 100 %, particularly excelling in configuration tasks for large-scale network topologies.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G technology and the Internet of Things, the high-speed, low-latency, and massive connectivity capabilities have made cellular networks a critical infrastructure. However, IPv6 cellular address identification, crucial in cellular network measurement, remains a significant gap. On the one hand, the combination of IPv6 with 5G renders existing methods ineffective; on the other hand, the vast address space of IPv6 makes large-scale network scanning infeasible. To address this gap, we propose a novel IPv6 cellular network identification system, leveraging round-trip time and IPv6 interface identifiers to classify network connection types for / 48 prefixes accurately. Our method achieves an accuracy of over 99% on publicly available global datasets. Furthermore, by incorporating target generation scans, we have first achieved large-scale probing worldwide.}

	abstract = {While the P4-based programmable data plane supports flexible configuration regardless of specific hardware or protocols, potential software and hardware failures threaten its performance. However, existing tools fail to efficiently test and automatically repair faults, relying on time-consuming and error-prone manual manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose REP4, a system that automatically detects, localizes, and repairs bugs in programmable data planes. First, it specifies high-level intents to express comprehensive data plane functions and eliminate invalid paths in the control flow graph, thereby accelerating testing. Second, faulty P4 code and table rules are automatically located by employing taint tracking. Finally, REP4 updates the erroneous fragments through constraint-based repair and performs regression testing for validation. We deploy REP4 on real switches, and extensive experiments on open-source P4_16 programs show that REP4 saves nearly half of the test packets than existing approaches with 100 % function coverage and localizes different types of root causes in 55s in the switch.p4 without false positives, and automatically updates  P 4 \\mathbf{P 4}  code and table rules in 1.5s, with all updates successfully passing regression testing.}

	abstract = {Dynamic resource partitioning in multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) networks enables flexible, task-oriented allocation of resources. Existing approaches pose scalability challenges in jointly optimizing multi-type tasks while satisfying operational constraints. Traditional heuristic and integer programming-based solutions fail to coordinate heterogeneous task allocation, UAV deadline constraints, and hierarchical bandwidth quotas, leading to suboptimal welfare in dynamic environments. In this work, we investigate the problem of quality of service (QoS)-aware resource allocation in UAV networks, with the objective of maximizing social welfare. We design an online primal-dual algorithm to dynamically assign UAVs to tasks based on marginal prices. Our reformulated integer program captures UAV travel constraints, bidding prices, and task-specific bandwidth quotas alongside shared resource capacities. A complementary slackness-based dual framework guides real-time decision making on task acceptance and resource usage, with duality analysis establishing a 1-to-1 correspondence between dual solutions and primal allocations. Experimental results demonstrate 15 % welfare improvement compared to static allocation baselines.}

	abstract = {Large foundation models, such as SORA and GPT-4, have emerged as a mainstream and promising trend in the deep learning community. Many evidences have showcased that the training of these large models can be facilitated by leveraging vast numbers of consumer-grade GPUs from client devices, rather than relying solely on high-end GPUs in centralized data centers. Although previous studies have primarily focused on the technical aspects of client-assisted model training, the incentive mechanisms for this scenario remain largely unexplored. Insights from P2P networks suggest that a well-designed incentive mechanism is both catalytic and indispensable for the widespread adoption of client-assisted model training. In this paper, we explore the incentive design problem of client-assisted model training and envision a novel hierarchical procurement auction that captures some properties of client-assisted model training, such as asynchronous client arrivals, synchronous training processes, and complex resource requirements. We formulate the incentive design problem as a social cost minimization problem with  l ∞ l_{\\infty} -norm constraints and transform it into an approximation problem with an  l 2 l_{2} -norm objective function which facilitates the design of an efficient approximation algorithm. Subsequently, we propose a primal-dual approximation algorithm for client selection and payment allocation, which guarantees a small competitive ratio and truthfulness. Both theoretical studies and experiments using real-world trace data are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.}

To address this issue, this paper proposes FlowGram, a measurement framework to provide flow frequency estimation services for cloud tenants. FlowGram provides a user-friendly interface for tenants and automatically adjusts the memory allocation to meet the tenants' demands. In the data plane, FlowGram employs sketches on programmable switches to perform the measurement. In the control plane, FlowGram utilizes a precise error model of sketches and an efficient memory allocation algorithm that ensures the measurement errors are within the specified error bounds. We prototype FlowGram on programmable switches and commodity servers and conduct comprehensive experiments. Experiment results demonstrate that FlowGram outperforms the state-of-the-art system, achieving a 14 % higher task satisfaction rate while utilizing the same amount of resources.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous networks utilize devices from multiple vendors to enhance failure prevention, but also pose challenges in network device management. Network configuration translation, as a critical aspect of management, facilitates the upgrading of pairwise nodes that back up each other and device replacements across different vendors. Manually translating configuration requires a significant amount of time and demands that administrators have ample experience. To address this, we introduce the Network Configuration Translation MultiAgent System (NetMAS), designed to manage heterogeneous manuals and streamline configuration translation. By efficiently handling diverse manuals, NetMAS simplifies the translation of network configurations across different devices and vendors. NetMAS consists of three core components: a hierarchical manual retriever, a detachable network configuration translator, and a memory module. Leveraging the advanced function-calling capabilities of the Large Language Models, NetMAS eliminates the need for external training, significantly enhancing overall efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that NetMAS can effectively retrieves configuration manuals. The retrieval accuracy reaches 94.11% when considering the top-5 results. Furthermore, it supports manuals from various vendors and devices. When translating from Cisco to Huawei, H3C, and Juniper, NetMAS improves accuracy by an average of  25.48 × 25.48 \\times  and  12.38 × 12.38 \\times , respectively, compared to directly using GPT-4o and Deepseek.}

	abstract = {Screen-camera communication enables the seamless integration of encoded auxiliary information from the digital world into the physical domain—allowing users to obtain detailed information about an object of interest, such as a poster, simply by capturing a photo with a smartphone. Traditional screencamera communication methods, such as barcodes, occupy visual space and degrade aesthetics. While inter-frame encoding methods address these limitations, they are restricted to video streams or active screen displays. To enable content-preserving intraframe screen-camera communication, we propose InvisiCode, a noise-aware method for imperceptible, robust, and high-capacity encoding. We first quantitatively analyze screen-camera noise and identify predictable patterns in mid-high frequency Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, enabling mathematically bounded, noise-aware encoding. Based on this insight, we design an adaptive encoding algorithm that distributes data across multiple coefficients, balancing imperceptibility and resilience to noise. To ensure accurate decoding, we enhance  U 2 \\mathrm{U}^{2} -Net with Edge-Constraint Loss to improve boundary detection and precisely locate the encoded region in captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that InvisiCode is reliable and adaptable across various screen and camera configurations, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop monitors. It achieves a throughput of 784 bits per frame with a Bit Error Rate (BER) of less than 0.05, significantly outperforming previous methods. User studies confirm that the system introduces imperceptible distortion. Our code and demo are available at https://github.com/haikuoY/InvisiCode.}

	abstract = {To comply with the “right to be forgotten,” recent research has introduced machine unlearning techniques that enable machine learning models to remove specific data samples. However, existing multimodal machine unlearning has concerns about efficiency, and the model fidelity may deteriorate after unlearning, leading to meaningless outputs if given data samples that are requested to be forgotten. Instead of focusing on datalevel machine unlearning, we focus on information-level unlearning, aiming to forget specific information of data samples (such as sensitive information involving name or medical condition) while maintaining the model fidelity. In this work, we design an efficient multimodal machine unlearning (EMMU) framework to address model fidelity in vision-language systems. The core idea is to locate and only modify model parameters that are highly correlated with the specific information (which requires forgetting). EMMU locates crucial parameters associated with the sensitive information and updates these parameters using a multiobjective optimization strategy. Evaluations on vision-language tasks, such as Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, using multiple datasets, demonstrate the efficiency and fidelity of EMMU. Compared to existing methods, our method obtains an average of  111 × 111 \\times  improvement, boosting efficiency up to  1445 × 1445 \\times . Meanwhile, the average utility-forget balance score has improved  9 × 9 \\times  on average and reached up to  70 × 70 \\times , across multiple models and datasets.}

	abstract = {State machines are essential for enhancing protocol analysis to identify vulnerabilities. However, inferring state machines from network protocol implementations is challenging due to complex code syntax and semantics. Traditional dynamic analysis methods often miss critical state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis faces path explosion issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel state machine inference approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), named ProtocolGPT. This method employs retrieval augmented generation technology to enhance a pre-trained model with specific knowledge from protocol implementations. Through effective prompt engineering, we accurately identify and infer state machines. To the best of our knowledge, our approach represents the first state machine inference that leverages the source code of protocol implementations. Our evaluation of six protocol implementations shows that our method achieves a precision of over 90 %, outperforming the baselines by more than 30 %. Furthermore, integrating our approach with protocol fuzzing improves coverage by more than 20 % and uncovers two 0-day vulnerabilities compared to baseline methods.}

	abstract = {The advent of a large language model (LLM) has revolutionized various domains and services. The inference pipeline system is emerging as an efficient mechanism to deploy LLMs. However, existing works barely study the deployment of LLM inference on heterogeneous GPUs (with different computation and memory capabilities), where inference efficiency can be heavily affected by the imbalanced performance of different pipeline stages. Based on our empirical experience, the unbalanced pipeline stages incur GPU wait time, and average idle time can exceed 50% of the whole LLM inference process. In this paper, we study and optimize the distributed pipeline parallelism system for LLM inference on heterogeneous GPUs. We present a heuristic algorithm and implement a system that automatically deploys an efficient inference pipeline on heterogeneous GPUs. Extensive experiments are evaluated on 26 heterogeneous GPUs. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system, which improves makespan (i.e., the total LLM inference latency) and throughput by an average of 37.1% and a maximum of 83.0% compared to the baselines.}

	abstract = {Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) rely heavily on caching algorithms to minimize content delivery latency and optimize network performance. While machine learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions for handling complex request patterns in caching systems, current learningbased caching methods face critical limitations in processing granularity and operational efficiency. Existing approaches either process requests in coarse-grained time windows or struggle with throughput bottlenecks during object-level operations. To address these challenges, we present UniCache, a novel batchlevel content caching algorithm that balances processing granularity and system efficiency. UniCache introduces a Batch Queue architecture coupled with specialized Batch-level Inference components, enabling high-throughput processing while providing fine-grained request information. This design prevents both suboptimal caching decisions and request accumulation delays during prediction phases. Furthermore, UniCache overcomes the common limitation of treating admission and eviction policies as separate entities, by implementing a unified model that jointly optimizes both processes based on object popularity patterns. The integration of tiered cache storage enhances the system's resilience to prediction inaccuracies while facilitating effective identification and retention of popular objects. Experimental evaluation on Wiki CDN and Tencent Photo datasets demonstrates that UniCache achieves  1 2 % ∼ 5 3 % \\mathbf{1 2 \\%} \\sim \\mathbf{5 3 \\%}  improvement in Object Hit Ratio (OHR) compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent a cost-effective and potent threat to network stability. While extensively studied in IPv4 networks, DDoS implications in IPv6 remain underexplored. The vast IPv6 address space renders brute-force scanning and amplifier testing for all active addresses impractical. Innovatively, this work investigates ASlevel vulnerabilities to reflection amplification attacks in IPv6. One prerequisite for amplification presence is that it is located in a vulnerable autonomous system (AS) without inbound source address validation (ISAV) deployment. Hence, the analysis focuses on two critical aspects: global detection of ISAV deployment and identification of amplifiers within vulnerable ASes. Specifically, we develop a methodology combining ICMP Time Exceeded mechanisms for ISAV detection, employ IPv6 address scanning for amplifier identification, and utilize dual vantage points for amplification verification. Experimental results reveal that 4,460 ASes (61.36% of measured networks) lack ISAV deployment. Through scanning approximately 47 M active addresses, we have identified reflection amplifiers in 3,507 ASes. The analysis demonstrates that current IPv6 networks are fertile ground for reflection amplification attacks, alarming network security.}

	abstract = {Existing delay-based congestion control algorithms such as Vegas and Copa can effectively achieve low latency only in scenarios where the number of flows is relatively small. In this paper, we design a novel low delay congestion control (LDCC) algorithm for the Internet to achieve minimal low latency while maintaining high throughput. The LDCC framework first adopts a neural network to predict the current queue length, leveraging all relevant information carried via TCP. Then, we design a source-side algorithm dynamically adjusting the congestion window with the predicted queue length as a congestion signal while keeping the queue length low. We further present a fluid model for the performance analysis of LDCC. Our steady-state analysis reveals that the bottleneck queue length is proportional to the square root of the number of flows  ( N − − √ ) (\\sqrt{N}) . In contrast, the bottleneck queue length of other delay-based congestion control algorithms such as Vegas and Copa is much large and proportional linearly to the number of flows ( N N ). The advantage of LDCC becomes more significant as the number of flows increases. Both real-world experiments and simulations validate the effectiveness of LDCC. Compared with the latest delay-based congestion control algorithm Copa+, when the number of flows increases from 10 to 1000, the queue delay of LDCC is reduced by 70 % to 91 %.}

	abstract = {In the erasure-coded storage systems, multiple related blocks have to be retrieved from other surviving nodes to repair a failed block. This incurs significant communication overhead with the surging scale of distributed storage systems. To mitigate the bandwidth bottleneck, in-network repair (INR) has emerged as a promising transport paradigm, which migrates the aggregation operations from the repair node to the programmable hardware, such as Intel Tofino switches. However, due to the limited on-chip memory size of these switches, the INR can degrade to the most primitive incast-type transmission, leading to massive traffic volume and hindered repair throughput. While we notice that, there are spare CPU cores in the storage servers that can be leveraged as alternative computing resources. With this intuition, we propose SINA, a Server-assisted In-Network repair Acceleration framework in this paper, which leverages the spare servers to assist aggregation operations when the programming switches' memory size is scarce for failure repair. We formulate this problem by adjusting the aggregation modes across the involved racks and solve this NP-hard problem using the Gurobi optimization solver. For all we know, this is the first work exploring spare servers for assisting the memory-scarce INR in erasure-coded storage systems. We have implemented SINA on an FPGA-based prototype system, and the experimental results show that SINA can ensure fault tolerance and accelerate failure repair by  5.0 × 5.0 \\times  compared to the conventional methods.}

	abstract = {Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an energy-efficient consensus where proposer election based on validator stakes causes centralization, especially in stake pools. However, existing reward allocation mechanisms aim to address centralization but increase the risk of Sybil attacks. Therefore, designing a reward allocation mechanism for stake pools that reconciles decentralization and Sybil resilience remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose Dream-SR, a reward allocation mechanism established with formal function properties. Dream-SR enhances decentralization by imposing reward constraints to limit the dominance of large stake pools. Sybil resilience is ensured by aligning reward allocation with both the economic incentives and the influence, effectively addressing utility-maximizing and influence-maximizing Sybil attacks. Furthermore, we leverage a multi-leader-multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game model to capture the interactions between validators and users regarding commission pricing and stake delegation within stake pools. The game model is used to analyze the impact of the reward allocation mechanism on the strategies of participants and the system equilibrium. Compared with other relevant mechanisms, numerical results reveal that Dream-SR effectively improves decentralization and resilience to Sybil attacks at equilibrium.}

	abstract = {Network device misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities and operational failures. Existing validation methods primarily rely on program analysis or machine learning, which are often labor-intensive and data-sensitive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text analysis, their direct application to configuration validation faces challenges such as limited domain knowledge, hallucinations, and non-interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ConfigChecker, an automated network configuration validation system that integrates LLMassisted structured knowledge extraction with knowledge graphbased reasoning. ConfigChecker involves two key phases: (1) Knowledge Graph Construction - We construct three instructiontuning datasets (EV, PG, and RE) to fine-tune LLMs for structured command information extraction, including view transitions, parameter constraints, and inter-command dependencies. The extracted knowledge is stored in a knowledge graph, providing a foundation for configuration validation. (2) Configuration Validation - A graph-based command validator ensures syntax and semantic correctness, while knowledge graph reasoning and indexing mechanism are used to detect inter-command dependency violations. We evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs for structured knowledge extraction, achieving up to 90% accuracy on the EV and RE datasets. Additionally, our system shows a 9%-20% improvement in validation accuracy compared to three mainstream large models. Furthermore, the average response time per configuration line remains below 15 milliseconds. Results demonstrate that ConfigChecker significantly enhances validation accuracy and efficiency, providing a novel integration of LLMs and knowledge graphs for automated configuration validation.}

	abstract = {In online communities, trolling disrupts constructive discussion, fuels conflicts, and even triggers offline violence. While many defense techniques assume trolling arises from endogenous user behavior, our research unveils a different dimension: attackers control a group of accounts through hacking or payoffs, and intentionally sow discord by posting specifically designed statements. This attack is considered as a hijacking-based troll attack. Based on the Fridkin-Johnson opinion dynamics model, we formalize how such attacks propagate and accordingly propose Sedative, a real-time defense framework grounded in the concept of attraction basins in complex systems. Sedative identifies and protects structurally and dynamically critical nodes that constitute the backbone of the stable attraction basin to constrain perturbation spread under limited defense budgets. By focusing on localized, real-time influence rather than global computation, Sedative achieves high scalability and responsiveness. Experiments on real and synthetic networks show that Sedative suppresses up to 98 % of attack-induced conflict, significantly outperforming the baselines.}

	abstract = {Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training among geo-distributed participants, each with different features of the same samples, but only one party possesses the labels. Communication delays between active and passive parties in VFL significantly hinder its training efficiency. Existing VFL methods adopt asynchronous schemes or multiple local updates per communication round, but they either introduce heavy computation overhead or fail to adapt to dynamic network conditions. This work proposes PASTA, a novel framework employing Adaptive Pipeline Parallelism with Staleness Control for VFL, designed to mitigate these delays and balance training efficiency and model performance. PASTA enables concurrent communication and computation, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing idle time by strategically using stale gradients. Each passive party can send one or more batches of embeddings per communication and conduct stale local training, so that computation times can overlap with communication latency. Since staleness impedes model accuracy despite its benefits in reducing time, a dynamic feedback-based mechanism is proposed to adjust the numbers of embeddings sent and local training iterations based on system heterogeneity. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that PASTA significantly enhances convergence speed by  1.8 × 1.8 \\times  to  4.6 × 4.6 \\times  compared to leading VFL systems, without compromising final accuracy.

	abstract = {With the increase in computing speed and network bandwidth in data centers, microsecond-level tail latency has become a key metric for internet-based online services. However, the tail latency of messages in data centers is mainly determined by queuing delay, which is usually much larger than pure message transmission time. Existing traffic scheduling mechanisms fail to effectively coordinate end-side and in-network resources, leading to head-of-line (HOL) blocking for microsecond-level messages at both ends and switches, which severely impacts the tail latency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a network-wide Global Priority based Multi-Path message scheduling mechanism GPMP. It assigns the highest priority to microsecond-level messages at both ends and swtiches to ensure such messages can quickly acquire resources and complete quickly. Furthermore, GPMP also optimizes the transmission of low-priority large messages by introducing a multi-path method, which effectively reduces transmission time and improves the bandwidth utilization. Extensive simulation results show that GPMP not only meets the strict latency requirements of microsecond-level messages, but also significantly reduces the completion time of long messages, leading to an overall improvement in bandwidth utilization.}

	abstract = {Monitoring the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of video conferencing is critical for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to ensure user satisfaction. However, a significant technical challenge arises: MOS is a subjective measure, while ISPs primarily rely on deep packet inspection (DPI) data for performance monitoring, making direct mapping between MOS and DPI data nearly impossible. To address this gap, we develop DePI-MOSE, a novel solution that leverages sub-application-level video context clues to build machine-learning models. By inferring the type of end devices and identifying the motion level within video content during a conference session, DePI-MOSE can estimate MOS values from DPI data accurately. We implemented and tested DePI-MOSE in a real-world ISP network, and experimental results show that DePI-MOSE is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. We also built a network resource management platform for ISPs to dynamically adjust users' network resources by precisely monitoring users' video conferencing QoE.}

	abstract = {Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a fundamental technology for enabling deterministic communication in industrial Internet applications. Existing TSN traffic scheduling research primarily focuses on optimizing the scheduling of timetriggered (TT) flows to ensure low-delay transmission for these periodic and time-sensitive flows. However, another critical class of traffic exists in TSN that has received little attention-eventtriggered (ET) flows, such as sensor exception alarms. Unlike TT flows, ET flows exhibit higher time sensitivity and demand rapid response to ensure system security. Despite their importance, ET flows have been largely overlooked in prior studies. A few works only have explored dynamically expanding scheduling windows or sharing time slots to accommodate ET flows. However, these approaches treat ET flows as isolated events, neglecting the causal relationships between them. This oversight results in inefficient and unreliable ET flow transmission. To address this limitation, we propose GP-TSN, an event-triggered traffic scheduling framework based on causal inference. Firstly, GP-TSN introduces a Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention-based Hawkes Process (SGATPP) to model and mine event relationships, enabling the inference of future ET flows. Secondly, GP-TSN employs a geometric abstraction-based scheduling strategy to allocate slots for the inferred ET flows, ensuring compliance with TT/ET flow constraints. Additionally, a slot recycling mechanism is incorporated to minimize resource waste. By leveraging the causal dependencies among ET flows, GP-TSN enhances scheduling efficiency and improves the reliability of ET flow transmission. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that SGATPP achieves superior event inference accuracy (F1-score up to 62.25 %). Moreover, under the condition of ensuring the transmission performance of TT flows, GP-TSN increases the number of ET flows transmitted with the minimum end-to-end delay by 1.7 to 9.7 x.}

	abstract = {With the growth of large-scale multimodal data and advancements in neural networks (NNs), cross-modal retrieval (CMR) relies on outsourced computation for efficiency and scalability. Existing privacy-preserving CMR approaches under the fully outsourced setup typically employ traditional machine learning models or simple NNs due to the limitations of privacypreserving techniques. It results in significant performance gaps in efficiency and accuracy compared to plaintext CMR. In this paper, we present PP-DACMR, a privacy-preserving deep adversarial hashing approach for cross-modal retrieval. With the paradigm of secure two-party computation, PP-DACMR employs a lightweight technique, additive secret sharing (ASS), to safeguard multimodal data and NNs. A series of ASS-based protocols are designed specifically for CMR based on GAN architecture, supporting in-the-cloud training and querying. Moreover, we optimize two generic secure arithmetic protocols for truncation and matrix multiplication, which are fundamental to PP-DACMR, contributing to improved performance. We conduct experimental evaluations over real-world multimodal datasets and compare PP-DACMR to the state-of-the-art approach PPCMR. The results demonstrate PP-DACMR outperforms PPCMR, achieving an improvement on the average mAP of 11.73% and being 5.3× faster.}

	abstract = {Binary Neural Network (BNN) is a meaningful machine learning model on the data plane. However, due to the chip limitations, the scalability, especially the number of hidden layers in one pipeline, is limited. For better inference performance, existing methods reuse the hidden layers through packet recirculations. Recirculations lead to poor processing latency. Additionally, the simplified operations in the in-network BNN model restrict the flexibility of itself, which results in the unarbitrary input length of neurons for more the additional resource consumption than normal BNN model. In this paper, we present TBNN, an optimized in-network BNN model that achieves both scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates deployment constraints while maximizing hardware utilization, advancing the feasibility of complex BNN models on resourcelimited data planes. By replacing computational bottleneck actions with Lookup Tables (LUTs), TBNN enables at most  4 × 4 \\times  more neurons per pipeline and reduces per-packet latency by 50% through minimized recirculation. LUT-based implementation supports pruning operations, trading an accuracy loss of  1. 6 9 % \\mathbf{1. 6 9 \\%}  for saving about  2 4 % \\mathbf{2 4 \\%}  instructions.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the smart Internet of Things (IoT), with widespread applications in inference tasks like interactive games, intelligent driving, and augmented reality. Along with these promising applications, various task-offloading methods were proposed to improve the utilization of system resources, given that DNN model inference typically requires substantial computational power. However, existing offloading methods focus primarily on a specific model, and research addressing heterogeneous DNN models (with different structures and layers) remains limited in practical IoT environments. Directly integrating these methods would require frequent re-initialization to adapt to changes in the search space during the offloading of mixed heterogeneous DNN inference tasks, resulting in insufficient flexibility and the waste of computational resources. Thus, we propose AutoCut, a global heterogeneous model offloading service based on a customized multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, to find low-latency and energyefficient offloading partitions. AutoCut utilizes a group-layer granularity partitioning that avoids frequent changes in the search space when continuously offloading heterogeneous DNN inference tasks, thereby improving search efficiency. Experiments with six popular models show that AutoCut significantly improves inference performance regarding latency and energy efficiency.}

However, with the rapid increase in cross-cluster traffic and its inherent dynamism, existing solutions fail to meet tenants' demands for throughput and reliability, thereby leading to network performance bottlenecks in cross-cluster communication. To address this issue, we present HiReC, a system designed to achieve high-throughput and reliable cross-cluster VPC communication. To improve throughput, HiReC leverages multiple gateways with a rounding-based mapping algorithm for load balancing to forward cross-cluster traffic. Moreover, we further enhance the forwarding capabilities of gateways with the eXpress Data Path (XDP) technology. To enhance reliability, HiReC employs a low-overhead, eBPF-based monitoring module and adaptive load adjustment mechanism to dynamically adjust traffic distribution among gateways, effectively handling gateway node or link failures. We implement our system and evaluate its performance through testbed experiments. The results show that HiReC can effectively improve the throughput of cross-cluster communication and deal with abnormal events. For example, HiReC improves the throughput by  3.88 × 3.88 \\times  and reduces the failure recovery latency by  19 × 19 \\times  compared with state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of new applications in data centers intensifies the occurrence of bursty traffic. However, we investigate that, due to sluggish end-to-end reaction and slow rate convergence, existing widely used reactive protocols have several limitations in handling bursty traffic. Specifically, excessive packets are transmitted before senders activate the reaction and converge to the fair rate, which builds up a deep queue and may incur subsequent significant overreaction. In this paper, we propose Achilles, a solution concentrating on avoiding the aforementioned performance degradation as an enhanced scheme for reactive transports. Achilles consists of two components:  ( i ) (i)  a novel identification mechanism to detect the critical flows that cause congestion without impacting innocent flows; (ii) a switch-driven adjustment mechanism to promptly alleviate transient congestion while leveraging end-to-end reactive transports at the stable stage. We theoretically analyze the stability of Achilles and the oscillation boundary of queue length. Besides, we further implement Achilles with both DPDK and P4based Tofino switch. The testbed experiments and extensive large-scale simulations show that Achilles can reduce the queue length by up to about 80 % while reducing the 99th percentile FCT by up to 54 % compared with DCQCN, TIMELY and HPCC.}

	abstract = {Efficient sensing is critical for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as environmental monitoring and traffic management, where high quality sensing data is essential for decision-making. Traditional sensing methods, however, are often plagued by high deployment costs and incomplete data coverage, significantly limiting their practicality. Despite recent progress, these methods continue to face challenges in maintaining data accuracy, ultimately degrading the Quality of Service (QoS) for IoT applications. To address these limitations, we propose ASSTG, a novel framework that combines an Active Sampling strategy with Spatio-Temporal Graph learning to enable efficient and accurate IoT sensing. At its core, AS-STG is designed to minimize the sampling cost while ensuring the accuracy of the data. The framework begins by analyzing historical data to determine the minimum sampling requirements for accurate inference in subsequent time slots. It then constructs a spatio-temporal graph to model the complex relationships between sensing grids, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. To supplement the spatio-temporal information and further optimize representations, we introduce two contrastive learning tasks. Leveraging the refined representation, AS-STG strategically selects informationrich regions for sampling, ensuring that even a sparse subset of samples can provide comprehensive coverage of the entire sensing area. Finally, AS-STG employs matrix completion techniques to reconstruct the complete sensing data from these sparse samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AS-STG significantly outperforms baselines in terms of inference accuracy, cost-efficiency, and scalability. By effectively reducing sampling costs without compromising QoS, AS-STG offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic IoT sensing systems.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed to execute tasks in diverse scenarios. However, most existing studies focus on task scheduling using a fixed number of UAVs, which often leads to resource waste or the inability to complete all deadline-driven tasks-a critical issue particularly in practical scenarios such as search and rescue, surveillance and mobile edge computing. Distinct from previous works, we investigate the novel problem of scheduling deadline-driven tasks with a minimum number of UAVs (termed SLIM). This optimization is non-trivial as it requires both minimizing UAV count and ensuring optimal task execution within deadline and energy constraints. To address these challenges, we develop two complementary algorithms: (1) a dynamic programming based algorithm that provides optimal solutions for small-scale scenarios, and (2) an approximation algorithm that ensures theoretical performance guarantees for efficiently handling largescale scenarios. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approximation algorithm achieves approximately 85% of the optimal dynamic programming solution's performance while reducing the average number of UAVs by 21.8%-39.9% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Congestion Control Algorithms (DRL-based CCA) have shown their great potential to adapt to various environments automatically (e.g., Orca). However, it is difficult for existing DRL-based CCAs to achieve superior QoS consistently, particularly over mobile networks with rapid network fluctuations. The fundamental problem stems from the training of a single model that encompasses a wide range of network conditions. The resulting model can be overly generalized, rendering it less accurately or optimally tailored for a specific network condition. To tackle this challenge, we develop Network-segmented Model Specialization (NMS), a framework that automatically maximizes QoS for any DRLbased CCA under different network conditions. Specifically, NMS generates a set of models offline, each trained for a specific network segment. Online, it selects the model based on the current segment. We showed that NMS not only improves the QoSs of existing DRL-based CCAs consistently, but also opens a new way for the exploration of a clean-slate approach, as opposed to following the hybrid TCP/DRL approach. Hence, we designed Galaxy, a novel clean-slate DRL-based CCA that addresses the inherent limitations in clean-slate approaches by incorporating network segments' knowledge. Extensive evaluations show NMSoptimized Galaxy further explores NMS to achieve superior QoS.}

	abstract = {Wireless networks are pivotal to modern communication, yet traditional address-centric protocols often fail to leverage the inherent advantages of wireless transmission potentials in dynamic edge environments. While Information-centric Networking (ICN) offers promising data-centric alternatives, the integration with wireless systems in resource-constrained edge settings faces critical challenges including channel instability, unreliable transmission, and fluctuating link quality. This paper introduces RENCA, a framework designed to enable seamless NDN-based wireless communication tailored for edge environments. RENCA addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, it introduces a distributed collision avoidance strategy that leverages wireless broadcast properties to select high-quality communication pairs in real time, minimizing localized interference in wireless networks. Second, it incorporates a reliable transmission mechanism using Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNAK) to ensure data integrity while aligning with content-centric principles in dynamic edge topologies. Third, it presents a dynamic Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS) adaptation that improves communication goodput in response to real-time channel fluctuations. We implement the entire RENCA protocol stack on real wireless hardware and drivers, and conduct extensive experiments over real wireless scenarios. The system achieves a 92.96% overall goodput improvement in multi-device edge environments compared to traditional protocols, demonstrating the usefulness of robust, high-performance communication for edge applications.}

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative advancement in artificial intelligence (AI). To fully leverage their potential, Docker containers, serving as a lightweight, portable, and isolated framework, facilitate the seamless deployment of LLM-based applications. However, the deployment of containerized AI microservices faces challenges such as heavy network loads, delayed image loading, and redundancy. In this paper, we introduce MetaPipe, an innovative incremental deployment approach for containerized AI microservices in edge cloud environments. MetaPipe aims to optimize startup times through a dynamic workflow that incorporates proactive layer pre-fetching and reinforcement layer re-scheduling. The proactive pre-fetching reduces service deployment time through layer caching prediction and pre-scheduling before requests arrive, while the reinforcement re-scheduling addresses inaccuracies by dynamically adjusting layer scheduling strategies after requests arrive. Extensive experiments on realworld datasets show that MetaPipe significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving 83.58% reduction in initialization startup time and 85.58% reduction in cold startup time. These results highlight its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of AI microservices deployment within edge cloud environments.}

	abstract = {Centralized training for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) typically relies heavily on vast amounts of aggregated data, compromising user privacy. Federated learning (FL) for HAR offers a solution to protect local data privacy. However, existing FL methodologies often fail to fully capture the heterogeneity of user data and the latent correlations among user models, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited robustness. This paper proposes a Correlation-Aware Multi-Similarty Learning Method for Federated HAR, namely MultiSim. Our approach enhances model accuracy with an effective inter-user knowledge learning while protecting data privacy. MultiSim first constructs multiple similarity metrics, and then makes model feature fusion cunningly by the above metrics to learn inherent user similarity profiles. Additionally, we introduce a novel clustering-based FL framework by isolating malicious nodes, thereby mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations on two realworld HAR datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiSim over other state-of-the-art FL methods under accuracy and robustness. These findings demonstrate MultiSim's potential as a robust and effective solution for HAR.}

	abstract = {Real-time network traffic classification plays a crucial role in ensuring Quality of Service and network security, and machine learning (ML) based methods achieve high classification accuracy but induce significant computational overhead. While SmartNIC solutions can offload classification tasks thus reducing CPU burdens, they still suffer from various limitations, manifested in limited computing capabilities, insufficiency in dynamic load handling and high latency from heterogeneous computing architectures. To solve these problems, we propose SmartTC, with three key designs: (1) SmartTC employs hardware-software co-design to optimize SmartNIC processing power, (2) SmartTC adopts a trafficaware dynamic batch submission strategy that adjusts submission policies based on real-time network load, and (3) SmartTC proposes parallel pipeline scheduling that ensures efficient task execution while minimizing communication overhead. Finally, we implement SmartTC on the BlueField-3 DPU and conduct extensive experiments for evaluations, and comparison results demonstrate that SmartTC significantly outperforms existing solutions. For example, it reduces average traffic classification time by up to  1 6. 8 % \\mathbf{1 6. 8 \\%}  under low loads and  9 0. 9 % \\mathbf{9 0. 9 \\%}  under high loads. Besides, SmartTC does not affect Bluefield-3 network services, and saves host CPU usage by at least two cores.}

	abstract = {Most existing flow scheduling schemes aim to minimize the flow completion time in data center network. However, these schemes either lack fine-grained flow differentiation, sacrificing performance for deployability or require precise flow information and significant hardware modifications for nearoptimal transmission. Thus, we present Sadra, a novel flow scheduling solution leveraging multiple priority queues available in existing commodity switches to minimize FCT by assigning different initial priorities and demotion thresholds to flows with various sizes. Our intuition is that the average queuing length of small flows increases as the number of large flows grows, yet reducing queuing length improves latency of small flows with negligible impact on throughput of large flows. Sadra consists of two key parts: i) A novel scheduling scheme that utilizes imprecise predictions to assign initial priorities to flows with different sizes, enabling differentiation from the outset of transmission; ii) A size-aware demotion threshold strategy that assigns different demotion thresholds to further differentiate flows with the same initial priority, thereby reducing the blocking of small flows by large ones. We have implemented a Sadra prototype and evaluated Sadra through both testbed experiments and NS3 simulations. Simulation and testbed evaluations show that Sadra significantly reduces the average and tail FCT of small flows by up to 61% and 89% compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, respectively.}
