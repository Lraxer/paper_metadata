	abstract = {FIDO2 is the latest member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) protocol suite, which aims at providing unified password-less authentication across the web. We present a formal security analysis of the FIDO2 protocols. We extend the previously presented formalization of the security assumptions and goals of FIDO with FIDO2 specific requirements. We develop a formal model that considers both the CTAP2 and WebAuthn in FIDO2 as a whole. Our formal analysis identifies the minimal security assumptions required for each security goal of FIDO2 to hold. The verification results show FIDO2 fails to achieve some strong authentication properties. The results also reveal that the newly introduced Client PIN mechanism has flaws, and the discovered authenticator rebinding attack and parallel session attacks in UAF still exist in FIDO2.}

	abstract = {Verifiable random functions (VRF, Micali et al., FOCS’99) allow a key-pair holder to verifiably evaluate a pseudorandom function under that particular key pair. These primitives enable fair and verifiable pseudorandom lotteries, essential in proof-of-stake blockchains such as Algorand and Cardano, and are being used to secure billions of dollars of capital. As a result, there is an ongoing IRTF effort to standardize VRFs, with a proposed ECVRF based on elliptic-curve cryptography appearing as the most promising candidate. In this paper, towards understanding the general security of VRFs and in particular the ECVRF construction, we provide an ideal functionality in the Universal Composability (UC) framework (Canetti, FOCS’01) that captures VRF security, and show that ECVRF UC-realizes it. Additionally, we study batch verification in the context of VRFs. We provide a UC-functionality capturing a VRF with batch-verification capability, and propose modifications to ECVRF that allow for this feature. We again prove that our proposal UC-realizes the desired functionality. Finally, we provide a performance analysis showing that verification can yield a factor-two speedup for batches with 1024 proofs, at the cost of increasing the proof size from 80 to 128 bytes.}

	abstract = {KEMTLS is a proposal for changing the TLS handshake to authenticate the handshake using long-term key encapsulation mechanism keys instead of signatures, motivated by trade-offs in the characteristics of post-quantum algorithms. Prior proofs of security of KEMTLS and its variant KEMTLS-PDK have been hand-written proofs in the reductionist model under computational assumptions. In this paper, we present computer-verified symbolic analyses of KEMTLS and KEMTLS-PDK using two distinct Tamarin models. In the first analysis, we adapt the detailed Tamarin model of TLS\xa01.3 by Cremers et al. (ACM CCS 2017), which closely follows the wire-format of the protocol specification, to KEMTLS(-PDK). We show that KEMTLS(-PDK) has equivalent security properties to the main handshake of TLS\xa01.3 proven in this model. We were able to fully automate this Tamarin proof, compared with the previous TLS\xa01.3 Tamarin model, which required a big manual proving effort; we also uncovered some inconsistencies in the previous model. In the second analysis, we present a novel Tamarin model of KEMTLS(-PDK), which closely follows the multi-stage key exchange security model from prior pen-and-paper proofs of KEMTLS(-PDK). The second approach is further away from the wire-format of the protocol specification but captures more subtleties in security definitions, like deniability and different levels of forward secrecy; it also identifies some flaws in the security claims from the pen-and-paper proofs. Our positive security results increase the confidence in the design of KEMTLS(-PDK). Moreover, viewing these models side-by-side allows us to comment on the trade-off in symbolic analysis between detail in protocol specification and granularity of security properties.}

	abstract = {Mounting microarchitectural attacks, such as Spectre or Rowhammer, is possible from browsers. However, to be realistically exploitable, they require precise knowledge about microarchitectural properties. While a native attacker can easily query many of these properties, the sandboxed environment in browsers prevents this. In this paper, we present six side-channel-related benchmarks that reveal CPU properties, such as cache sizes or cache associativities. Our benchmarks are implemented in JavaScript and run in unmodified browsers on multiple platforms. Based on a study with 834 participants using 297 different CPU models, we show that we can infer microarchitectural properties with an accuracy of up to 100%. Combining multiple properties also allows identifying the CPU vendor with an accuracy of 97.5%, and the microarchitecture and CPU model each with an accuracy of above 60%. The benchmarks are unaffected by current side-channel and browser fingerprinting mitigations, and can thus be used for more targeted attacks and to increase the entropy in browser fingerprinting.}

	abstract = {Unwanted automation of network services by web robots (bots) increases the operation costs, and affects the satisfaction of human users, e.g., in online games or social media. Bots impact the revenue of service providers and can damage society by spreading false information. While few bots are usually not a problem, a large number is. Thus, we focus on bots that directly use a service’s application protocol, as they are the most efficient and easiest to scale. Current solutions such as registration with personal data or CAPTCHAs are frustrating for users or can be easily evaded. Anti-reverse engineering and solutions for digital rights management that impede bot creation, e.g., unique client specific API keys, are only effective for the first bot. In this paper, we introduce a novel obfuscation approach that we call polymorphic protocols and that is inspired by polymorphic malware and methods to bypass censorship resistance. When using polymorphic protocols, each client of a service has an own application protocol, so that the costs of duplicating bots for an attacker significantly increases. For every bot that an attacker wants to create, he has to extract and reimplement a protocol from a valid client. We integrate our approach into an existing ecosystem and implement it exemplarily for Protobuf and Java. Our results indicate that the overhead for service providers and users is low, depending on the deployment and chosen protocol configuration. At the same time, our polymorphic protocols significantly increase the attacker costs to create multiple bots, when limited to conventional reverse engineering techniques only.}

	abstract = {The W3C’s WebAuthn standard employs digital signatures to offer phishing protection and unlinkability on the web using authenticators which manage keys on behalf of users. This introduces challenges when the account owner wants to delegate certain rights to a proxy user, such as to access their accounts or perform actions on their behalf, as delegation must not undermine the decentralisation, unlinkability, and attestation properties provided by WebAuthn. We present two approaches, called remote and direct delegation of WebAuthn credentials, maintaining the standard’s properties. Both approaches are compatible with Yubico’s recent Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) primitive proposed for backing up credentials. For remote delegation, the account owner stores delegation credentials at the relying party on behalf of proxies, whereas the direct variant uses a delegation-by-warrant approach, through which the proxy receives delegation credentials from the account owner and presents them later to the relying party. To realise direct delegation we introduce Proxy Signature with Unlinkable Warrants (PSUW), a new proxy signature scheme that extends WebAuthn’s unlinkability property to proxy users and can be constructed generically from ARKG. We provide an instantiation of the primitive and analyse its performance, observing only a minor increase of a few milliseconds in the signing and verification times for delegated WebAuthn credentials based on the ARKG and PSUW primitives.}

	abstract = {DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is one of the standards to protect the security and privacy of users. The choice of DoH provider has controversial consequences, from monopolisation of surveillance to lost visibility by network administrators and security providers. More importantly, it is a novel security business. Software products and organisations depend on users choosing well-known and trusted DoH resolvers. However, there is no comprehensive study on the number of DoH resolvers on the Internet, its growth, and the trustworthiness of the organisations behind them. This paper studies the deployment of DoH resolvers by (i) scanning the whole Internet for DoH resolvers in 2021 and 2022; (ii) creating lists of well-known DoH resolvers by the community; (iii) characterising what those resolvers are, (iv) comparing the growth and differences. Results show that (i) the number of DoH resolvers increased 4.8 times in the period 2021–2022, (ii) the number of organisations providing DoH services has doubled, and (iii) the number of DoH resolvers in 2022 is 28 times larger than the number of well-known DoH resolvers by the community. Moreover, 94% of the public DoH resolvers on the Internet are unknown to the community, 77% use certificates from free services, and 57% belong to unknown organisations or personal servers. We conclude that the number of DoH resolvers is growing at a fast rate; also that at least 30% of them are not completely trustworthy and users should be very careful when choosing a DoH resolver.}

	abstract = {Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are integral to the Web and have existed for nearly three decades. Yet URL parsing differs subtly among parser implementations, leading to ambiguity that can be abused by attackers. We measure agreement between widely-used URL parsers and find that each has made design decisions that deviate from parsing standards, creating a fractured implementation space where assumptions of uniform interpretation are unreliable. In some cases, deviations are severe enough that clients using different parsers will make requests to different hosts based on a single, “equivocal” URL. We systematize the thousands of differences we observed into seven pitfalls in URL parsing that application developers should beware of. We demonstrate that this ambiguity can be weaponized through misdirection attacks that evade the Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal URL classifiers. URL parsing libraries have made a tradeoff to favor permissiveness over strict standards adherence. We hope this work will motivate the systemic adoption of a more unified URL parsing standard–enabling a more secure Web.}

	abstract = {Emoji domains, such as \n\n (xn–i-7iq.ws), are distinctive and attractive to registrants due to their eye-catching visuals. Despite its long history (over 20 years), little has been done to understand its development status and security issues. In this paper, we identify 54,403 emoji domains from 1,366 TLD zone files and a large-scale passive DNS dataset. And then, we correlate them with auxiliary data sources like domain WHOIS records. It allowed us to conduct by far the most systematic study to characterize the ecosystem, and retrieve multiple valuable insights. On one hand, the scale of emoji domains is constantly expanding in the wild, with dozens of ccTLD registries actively promoting registering domains with emoji characters and domain owners configuring emoji characters in sub-level domains. And emoji domains may act as promotional portals, as web requests are usually redirected to other websites. Besides, emoji domains are also leveraged to provide disposable email services, pornography or gambling pages, and even the distribution of malware. On the other hand, the concern is that the community still lacks best security practices in supporting and parsing emoji domains. Through empirical studies, we demonstrate that inconsistencies in rendering emoji characters can be exploited to launch visual phishing domain scams. Meanwhile, mainstream implementations may incorrectly parse or trans-code emoji domains, resulting in the security threat of traffic hijacking. Our study calls for standardization and best security practices for applications to handle emoji domains securely.}

	abstract = {CPU port contention has been used in the last years as a stateless side channel to perform side-channel attacks and transient execution attacks. One drawback of this channel is that it heavily relies on simultaneous multi-threading, which can be absent from some CPUs or simply disabled by the OS. In this paper, we present sequential port contention, which does not require SMT. It exploits sub-optimal scheduling to execution ports for instruction-level parallelization. As a result, specifically-crafted instruction sequences on a single thread suffer from an increased latency. We show that sequential port contention can be exploited from web browsers in WebAssembly. We present an automated framework to search for instruction sequences leading to sequential port contention for specific CPU generations, which we evaluated on 50 different CPUs. An attacker can use these sequences from the browser to determine the CPU generation within 12 s with a 95% accuracy. This fingerprint is highly stable and resistant to system noise, and we show that mitigations are either expensive or only probabilistic.}

	abstract = {A trusted computing base (TCB) is the minimum set of hardware and software components which are inherently trusted by a platform, and upon which more complex secure services can be built. The TCB is secure by definition, and it is typically implemented through hardened hardware components, which ensure that their secret data cannot be compromised. In this paper, we propose and investigate a two-tier TCB architecture that benefits both from a small hardened ‘minimal’ TCB, but also offers the possibility of integrating complex security services into an ‘extended’ TCB. Our design includes a collection of protocols to ensure (1) secure update of the components, (2) secure boot of the platform, (3) attestation, and (4) detection of powerful attackers that can corrupt memory regions together with a (highly probable) platform recovery mechanism after such an attack. The protocols have been formally modelled, and we provide a collection of security properties that have been verified using the automatic protocol verifier ProVerif.}

	abstract = {In this work, we introduce two new types of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) based on memristor arrays. Both PUFs use the output behavior of memristor cells when an excitation signal is applied to their input. First, the cells are identified by decomposing the signal response into different frequencies using the discrete Fourier transformation and evaluating the absolute sum of errors. This approach provides a maximum accuracy of 96% and F1-score of 73%. In order to improve performance, a convolutional neural network is employed to learn the shapes of the output hysteresis loop. To this end, a conversion algorithm that transforms the outputs to matrices is used. The proposed neural network achieves a maximum accuracy of 97% and F1-score of 97%, allowing for the successful utilisation of the examined PUF in practical security applications. As a use case for the proposed PUFs, we introduce a novel neural network-based authentication protocol that can be used to authenticate smart devices to a central IoT hub, e.g., in a smart home.\n}

	abstract = {The paper proposes SecureBiNN, a novel three-party secure computation framework for evaluating privacy-preserving binarized neural network (BiNN) in semi-honest adversary setting. In SecureBiNN, three participants hold input data and model parameters in secret sharing form, and execute secure computations to obtain secret shares of prediction result without disclosing their input data, model parameters and the prediction result. SecureBiNN performs linear operations in a computation-efficient and communication-free way. For non-linear operations, we provide novel secure methods for evaluating activation function, maxpooling layers, and batch normalization layers in BiNN. Communication overhead is significantly minimized comparing to previous work like XONN and Falcon. We implement SecureBiNN with tensorflow and the experiments show that using the Fitnet structure, SecureBiNN achieves on CIFAR-10 dataset an accuracy of 81.5%, with communication cost of 16.609MB and runtime of 0.527s/3.447s in the LAN/WAN settings. More evaluations on real-world datasets are also performed and other concrete comparisons with state-of-the-art are presented as well.}

	abstract = {Protocols for secure multi-party computation are commonly composed of different sub-protocols, combining techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secret or Boolean sharing, and garbled circuits. In this paper, we design a new class of multi-party computation protocols which themselves are composed out of two-party protocols. We integrate both types of compositions, compositions of fully homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits with compositions of multi-party protocols from two-party protocols. As a result, we can construct communication-efficient protocols for special problems. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently ensure the security of composed protocols against malicious adversaries by proving in zero-knowledge that conversions between individual techniques are correct. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we give an example scheme for private set analytics, i.e., private set disjointness. This scheme enjoys lower communication complexity than a solution based on generic multi-party computation and lower computation cost than fully homomorphic encryption. So, our design is more suitable for deployments in wide-area networks, such as the Internet, with many participants or problems with circuits of moderate or high multiplicative depth.\n}

	abstract = {Due to the significant drop in prices for genome sequencing in the last decade, genome databases were constantly growing. This enabled genome analyses such as Genome-Wide Association Studies\xa0(GWAS) that study associations between a gene and a disease and allow to improve medical treatment. However, GWAS fails at the analysis of complex diseases caused by non-linear gene-gene interactions such as sporadic breast cancer or type 2 diabetes. Epistasis Analysis\xa0(EA) is a more powerful approach that complements GWAS and considers non-linear interactions between multiple parts of the genome and environment. Statistical genome analyses require large, well-curated genomic datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Hence, the aggregation of multiple databases is often necessary, but the sharing of genomic data raises severe privacy concerns and is subject to extensive regulations (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA), requiring further privacy protection for collaborative analyses. Although there has been work on private GWAS, there was a lack of attention to Private\xa0EA\xa0(PEA). In this work, we design the first secure and accurate PEA protocol, with security against passive adversaries. Our efficient PEA protocol consists of two subprotocols: (1) (optional) feature selection for filtering noisy features to reduce the input size for better efficiency and (2) finding relevant associations. For feature selection, we design two protocols based on Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for Relief-F and TuRF. For finding associations, we design an MPC protocol for Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR). Our private MDR protocol is based on two novel, efficient building blocks, arithmetic greater than and arithmetic swap, which may be of independent interest. This approach omits the need for expensive conversions between sharing types in private MDR and reduces the communication by two orders of magnitude compared to a naïve design using garbled circuits. Our private MDR protocol runs in (extrapolated) three days on a practical database with 10,000 features for all two mutually combined features, i.e., considering about 50 million combinations.}

	abstract = {With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a wide spectrum of attacks against deep learning (DL) models have been proposed in the literature. Both the evasion attacks and the poisoning attacks attempt to utilize adversarially altered samples to fool the victim model to misclassify the adversarial sample. While such attacks claim to be or are expected to be stealthy, i.e., imperceptible to human eyes, such claims are rarely evaluated. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on the stealthiness of adversarial samples used in the attacks against deep learning. We have implemented 20 representative adversarial ML attacks on six popular benchmarking datasets. We evaluate the stealthiness of the attack samples using two complementary approaches: (1) a numerical study that adopts 24 metrics for image similarity or quality assessment; and (2) a user study of 3 sets of questionnaires that has collected 30,000+ annotations from 1,500+ responses. Our results show that the majority of the existing attacks introduce non-negligible perturbations that are not stealthy to human eyes. We further analyze the factors that contribute to attack stealthiness. We examine the correlation between the numerical analysis and the user studies, and demonstrate that some image quality metrics may provide useful guidance in attack designs, while there is still a significant gap between assessed image quality and visual stealthiness of attacks.}

	abstract = {With growing popularity, deep learning (DL) models are becoming larger-scale, and only the companies with vast training datasets and immense computing power can manage their business serving such large models. Most of those DL models are proprietary to the companies who thus strive to keep their private models safe from the model extraction attack (MEA), whose aim is to steal the model by training surrogate models. Nowadays, companies are inclined to offload the models from central servers to edge/endpoint devices. As revealed in the latest studies, adversaries exploit this opportunity as new attack vectors to launch side-channel attack (SCA) on the device running victim model and obtain various pieces of the model information, such as the model architecture (MA) and image dimension (ID). Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of such a relationship for the first time and would benefit future MEA studies in both offensive and defensive sides in that they may learn which pieces of information exposed by SCA are more important than the others. Our analysis additionally reveals that by grasping the victim model information from SCA, MEA can get highly effective and successful even without any prior knowledge of the model. Finally, to evince the practicality of our analysis results, we empirically apply SCA, and subsequently, carry out MEA under realistic threat assumptions. The results show up to 5.8 times better performance than when the adversary has no model information about the victim model.}

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversaries can mislead the policies of DRL agents by perturbing the state of the environment observed by the agents. Existing attacks are feasible in principle, but face challenges in practice, either by being too slow to fool DRL policies in real time or by modifying past observations stored in the agent’s memory. We show that Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP), independent of the individual inputs to which they are applied, can fool DRL policies effectively and in real time. We introduce three attack variants leveraging UAP. Via an extensive evaluation using three Atari 2600 games, we show that our attacks are effective, as they fully degrade the performance of three different DRL agents (up to 100%, even when the \\(l_\\infty \\) bound on the perturbation is as small as 0.01). It is faster than the frame rate (60\xa0Hz) of image capture and considerably faster than prior attacks (\\(\\approx \\)1.8 ms). Our attack technique is also efficient, incurring an online computational cost of \\(\\approx \\)0.027 ms. Using two tasks involving robotic movement, we confirm that our results generalize to complex DRL tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of known defenses diminishes against universal perturbations. We introduce an effective technique that detects all known adversarial perturbations against DRL policies, including all universal perturbations presented in this paper.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks that hurt the joint training global model by sending malicious updates. Existing defenses rely heavily on restrictions on clients’ model updates to defend against attacks. However, the global model can be attacked by elaborate malicious perturbation under defensive restriction due to the sensitivity of the model to perturbations, which leads the model to be vulnerable. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the defense against attacks from a novel perspective of the model stability towards perturbation on parameters. We propose a new method named Federated Learning with Model Jacobian Regularization (FLMJR) to enhance the robustness of FL. Considering prediction volatility of the model is determined by the model-output Jacobian, we reduce the Jacobian regularization to improve model stability towards model perturbations while maintaining the model’s accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments under both IID and NonIID settings to evaluate the defense against state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks, which demonstrates that our method not only has superior fidelity and robustness, but can also be easily integrated to further improve the robustness of existing server-based robust aggregation approaches (e.g., Fedavg, Trimean, Median, Bulyan, and FLTrust).}

	abstract = {The training and development of good deep learning models is often a challenging task, thus leading individuals (developers, researchers, and practitioners alike) to use third-party models residing in public repositories, fine-tuning these models to their needs usually with little-to-no effort. Despite its undeniable benefits, this practice can lead to new attack vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of one such attack, namely malware embedding in deep learning models. We push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art by introducing MaleficNet, a technique that combines spread-spectrum channel coding with error correction techniques, injecting malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks, all while causing no degradation to the model’s performance and successfully bypassing state-of-the-art detection and removal mechanisms. We believe this work will raise awareness against these new, dangerous, camouflaged threats, assist the research community and practitioners in evaluating the capabilities of modern machine learning architectures, and pave the way to research targeting the detection and mitigation of such threats.}

	abstract = {Federated learning offers a framework of training a machine learning model in a distributed fashion while preserving privacy of the participants. As the server cannot govern the clients’ actions, nefarious clients may attack the global model by sending malicious local gradients. In the meantime, there could also be unreliable clients who are benign but each has a portion of low-quality training data (e.g., blur or low-resolution images), thus may appearing similar as malicious clients. Therefore, a defense mechanism will need to perform a three-fold differentiation which is much more challenging than the conventional (two-fold) case. This paper introduces MUD-HoG, a novel defense algorithm that addresses this challenge in federated learning using long-short history of gradients, and treats the detected malicious and unreliable clients differently. Not only this, but we can also distinguish between targeted and untargeted attacks among malicious clients, unlike most prior works which only consider one type of the attacks. Specifically, we take into account sign-flipping, additive-noise, label-flipping, and multi-label-flipping attacks, under a non-IID setting. We evaluate MUD-HoG with six state-of-the-art methods on two datasets. The results show that MUD-HoG outperforms all of them in terms of accuracy as well as precision and recall, in the presence of a mixture of multiple (four) types of attackers as well as unreliable clients. Moreover, unlike most prior works which can only tolerate a low population of harmful users, MUD-HoG can work with and successfully detect a wide range of malicious and unreliable clients - up to \\(47.5\\%\\) and \\(10\\%\\), respectively, of the total population.

	abstract = {By virtualizing proprietary physical devices, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) enables agile and cost-effective deployment of network services on top of a cloud infrastructure. However, the added complexity also increases the chance of incorrect or inconsistent configurations that could leave the services or infrastructure vulnerable to security threats. Therefore, the timely identification of such misconfigurations is important to ensure the security compliance of NFV. In this regard, a typical solution is to leverage formal method-based security verification as they can provide either a rigorous mathematical proof that all configurations satisfy the required security properties, or the counterexamples (i.e., misconfigurations causing the properties to be breached). To that end, a major challenge is that the sheer scale of large NFV environments can render formal security verification so costly that the significant delays before misconfigurations can be identified may leave a large attack window. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, MLFM, that combines the efficiency of Machine Learning (ML) and the rigor of Formal Methods (FM) for fast and provable identification of misconfigurations violating a security property in NFV. Our key idea lies in an iterative teacher-learner interaction in which the teacher (FM) can gradually (over many iterations) provide more representative training data (verification results), while the learner (ML) can leverage such data to gradually obtain more accurate ML models. As a result, a small portion of the configuration data will be enough to obtain a relatively accurate ML model. The model is then applied to the remaining data to prioritize the verification of what is more likely to cause violations. We experimentally evaluate our solution and compare it to an existing security verification tool to demonstrate its benefits.}

	abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICS) provide critical functions to society and are enticing attack targets. Machine learning (ML) models—in particular, reconstruction-based ML models—are commonly used to identify attacks during ICS operation. However, the variety of ML model architectures, datasets, metrics, and techniques used in prior work makes broad comparisons and identifying optimal solutions difficult. To assist ICS security practitioners in choosing and configuring the most effective reconstruction-based anomaly detector for their ICS environment, this paper: (1) comprehensively evaluates previously proposed reconstruction-based ICS anomaly-detection approaches, and (2) shows that commonly used metrics for evaluating ML algorithms, like the point-F1 score, are inadequate for evaluating anomaly detection systems for practical use. Among our findings is that the performance of anomaly-detection systems is not closely tied to the choice of ML model architecture or hyperparameters, and that the models proposed in prior work are often larger than necessary. We also show that evaluating ICS anomaly detection over temporal ranges, e.g., with the range-F1 metric, better describes ICS anomaly-detection performance than the commonly used point-F1 metric. These so-called range-based metrics measure objectives more specific to ICS environments, such as reducing false alarms or reducing detection latency. We further show that using range-based metrics to evaluate candidate anomaly detectors leads to different conclusions about what anomaly-detection strategies are optimal.}

	abstract = {Public-key cryptography, including conventional cryptosystems and post-quantum cryptography, involves computation-intensive workloads. With noticing the extraordinary computing power of AI accelerators, in this paper, we further explore the feasibility to introduce AI accelerators into high-performance cryptographic computing. Since AI accelerators are dedicated to machine learning or neural networks, the biggest challenge is how to transform cryptographic workloads into their operations, while ensuring the correctness of the results and bringing convincing performance gains. After investigating and analysing the workload of NVIDIA AI accelerator, Tensor Core, we choose to utilize it to accelerate the polynomial multiplication, usually the most time-consuming part in lattice-based cryptography. We take measures to accommodate the matrix-multiply-and-add mode of Tensor Core and make a trade-off between precision and performance, to leverage it as a high-performance NTT box performing NTT/INTT through CUDA C++ WMMA APIs. Meanwhile, we take CRYSTALS-Kyber, the candidate to be standardized by NIST, as a case study on RTX 3080 with the Ampere Tensor Core. The empirical results show that the customized NTT of polynomial vector (\\(n=256,k=4\\)) with our NTT box obtains a speedup around 6.47x that of the state-of-the-art implementation on the same GPU platform. Compared with the AVX2 implementation submitted to NIST, our Kyber-1024 can achieve a speedup of 26x, 36x, and 35x for each phase.}

	abstract = {The maritime domain is among the critical sectors of our way of life. It is undergoing a major digital transformation introducing changes to its operations and technology. The International Maritime Organization urged the maritime community to introduce cyber risk management into their systems. This includes the continuous identification and analysis of the threat landscape. This paper investigates a novel threat against the maritime infrastructure that utilizes a prominent maritime system that is the Automatic Identification System (AIS) for establishing covert channels. We provide empirical evidence regarding its feasibility and applicability to existing and future maritime systems as well as discuss mitigation measures against it. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of the covert channels by introducing two realistic cyber attacks against an Autonomous Passenger Ship (APS) emulated in a testing environment. Our findings confirm that AIS can be utilized for establishing covert channels for communicating Command & Control (C &C) messages and transferring small files for updating the cyber arsenal without internet access. Also, the establishment and utilization of the covert channels have been found to be possible using existing attack vectors and technologies related to a wide range of maritime systems. We hope that our findings further motivate the maritime community to increase their efforts for integrating cyber security practices into their systems.}

	abstract = {The sharing of energy usage data in smart grids is becoming increasingly popular because it not only allows different entities to access fine-grained energy consumption data but also improves the effectiveness of smart grid technologies. How to ensure both verifiability and privacy of the shared data is a vital issue. Most existing privacy-preserving authentication schemes greatly hinder the flexibility of sharing data among multiple parties due to vulnerability and inefficiency reasons. The customer-centric energy usage data management framework based on redactable signature (RS) technology can be seen as an effective solution. It offers customers the flexibility to remove parts of privacy-sensitive data depending on different data usage demands, and ensures data verifiability for third party service providers. However, existing RS schemes are computationally inefficient for constrained devices such as smart meters. Besides, it is said that quantum computers are expected to break all traditional public-key primitives. In this regard, almost all existing RS schemes are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address the above concerns, in this work, we propose a hash-based RS scheme HRSS based on a variant of the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali tree, a length-doubling pseudorandom generator, and an underlying SPHINCS\\(^+\\) framework. Our HRSS is the first quantum-safe RS scheme, where the security depends only on the security of underlying hash functions. We instantiate and evaluate the performance of our design. Theoretical and experimental comparisons with recent works show that HRSS is practical for smart grids.}

	abstract = {Cyberattacks against industrial control systems pose a serious risk to the safety of humans and the environment. Industrial intrusion detection systems oppose this threat by continuously monitoring industrial processes and alerting any deviations from learned normal behavior. To this end, various streams of research rely on advanced and complex approaches, i.e., artificial neural networks, thus achieving allegedly high detection rates. However, as we show in an analysis of 70 approaches from related work, their inherent complexity comes with undesired properties. For example, they exhibit incomprehensible alarms and models only specialized personnel can understand, thus limiting their broad applicability in a heterogeneous industrial domain. Consequentially, we ask whether industrial intrusion detection indeed has to be complex or can be SIMPLE instead, i.e., Sufficient to detect most attacks, Independent of hyperparameters to dial-in, Meaningful in model and alerts, Portable to other industrial domains, Local to a part of the physical process, and computationally Efficient. To answer this question, we propose our design of four SIMPLE industrial intrusion detection systems, such as simple tests for the minima and maxima of process values or the rate at which process values change. Our evaluation of these SIMPLE approaches on four state-of-the-art industrial security datasets reveals that SIMPLE approaches can perform on par with existing complex approaches from related work while simultaneously being comprehensible and easily portable to other scenarios. Thus, it is indeed justified to raise the question of whether industrial intrusion detection needs to be inherently complex.}

	abstract = {Voice messages are an increasingly popular method of communication, accounting for more than 200 million messages a day. Sending audio messages requires a user to invest lesser effort than texting while enhancing the message’s meaning by adding an emotional context (e.g., irony). Unfortunately, we suspect that voice messages might provide much more information than intended to prying ears of a listener. In fact, speech audio waves are both directly recorded by the microphone and propagated into the environment, and possibly reflected back to the microphone. Reflected waves along with ambient noise are also recorded by the microphone and sent as part of the voice message. In this paper, we propose a novel attack for inferring detailed information about user location (e.g., a specific room) leveraging a simple WhatsApp voice message. We demonstrated our attack considering 7,200 voice messages from 15 different users and four environments (i.e., three bedrooms and a terrace). We considered three realistic attack scenarios depending on previous knowledge of the attacker about the victim and the environment. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed attack. We can infer the location of the user among a pool of four known environments with 85% accuracy. Moreover, our approach reaches an average accuracy of 93% in discerning between two rooms of similar size and furniture (i.e., two bedrooms) and an accuracy of up to 99% in classifying indoor and outdoor environments.}

	abstract = {System auditing is a powerful tool that provides insight into the nature of suspicious events in computing systems, allowing machine operators to detect and subsequently investigate security incidents. While auditing has proven invaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks are rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The transparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a variety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however, if audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be rendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the RTS. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS. Using Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of audit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the temporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address this, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that leverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively reduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct descriptions of RT applications’ expected activity while retaining a detailed record of unexpected activities, enabling analysis of suspicious activity while meeting temporal constraints. Our evaluation of Ellipsis, using ArduPilot (an open-source autopilot application suite) demonstrates up to 93% reduction in audit log generation.}

	abstract = {TLS is a well-known and thoroughly studied security protocol. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of vulnerabilities affecting TLS implementations, state machine errors. These vulnerabilities are caused by differences in interpreting the standard and correspond to deviations from the specifications, e.g.\xa0accepting invalid messages, or accepting valid messages out of sequence. We develop a systematic methodology to infer the state machines of major TLS stacks from stimuli and observations, and to study their evolution across revisions. We use the L\\({}^{\\star }\\) algorithm to compute state machines corresponding to different execution scenarios. We reproduce several known vulnerabilities (denial of service, authentication bypasses), and uncover new ones. We also show that state machine inference is efficient and practical for integration within a continuous integration pipeline, to help find new vulnerabilities or deviations introduced during development. With our systematic black-box approach, we study over 400 different versions of server and client implementations in various scenarios (protocol version, options). Using the resulting state machines, we propose a robust algorithm to fingerprint TLS stacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of this approach on such a broad perimeter, in terms of number of TLS stacks, revisions, or execution scenarios studied.}

	abstract = {Inspired by Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, i.e., an institutional building design in which a single security guard is able to monitor all detainees while they are unable to tell if they are being watched, we design the PanoptiCANs—a series of adversary-resilient CAN bus architectures. While DoS attacks are impossible to prevent on a regular bus topology, the PanoptiCANs are able to actively respond to them, as well as to generic attacks, by air gapping the network. The proposed modifications allow a bus guardian to monitor and isolate intruders on the bus while all traffic is redirected so that legitimate nodes carry on their tasks without significant disturbances. A decentralized version delegates these abilities to regular nodes, reducing costs and wire lengths, while also being able to localize and isolate the intruders much faster. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed topologies on an experimental setup with automotive grade controllers and collected in-vehicle traffic data. With the most effective architecture, intruders are isolated in a few milliseconds following single frame injections.}

	abstract = {Rust is a promising system-level programming language that can prevent memory corruption bugs using its strong type system and ownership-based memory management scheme. In practice, programmers usually write Rust code in conjunction with other languages such as C/C++ through Foreign Function Interface (FFI). For example, many notable projects are developed using Rust and other programming languages, such as Firefox, Google Fuchsia OS, and the Linux kernel. Although it is widely believed that gradually re-implementing security-critical components in Rust is a way of enhancing software security, however, using FFI is inherently unsafe. In this paper, we show that memory management across the FFI boundaries is error-prone. Any incorrect use of FFI may corrupt Rust’s ownership system, leading to memory safety issues. To tackle this problem, we design and build FFIChecker, an automated static analysis and bug detection tool dedicated to memory management issues across the Rust/C FFI. We evaluate our tool by checking 987 Rust packages crawled from the official package registry and reveal 34 bugs in 12 packages. Our experiments show that FFIChecker is a useful tool to detect real-world cross-language memory management issues with a reasonable amount of computational resources.}

	abstract = {Android applications ship with several native C/C++ libraries. Research on Android security has revealed that these libraries often come from third-party components that are not kept up to date by developers, possibly posing security concerns. To assess if known vulnerabilities in these libraries constitute an immediate security problem, we need to understand whether vulnerable functions could be reached when apps are executed (we refer to this problem as function reachability). In this paper, we propose DroidReach, a novel, static approach to assess the reachability of native function calls in Android apps. Our framework addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art approaches by employing a combination of heuristics and symbolic execution, allowing for a more accurate reconstruction of the Inter-procedural Control-Flow Graphs (ICFGs). On the top 500 applications from the Google Play Store, DroidReach can detect a significantly higher number of paths in comparison to previous works. Finally, two case studies show how DroidReach can be used as a valuable vulnerability assessment tool.}

	abstract = {Virtual calls in C++ are known to be vulnerable to control-flow attacks, and Virtual Call Control Flow Integrity (VCFI) is a proposed defense. However, most existing VCFI defenses are incompatible with real-world C++ software that need extensibility in the form of dynamic loading, foreign language interface, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible VCFI mechanism—namely eVCFI—that is flexible enough to handle such software requirements. eVCFI uses Approximate Membership Query (AQM) filters, recasting VCFI as an efficient set membership query, giving an O(1) time VCFI check that can be implemented in only a few instructions, all while supporting extensibility and multi-threading. We compare eVCFI with existing VCFIs, showing that we can achieve more accurate policies or extensibility compared with other VCFI mechanisms designed for efficiency or modularity. Evaluation of eVCFI shows small 1.3% overhead with SPEC 2006. Furthermore, we evaluate eVCFI against the FireFox web browser: an example of large/complex C++ software that uses both dynamic loading and a foreign language interface (Rust). We show that eVCFI can protect Firefox with a small overhead of 1.15%. We believe that eVCFI is the first VCFI defense able to protect complex software like Firefox.}

In particular, we introduce a novel web-based data collection tool utilizing gamification elements that benefits from appealing aesthetics and implemented narrative elements to engage users into prolonged play. The player’s role is to label presented passwords with available descriptive tags. Our goal is to collect a large number of gaming data to identify prevalent tag choices through consensus, and as such, assign perceived meaning to the passwords through the tags. An initial field test of the prototype returned a high number of responses that were determined to be valid when assessed via internal controls.}

	abstract = {Automatic speaker verification (ASV) system is widely used in many voice-based applications, which are very vulnerable to spoofing attacks like Text-to-Speech synthesis and converted voice signals. Effectively detecting the spoofed audio is the main solution to protect ASV systems. However, new types of spoofing technologies are emerging rapidly, and existing researches have exposed poor generalization and low robustness to unknown attacks. In this paper, an audio spoofing detection is proposed based on Constant-Q Spectral Sketches (CQSS) and parallel-attention SE-ResNet. Specially, CQSS features are first extracted using the constant-Q transform, characterized by matrix and spectrogram respectively fed into different detection model. Then, a new deep neural network architecture is proposed based on SE-ResNet, and parallel attention is designed to improve generalization ability and training efficiency. Finally, the yielding scores by different model are fused using an average strategy. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion method achieves the tandem decision cost function and equal error rate scores as 0.0307 and 0.96%, respectively, for unknown attacks, which has better verification performance compared with state-of-art methods.}

	abstract = {Mixing protocols serve as a promising solution to the unlinkability in blockchains. They work by hiding one transaction among a set of transactions and enjoy the advantage of high compatibility with the underlying system. However, due to the inherent public addresses of the blockchains built on the account-based model, the unlinkability is highly restricted to non-confidential transactions. In this paper, we propose MixCT, a mixing service for confidential payment systems built from homomorphic commitment in the account-based model. We provide an efficient instantiation of MixCT by the Pedersen commitment and the one-out-of-many proof. The evaluation results show that MixCT introduces a small cost for its users while being highly compatible with the underlying blockchain.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces the multi-freq-ldpy Python package for multiple frequency estimation under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) guarantees. LDP is a gold standard for achieving local privacy with several real-world implementations by big tech companies such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft. The primary application of LDP is frequency (or histogram) estimation, in which the aggregator estimates the number of times each value has been reported. The presented package provides an easy-to-use and fast implementation of state-of-the-art solutions and LDP protocols for frequency estimation of: single attribute (i.e., the building blocks), multiple attributes (i.e., multidimensional data), multiple collections (i.e., longitudinal data), and both multiple attributes/collections. Multi-freq-ldpy is built on the well-established Numpy package – a de facto standard for scientific computing in Python – and the Numba package for fast execution. These features are described and illustrated in this paper with two worked examples. This package is open-source and publicly available under an MIT license via GitHub (https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) and can be installed via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/multi-freq-ldpy/).}

	abstract = {Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are a popular class of models which find widespread use because of their ability to synthesise data from complex, high-dimensional manifolds. However, even with their increasing industrial adoption, they have not been subject to rigorous security analysis. In this work we examine backdoor attacks on DGMs which can significantly limit their applicability within a model supply chain and cause massive reputation damage for companies outsourcing DGMs form third parties. DGMs are vastly different from their discriminative counterparts and manifestation of attacks in DGMs is largely understudied. To this end we propose three novel training-time backdoor attacks which require modest computation effort but are highly effective. Furthermore, we demonstrate their effectiveness on large-scale industry-grade models across two different domains - images (StyleGAN) and audio (WaveGAN). Finally, we present an insightful discussion and prescribe a practical and comprehensive defense strategy for safe usage of DGMs.}
