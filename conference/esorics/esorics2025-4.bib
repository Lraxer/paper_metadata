	abstract = {Health, fitness, and medical apps have become increasingly popular to help users manage their well-being. However, their widespread use raises significant concerns about data privacy, given the sensitive nature of the information they process. In this study, we evaluate the transparency and regulatory compliance of such apps by focusing on three key aspects: actual data transmission behavior, claims made in privacy policies—particularly concerning third-country recipients—and the presence of dark patterns in their user interfaces. We combine network traffic analysis with a systematic review of privacy policies to examine whether data is transmitted before consent and whether recipients align with disclosures. In addition, we analyze interface designs for manipulative elements that can hinder informed consent. Our results reveal discrepancies between stated and observed data flows, instances of pre-consent data transmission, and recurring dark patterns. These findings highlight critical transparency gaps and underscore the need for stronger enforcement and user-centered privacy design.}

	abstract = {Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a widely accepted framework for privacy-preserving data collection. In LDP, many protocols rely on hash functions to implement user-side encoding and perturbation. However, the security and privacy implications of hash function selection have not been previously investigated. In this paper, we expose that the hash functions may act as a source of unfairness in LDP protocols. We show that although users operate under the same protocol and privacy budget, differences in hash functions can lead to significant disparities in vulnerability to inference and poisoning attacks. To mitigate hash-induced unfairness, we propose Fair-OLH (F-OLH), a variant of OLH that enforces an entropy-based fairness constraint on hash function selection. Experiments show that F-OLH is effective in mitigating hash-induced unfairness under acceptable time overheads.}

	abstract = {The k-nearest neighbor query is widely used in various applications. Due to security and privacy concerns, it is important to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information. However, existing solutions either violate the privacy requirements (i.e., data, query, result or indirect privacy) or scale badly with the data size. We first highlight the vulnerabilities of additive homomorphic encryption-based approaches. We then conduct in-depth research on the Privacy-Preserving k-Nearest Neighbor (PPkNN) query to simultaneously address the aforementioned concerns. Using the secret sharing technique and a model of two non-colluding servers, we design a Basic PPkNN (BPPkNN) protocol for arbitrary dimensional datasets. BPPkNN obliviously rearranges the dataset in a divide-and-conquer manner, reducing interaction rounds from linear to sublinear. We further propose a Voronoi-based PPkNN (VPPkNN) protocol for geo-location datasets, which uses the Voronoi diagram for index construction and a greedy algorithm for index compression. By obliviously accessing only a small portion of the dataset, VPPkNN significantly reduces expensive operations. We prove that our protocols simultaneously preserve data, query, result, and indirect privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our protocols outperform existing approaches by at least an order of magnitude in query response time and, for the first time, scale to datasets with one million points.}

	abstract = {Network side channel often rely on privileged attacker positions, e.g., physical proximity, person-in-the-middle scenarios, or code on the victim machine. Recent fully remote attacks without a privileged position are either easily mitigated (e.g., ICMP pings) or require minimal user interaction (e.g., SnailLoad). In this paper, we reduce user interaction in fully remote network side-channel attacks in two directions: First, we analyze 21 communication tools that automatically establish connections without user interaction with external references. We identify privacy-concerning automated behavior for 4 out of 11 messengers and 6 out of 10 email clients, leaking victim IP addresses without user interaction, undermining end-to-end encryption, and even enabling remote SnailLoad attacks without user interaction. Second, we show that even without any specific client software, merely processing TCP packets can already enable zero-click attacks. We introduce a novel latency measurement method based on TCP SYN packets, exploiting that TCP SYN packets to a closed port either lead to a timeout or, in our experiments about once per second, an ICMP-based response. Timing these responses yields a coarse SnailLoad trace, sufficient to mount a video fingerprinting attack with an \\(F_1\\) score of \\(56\\%\\) compared to \\(89\\%\\) on a similar Internet connection and the same number of videos as prior work. Thus, our findings confirm in both directions that fully automated side-channel attacks without user interaction are feasible and posing a relevant privacy threat.}

	abstract = {A coinjoin protocol aims to increase transactional privacy for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like blockchains via collaborative transactions, by violating assumptions behind common analysis heuristics. Estimating the resulting privacy gain is a crucial yet unsolved problem due to a range of influencing factors and large computational complexity. We adapt the BlockSci on-chain analysis software to coinjoin transactions, demonstrating a significant (10–50%) average post-mix anonymity set size decrease for all three major designs with a central coordinator: Whirlpool, Wasabi 1.x, and Wasabi 2.x. The decrease is highest during the first day and negligible after one year from a coinjoin creation.\n Moreover, we design a precise, parallelizable privacy estimation method, which takes into account coinjoin fees, implementation-specific limitations and users’ post-mix behavior. We evaluate our method in detail on a set of emulated and real-world Wasabi 2.x coinjoins and extrapolate to its largest real-world coinjoins with hundreds of inputs and outputs. We conclude that despite the users’ undesirable post-mix behavior, correctly attributing the coins to their owners is still very difficult, even with our improved analysis algorithm.}

	abstract = {Development of HTML emails increases parsing complexity and discrepancies. Owing to parsing and rendering differences, email systems expose a new attack surface: Cloaked Spam Email (CSE). CSE exploits the legitimate functions of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to build invisible content for cloaking. It can stealthily bypass spam engines and deceive users. However, there is a lack of the understanding of this novel email cloaking threat, let alone a systematic assessment of its threat impacts, leaving a defense gap. To fill the understanding gap of CSE risk, this paper reveals its threat impacts via empirical analysis and real-world measurements. First, through systematic analysis of CSS rendering features and their applicability to email clients, we identified 16 invisible configurations. Based on these findings, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 14 well-known email services. Our results reveal 12 services vulnerable to CSE, with our constructed spam samples successfully bypassing their detection and reaching victim inboxes, including Gmail, Fastmail, and QQ. To systematically assess the impact of CSEs in the wild, we developed a detection framework and applied it to two real-world spam datasets: an open-source spam dataset and the actual logs from a renowned email service provider. Through analyzing a combined total of 8,816,785 emails, we successfully detected 102,156 CSE attacks, highlighting the presence of such threats in the email ecosystem. Finally, we responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to affected email providers and provided mitigation recommendations against CSE threat.}

	abstract = {Biometric authentication is a widely used security mechanism that leverages unique physiological or behavioral characteristics to authenticate users. In multi-factor biometrics (MFB), multiple biometric modalities, e.g., physiological and behavioral biometrics, are integrated to mitigate the limitations inherent in single-factor biometric systems. The primary research challenge within MFB lies in identifying novel behavioral techniques capable of meeting critical criteria, including high accuracy, high usability, non-invasiveness, resilience against spoofing and other known attacks, and low use of computational resources. Despite ongoing advancements, current behavioral biometric techniques often fall short of fulfilling one or more of these requirements. In this work, we propose BlowPrint, a novel behavioral biometric technique that allows us to authenticate users based on their phone blowing behaviors. In brief, we assume that the way users blow on a phone screen can produce distinctive acoustic patterns, which can serve as a unique behavioral biometric identifier for effective user identification or authentication. The acoustic features of blowing, such as differences in pattern, intensity, frequency, and timing, are unique to each person, making this technique highly accurate, non-invasive, and exceedingly robust against spoofing and other attacks. Moreover, it can be concurrently performed and seamlessly integrated with other physiological techniques, such as facial recognition, thereby enhancing usability. To assess BlowPrint’s effectiveness, we conduct an empirical study involving 50 participants from whom we collect blow-acoustic and facial feature data in both sitting and standing modes. Subsequently, we compute the similarity scores of the blow-acoustic data using various time-series similarity algorithms, while we use a pretrained FaceNet-512 model for the facial recognition features. Finally, we combine the similarity scores of the two modalities through score-level fusion and compute the accuracy using a machine learning-based classifier. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates an accuracy of 99.35% for blow acoustics, 99.96% for facial recognition, and 99.82% for the combined approach. The experimental results demonstrate BlowPrint’s high effectiveness in terms of authentication accuracy, spoofing attack resilience, usability, non-invasiveness, and other aspects.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a serious threat to the security of critical infrastructure and increase the risk of sensitive data leakage. They employ sophisticated techniques to evade detection and thus may bypass defense mechanisms. Current provenance-based methods have yielded promising results in APT detection and investigation, but they still face significant challenges. They rely heavily on prior knowledge, struggle to accurately trace the long-duration propagation of malicious events, and are deficient in attack scenario analysis. To address these challenges, we propose GET-AID, a Graph-Enhanced Transformer for provenance-based Attack Investigation and Detection, which requires no prior knowledge. First, we construct subgraphs from event sequences based on their temporal relationships to enable long-duration node-level tracking. Second, we introduce a two-stage graph encoder that leverages node-level and event-level attention mechanisms to capture the relationships across the subgraphs. Finally, GET-AID identifies anomalous events and generate attack scenarios across subgraphs by tracing associated nodes across subgraphs. Experimental results on multiple real-world APT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GET-AID, achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 100% in open-source datasets and approaching 100% in others. Furthermore, results from attack scenario reconstruction, performance overhead analysis, and continuous training validate the end-to-end usability and attack analysis capabilities of the GET-AID framework.}

	abstract = {Rug pull schemes vary structurally in their methods and in how blockchains shape their economic profiles. We measure how rug pulls operate across six blockchains: Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, and BNB Smart Chain. Each chain shows distinct execution patterns, not just in scam rate but in how capital enters and exits. Solana records the highest rug pull density (55% of all tokens flagged) and the shortest liquidity lifespans. Most pools live for less than an hour, yet 71% yield net gains for their creators. The remove-to-add liquidity ratios in Solana exceed 1.0, compared to other chains. Avalanche shows fewer scams but deeper capital engagement, averaging 227 liquidity additions per rug-pulled token. Ethereum anchors cross-chain flows but exhibits the lowest attacker profitability. Post-removal traces reveal structured use of bridges like Wormhole and Stargate. Stablecoins (USDC, USDT) dominate bridge activity, enabling fast, high-liquidity exits. Solana tokens show bridged values exceeding one quadrillion USD, signaling pricing anomalies absent in legitimate pools. We define ten observed patterns, including atomic drains, fake-volume deployments, non-interactive exits, and bridge laundering. Our analysis relies on data from thousands of tokens and pools without external labels, exposing execution-layer asymmetries shaped by liquidity management design, gas friction, and interoperability channels.}

	abstract = {In recent years, a huge amount of mobility data has been collected from multiple sources, which has shown increasing utility in various domains such as transportation optimization, disease spread prediction and location-based services. However, trajectory data, a specific type of mobility data, raises substantial privacy concerns due to its high inference potential with respect to the personal information of users. To address this issue, we propose a new privacy-preserving trajectory data publication mechanism based on representation learning and differential privacy. Our approach is based on an effective and scalable trajectory-to-vector encoder that is based on a transformer neural architecture. First, we demonstrate that directly using such an encoder does not suffice to protect the original raw data, as the encoder can still expose information that may reflect individual characteristics of the underlying data, thus raising privacy concerns similar to those associated with directly sharing this data. More precisely, we show that an adversary that has access to the encoder can exploit it to conduct a successful Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) attack. Afterwards to address this issue, we introduce an efficient privacy-preserving trajectory-to-vector encoder, combining PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensemble) framework and Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT), which provides a satisfying privacy-utility trade-off. In particular, the learned encoder can be employed as a building block for other mobility-related downstream tasks.}

	abstract = {The Internet Engineering Task Force and its LAKE working group standardized the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) authenticated key-exchange protocol for use in constrained Internet of Things deployments. The use cases include cellular networks, such as NB-IoT, but also non-cellular networks such as 6TiSCH, and LoRaWAN. As a result of its use in cellular networks, EDHOC will be subject to Lawful Interception (LI), which allows a group of authorities to break, if equipped with a warrant, the end-to-end (E2E) security of the channel established through EDHOC. Current implementations of EDHOC would only allow lawful interception by using the cellular network operator as a legitimate endpoint, essentially running a Person-in-the-Middle attack against the protocol. In this work, we focus on a privacy-preserving, fine-grained LI-compliant modification of EDHOC for all four authentication methods that this protocol currently supports. We achieve this via a careful white-box composition of EDHOC with the Lawful Interception Key-Exchange approach of Arfaoui et al.\xa0(ESORICS 2021) and Bultel and Onete (SAC 2022). Our resulting construction not only achieves strong key-security, but also non-frameability, and LI-compliance, without breaking the identity-protection property of EDHOC. Our implementation results show that, while LIKE adds an overhead to a standard EDHOC implementation in Rust, the resulting protocol remains practical while achieving much better privacy and LI-compliance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the problem of publishing multidimensional data under differential privacy (DP), particularly on how to construct privacy-preserving views using a domain decomposition approach. The core idea is to recursively split\xa0the domain into sub-domains until convergence, then perturb and publish them. The result is a tree structure that enables efficient indexing and fast approximation processing of queries, while ensuring privacy. Existing decomposition-based methods face two\xa0main challenges: (i) efficiently managing the privacy budget over\xa0an indefinite decomposition depth h, and (ii) designing\xa0a data-dependent splitting strategy that minimizes the error\xa0while limiting the subdomain size. We propose RIPOST,\xa0a multidimensional decomposition algorithm with bounded and flexible budget allocation that eliminates the need for a predefined\xa0depth h and exploits a data-aware splitting strategy with a\xa0good trade-off between privacy and utility. RIPOST follows\xa0a two-phase process: it first isolates non-empty sub-domains\xa0from empty ones, and then refines the decomposition using the\xa0mean function to minimize inaccuracies. Through extensive experiments, RIPOST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods\xa0in terms of data utility and accuracy across various datasets\xa0and scenarios.}

	abstract = {Searchable encryption (SE) enables efficient search over encrypted databases by allowing a predetermined amount of information leakage during operations. While this leakage is typically considered “inconsequential,” its real-world impact on security remains unclear and must be carefully analyzed. Leakage abuse attacks aim to exploit such leakage to recover sensitive information, such as search queries or database contents. In this paper, we revisit one of the most powerful leakage abuse attacks to date, the \\(\\textsf{Subgraph}\\) attack (NDSS 2020), and examine two critical aspects: its experimental evaluation methodology and its core algorithm. Although empirical evaluation is essential for understanding the effectiveness of these attacks, we show that prior studies often rely on unrealistic experimental assumptions. We identify and analyze this issue and present a sound and realistic evaluation framework for the \\(\\textsf{Subgraph}\\) attack. Our results show that its previously reported effectiveness was indeed overestimated. In addition, we propose two improved variants of the \\(\\textsf{Subgraph}\\) attacks, \\(\\textsf{Subgraph}\\texttt {+}^\\textsf{ID}\\) and \\(\\textsf{SimGraph}^\\textsf{VL}\\), that exploit allowable leakage commonly considered acceptable in the SE literature. Under our sound experimental setting, these improved attacks achieve up to twice the query recovery performance of the original \\(\\textsf{Subgraph}\\) attacks.}

	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols for dynamically available systems face a critical challenge: balancing latency and security in fluctuating node participation. Existing solutions often require multiple rounds of voting per decision, leading to high latency or limited resilience to adversarial behavior. This paper presents a BFT protocol integrating a pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) into message transmission. By binding users’ identities to their messages through PVSS, our approach reduces communication rounds. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our protocol typically requires only four network delays (4\\(\\Delta \\)) in common scenarios while being resilient to up to 1/2 adversarial participants. This integration enhances the efficiency and security of the protocol without compromising integrity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the robustness of the protocol against Byzantine attacks. Experimental evaluations show that, compared to traditional BFT protocols, our protocol significantly prevents fork occurrences and improves chain stability. Furthermore, compared to longest-chain protocol, our protocol maintains stability and lower latency in scenarios with moderate participation fluctuations.}

	abstract = {Language-based information flow control (IFC) enables reasoning about and enforcing security policies in decentralized applications. While information flow properties are relatively extensional and compositional, designing expressive systems that enforce such properties remains challenging. In particular, it can be difficult to use IFC labels to model certain security assumptions, such as semi-honest agents. Motivated by these modeling limitations, we study the algebraic semantics of lattice-based IFC label models, and propose a semantic framework that allows formalizing asymmetric delegation, which is partial delegation of confidentiality or integrity. Our framework supports downgrading of information and ensures their safety through nonmalleable information flow (NMIF). To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement a novel algorithm that statically checks NMIF and a label inference procedure that efficiently supports bounded label polymorphism, allowing users to write code generic with respect to labels.}

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is embraced as the crucial implementation of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), enhancing content distribution and caching efficiency through edge routers. However, existing NDN architectures face significant security and privacy challenges, including: (a) a lack of secure and efficient access control; (b) inadequate support for flexible and selective content management by content publishers; (c) insufficient implementation of accountability and privilege revocation mechanisms. To handle these challenges, we propose ESAS, the first-ever Efficient Security-enhanced Accountable Access Control Scheme for NDN. Specifically, our ESAS incorporates anonymous authentication using group signatures at network routers to prevent unauthorized access, employs key-aggregation-based access control to facilitate selective content management, and maintains an access list at edge routers to trace and revoke privileges from content subscribers who misuse authorization tokens. Furthermore, our comprehensive security analysis and comparative studies validate enhanced security capabilities and superior features of our ESAS relative to existing access control solutions. We also conduct experiments to indicate the practicability and feasibility of our ESAS for edge routers, content publishers and subscribers, thereby confirming its effectiveness in NDN architecture.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of sensitive time series data being collected, stored, and queried in cloud environments, it is imperative to integrate owner-centric privacy controls with encrypted data processing to enable secure and flexible data sharing. Existing systems, however, often lack the flexibility to express nuanced privacy policies and fail to adequately protect sensitive metadata. Adversaries can exploit declared policies, query attributes, and data access patterns to infer confidential information about data owners. In this paper, we present Dobby, a privacy-preserving time series data analytics system that enforces fine-grained and flexible access policies through function secret sharing (FSS). Dobby ensures robust privacy protection for policies, query attributes, and access patterns, while achieving malicious security in a two-party computation setting. Furthermore, we propose an optimized algorithm to streamline policy evaluation, significantly reducing communication overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of Dobby. For a query involving 100 ciphertexts, the system achieves a query latency of approximately 3.3\xa0s on 10,000 data streams, each governed by an access policy comprising eight conditions.}

	abstract = {In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information. Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance. This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models, our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture’s foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.}

	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, a cornerstone of blockchain technology, has seen significant advancements. While existing BFT protocols ensure security guarantees, they often suffer from efficiency challenges, particularly under conditions of network instability or malicious exploitation of system mechanisms. We propose a novel Shared Mempool (SMP) protocol, named Imitater, which can be seamlessly integrated into BFT protocols. By chaining microblocks and applying coding techniques, Imitater efficiently achieves totality and availability. Furthermore, a BFT protocol augmented with Imitater ensures order preservation of client transactions while mitigating the risks of over-distribution and unbalanced workload. In the experiment, we integrate Imitater into the HotStuff protocol, resulting in Imitater-HS. The performance of Imitater-HS is validated in a system with up to 256 nodes. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach: Imitater-HS achieves higher throughput and lower latency in the presence of faulty nodes compared to Stratus-HS, the state-of-the-art protocol. Notably, the throughput improvement increases with the number of faulty nodes.}

	abstract = {Nakamoto Consensus (NC), the foundational mechanism\xa0of Bitcoin, secures permissionless blockchains through Proof-of-Work (PoW) and the longest-chain rule. Although classical analyses suggest exponentially low success probabilities for attackers with less than 50% hash power, real-world double-spending attacks (DSAs) persist, especially when pre-mining is involved. However, existing models either neglect pre-mining or inadequately capture its trade-offs with post-transaction mining. In this paper, we first develop a pre-mining DSA model with fixed cost constraints, deriving closed-form expressions for success probability and expected revenue. Next, we propose an Adaptive Pre-mining DSA strategy that dynamically optimizes attack timing for profit maximization using Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP). Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of our attack strategies, demonstrating their superior performance over existing models. Based on transaction values, we propose optimal confirmation block thresholds. These insights contribute to both theoretical and practical security improvements for decentralized system protocols.}
