	abstract = {Anonymous Internet use is essential to safeguard against mass surveillance and to protect privacy online. Tor Browser and the Tor anonymity network provide an effective and convenient way to browse the Internet anonymously. However, many websites make browsing inconvenient for anonymous users either by blocking access entirely, by blocking access to some functionality, or by using CAPTCHAs to make access more difficult. Prior work has relied on heuristics to study the extent to which anonymous users are treated differently. However, these heuristics either underestimated blocking or required extensive manual labeling. To address these shortcomings, here we propose a machine learning approach to detect when anonymous users are treated differently. We train binary and multi-class classifiers based on six feature sets and find that they perform very well on our test data (F1 scores 100%–94% for binary and 97%–84% for multi-class classifiers). Applying these classifiers to data collected from browsing 1,000 sites, including visits to subsites and executing search functionality, via 100 Tor exit nodes we find that 16.7% of landing pages inconvenience anonymous users, compared with 15.2% of subsites and 3.8% of search result pages. In particular, we find that websites hosted by Akamai, EdgeCast, and Cloudflare have significantly higher block rates than average, and that blocking of search results is dominated by Google which displays a block page or CAPTCHA for 39.8% of search result pages.}

	abstract = {The use of biometrics such as fingerprints, voices, and images are becoming increasingly more ubiquitous through people’s daily lives, in applications ranging from authentication, identification, to much more sophisticated analytics, thanks to the recent rapid advances in both the sensing hardware technologies and machine learning techniques. While providing improved user experiences and better business insights, the use of biometrics has raised serious privacy concerns, due to their intrinsic sensitive nature and the accompanying high risk of leaking personally identifiable and private information. In this paper, we propose a novel utility-preserving biometric anonymization framework, which provides a method to anonymize a biometric dataset without introducing artificial or external noise, with a process that retains features relevant for downstream machine learning-based analyses to extract interesting attributes that are valuable to relevant services, businesses, and research organizations. We carried out a thorough experimental evaluation using publicly available visual and vocal datasets. Results show that our proposed framework can achieve a high level of anonymization, while at the same time retain underlying data utility such that subsequent analyses on the anonymized biometric data could still be carried out to yield satisfactory accuracy.}

	abstract = {As secure messaging services become ubiquitous, the need for moderation tools that can function within these systems without defeating their purpose becomes more and more pressing. There are several solutions to deal with moderation on a local level, handling harassment and personal-scale issues, but handling wider-scale issues like disinformation campaigns narrows the field; traceback systems are designed for this, but most are incompatible with anonymity. In this paper, we present Anonymous Traceback, a traceback system capable of functioning within anonymous secure messaging systems. We carefully model security properties, provide two provably secure and simple constructions, with the most practical construction able to preserve anonymity for all but the original source of a reported abusive message. Our implementation shows integration to messaging systems such as Signal is feasible, with client-side overhead smaller than Signals’ sealed sender system, and low overhead overall.}

	abstract = {Public cloud data auditing allows any third party to check the integrity of data stored on untrusted cloud servers without retrieving the data. The challenge is how to audit the proof of storage with efficient communications. In ACM CCS 2007, Ateniese et al. described the first practical public cloud data auditing scheme based on RSA, in which the proof of storage consists of one RSA element and one hash value and the storage cost for generating the proof can be as short as \\(1\\%\\) of the stored file. Soon after, in Asiacrypt 2008, Shacham and Waters gave another public cloud data auditing scheme based on bilinear pairing, in which the generated proof of storage can be as short as 320 bits for 80-bit security (71\\(\\%\\) less compared to Ateniese et al.’s scheme). However, Shacham and Waters’ scheme must trade off the storage cost, where the storage overhead for generating the proof of storage must be \\(100\\%\\) of the stored file. Surprisingly, until today, the tradeoff between the proof size (namely proof of storage) and the storage cost (namely storage overhead) in cloud data auditing remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a completely new public cloud data auditing mechanism. The proof of storage is not computed from block tags directly, but from evolution tags that are still unforgeable and evolved from bunch tags. We propose a concrete public cloud data auditing scheme based on this mechanism, in which the proof size is 240 bits for 80-bit security (25\\(\\%\\) less compared to Shacham and Waters’ scheme) and the storage cost can be as efficient as Ateniese et al.’s scheme. The core of our technique is the feasibility of tag aggregations within this new mechanism. Our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model.}

	abstract = {Many practical secure systems have been designed to prevent real-world attacks via maximizing the attacking cost so as to reduce attack intentions. Inspired by this philosophy, we propose a new concept named delay encryption with keyword search (DEKS) to resist the notorious keyword guessing attack (KGA), in the context of secure cloud-based searchable services. Avoiding the use of complex (and unreasonable) assumptions, as compared to existing works, DEKS optionally leverages a catalyst that enables one (e.g., a valid data user) to easily execute encryption; without the catalyst, any unauthenticated system insiders and outsiders take severe time consumption on encryption. By this, DEKS can overwhelm a KGA attacker in the encryption stage before it obtains any advantage. We leverage the repeated squaring function, which is the core building block of our design, to construct the first DEKS instance. The experimental results show that DEKS is practical in thwarting KGA for both small and large-scale datasets. For example, in the Wikipedia, a KGA attacker averagely takes 7.23 years to break DEKS when the delay parameter \\(T=2^{24}\\). The parameter T can be flexibly adjusted based on practical needs, and theoretically, its upper bound is infinite.}

	abstract = {Gordon et al. (TCC 2015) systematically studied the security of Multi-client Verifiable Computation (MVC), in which a set of computationally-weak clients outsource the computation of a general function f over their private inputs to an untrusted server. They introduced the universally composable (UC) security of MVC and proposed a scheme achieving UC-security, where the protocol remains secure after arbitrarily composed with other UC-secure instances. However, the clients in their scheme have to undertake the heavy computation overhead caused by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and further, the plaintext size is linear to the function input size. In this work, we propose a more efficient UC-secure multi-client privacy-preserving verifiable computation protocol, called MVOC, that sharply reduces amortized overheads for clients, in both semi-honest and malicious settings. In particular, our protocol achieves stronger outsourcability by outsourcing more computation to the server, so that it may be more friendly to those lightweight clients. More specifically, we revisit the definition of garbling scheme, and propose a novel garbled circuit protocol whose circuit randomness is non-interactively provided by multiple parties. We also realize the idea of hybrid homomorphic encryption, which makes the FHE plaintext size independent of the input size. We present the detailed proof and analyze the theoretical complexity of MVOC. We further implement our protocol and evaluate the performance, and the results show that, after adopting our new techniques, the computation and communication overheads during input phase can be decreased by 55.15%–68.05% and 62.55%–75% respectively.\n}

	abstract = {Deep learning training is often outsourced to clouds due to its high computation overhead. However, clouds may not perform model training correctly due to the potential violations on Service Level Agreement (SLA) and attacks, incurring low quality of outsourced training. It is challenging for customers to understand the quality of outsourced training on clouds. They cannot measure the quality by simply testing the trained models because the testing performance is impacted by various factors, e.g., the quality of training and testing data. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that allows customers to verify the quality of outsourced training without modifying the processes of model training. Particularly, our framework achieves black-box verification by utilizing an extra training task that can be learned by the model only after the model converges on the original training task. We construct well-designed extra training tasks according to the original tasks, and develop a training quality verification method to measure the model performance on the extra task with a hypothesis testing-based threshold. The experiment results show that the models passing the quality verification achieve at least 96% of their best performance with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., less than 0.25%.\n}

	abstract = {Despite their maturity and popularity, security remains a critical concern in container adoption. To address this concern, secure container runtimes have emerged, offering superior guest isolation, as well as host protection, via system call policing through the surrogate kernel layer. Whether or not an adversary can bypass this protection depends on the effectiveness of the system call policy being enforced by the container runtime. In this work, we propose a novel method to quantify this container system call exposure. Our technique combines the analysis of a large number of exploit codes with comprehensive experiments designed to uncover the syscall pass-through behaviors of container runtimes. Our exploit code analysis uses information retrieval techniques to rank system calls by their risk weights. Our study shows that secure container runtimes are about 4.2 to 7.5 times more secure than others, using our novel quantification metric. We additionally uncover changing security trends across a 4.5\xa0year version history of the container runtimes.}

This motivates our main contribution, DyPrIs, a scalable process-isolation mechanism that only isolates suspicious worker scripts following a lightweight detection mechanism.

This paper explores ML-based access control’s administration problem, focusing on capturing changes in the access control state. We investigate this problem in a simulated system with Random Forest (RF) method from a symbolic ML class and the ResNet method from a non-symbolic one. Both classes have their respective advantages and disadvantages for issues such as insufficient learning of new changes and forgetting existing access information while updating the ML model. Our experimental results show that the non-symbolic approaches perform better than the symbolic ones while adjusting for continual (or incremental) changes in the access control state\n.}

	abstract = {Correctness and regulatory compliance of today’s software systems are crucial for our safety and security. This can be achieved with policy enforcement: the process of monitoring and possibly modifying system behavior to satisfy a given policy. The enforcer’s capabilities determine which policies are enforceable. We study the enforceability of policies specified in metric first-order temporal logic (MFOTL) with enforcers that can cause and suppress different system actions in real time. We consider an expressive safety fragment of MFOTL and show that a policy from that fragment is enforceable if and only if it is equivalent to a policy in a simpler, syntactically defined MFOTL fragment. We then propose an enforcement algorithm for all monitorable policies from the latter fragment, and show that our EnfPoly enforcer outperforms state-of-the-art tools.}

	abstract = {\nAndroid apps interact and exchange data with other apps through so-called app components. Previous research has shown that app components can cause application-level vulnerabilities, for example leading to data leakage across apps. Alternatively, apps can (intentionally or accidentally) expose their permissions (e.g. for camera and microphone) to other apps that lack these privileges. This causes a confused deputy situation, where a less privileged app exposes its app components, which use these permissions, to the victim app. While previous research mainly focused on these issues, less attention has been paid to how app components can affect the security and privacy guarantees of Android OS. In this paper, we demonstrate two according vulnerabilities, affecting recent Android versions. First, we show how app components can be used to leak data from and, in some cases, take full control of other Android user profiles, bypassing the dedicated lock screen. We demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability on major Android vendors (Samsung, Huawei, Google and Xiaomi). Secondly, we found that app components can be abused by spyware to access sensors like the camera and the microphone in the background up to Android 10, bypassing mitigations specifically designed to prevent this behaviour. Using a two-app setup, we find that app components can be invoked stealthily to e.g. periodically take pictures and audio recordings in the background. Finally, we present Four Gates Inspector, our open-source static analysis tool to systematically detect such issues for a large number of apps with complex codebases. Our tool successfully identified exposed components issues in 34 out 5,783 apps with average analysis runtime of 4.3\xa0s per app and, detected both known malware samples and unknown samples downloaded from the F-Droid repository. We responsibly disclosed all vulnerabilities presented in this paper to the affected vendors, leading to several CVE records and a currently unresolved high-severity issue in Android 10 and earlier.}

	abstract = {Consider a computer user who needs to update a piece of software installed on their computing device. To do so securely, a commonly accepted ad-hoc method stipulates that the old software version first retrieves the update information from the vendor’s public repository, then checks that a cryptographic signature embedded into it verifies with the vendor’s public key, and finally replaces itself with the new version. This updating method seems to be robust and lightweight, and to reliably ensure that no malicious third party (e.g., a distribution mirror) can inject harmful code into the update process. Unfortunately, recent prominent news reports (SolarWinds, Stuxnet, TikTok, Zoom,\xa0...) suggest that nation state adversaries are broadening their efforts related to attacking software supply chains. This calls for a critical re-evaluation of the described signature based updating method with respect to the real-world security it provides against particularly powerful adversaries. We approach the setting by formalizing a cryptographic primitive that addresses specifically the secure software updating problem. We define strong, rigorous security models that capture forward security (stealing a vendor’s key today doesn’t allow modifying yesterday’s software version) as well as a form of self-enforcement that helps protecting vendors against coercion attacks in which they are forced, e.g. by nation state actors, to misuse or disclose their keys. We note that the common signature based software authentication method described above meets neither the one nor the other goal, and thus represents a suboptimal solution. Hence, after formalizing the syntax and security of the new primitive, we propose novel, efficient, and provably secure constructions.\n}

	abstract = {We provide a strong definition for committing authenticated-encryption (cAE), as well as a framework that encompasses earlier and weaker definitions. The framework attends not only to what is committed but also the extent to which the adversary knows or controls keys. We slot into our framework strengthened cAE-attacks on GCM and OCB. Our main result is a simple and efficient construction, CTX, that makes a nonce-based AE (nAE) scheme committing. The transformed scheme achieves the strongest security notion in our framework. Just the same, the added computational cost (on top of the nAE scheme’s cost) is a single hash over a short string, a cost independent of the plaintext’s length. And there is no increase in ciphertext length compared to the base nAE scheme. That such a thing is possible, let alone easy, upends the (incorrect) intuition that you can’t commit to a plaintext or ciphertext without hashing one or the other. And it motivates a simple and practical tweak to AE-schemes to make them committing.\n}

	abstract = {Passwords are the most prevalent authentication mechanism, and proliferate on nearly every new web service. As users are overloaded with the tasks of managing dozens even hundreds of passwords, accordingly password-based single-sign-on (SSO) schemes have been proposed. In password-based SSO schemes, the authentication server needs to maintain a sensitive password file, which is an attractive target for compromise and poses a single point of failure. Hence, the notion of password-based threshold authentication (PTA) system has been proposed. However, a static PTA system is threatened by perpetual leakage (e.g., the adversary perpetually compromises servers). In addition, most of the existing PTA schemes are built on the intractability of conventional hard problems, and become insecure in the quantum era. In this work, we first propose a threshold oblivious pseudorandom function (TOPRF) to harden the password so that PTA schemes can resist offline password guessing attacks. Then, we employ the threshold homomorphic aggregate signature (THAS) over lattices to construct the first quantum-resistant password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication scheme with the updatable server private key. Our scheme resolves various issues arising from user corruption and server compromise, and it is formally proved secure against quantum adversaries. Comparison results show that our scheme is superior to its counterparts.}

	abstract = {Passwords are stored in the form of salted one-way hashes so that attacks on servers cannot leak them in the clear. However, humans tend to select passwords that are easy to remember, and a motivated attacker may attempt to hash quite large sets of easy passwords until a match is found with the target hash. Password cracking tools such as hashcat and john the ripper do this job very efficiently, using different forms of attacks that, for example, try passwords with a certain syntactic structure or passwords taken from a dictionary and mangled through appropriate rules. Recent work on password guessing has shown that machine learning can, in principle, outperform existing cracking tools in terms of success rate, by generating sophisticated password models. In this paper, we give password cracking tools a second chance, by exploring automated training techniques that aim to effectively improve the success rate. To achieve this ambitious goal, we carry out a systematic and in-depth analysis of various cracking strategies, and we propose a new combination of techniques that we train and test on a dataset of more than 700M real passwords. Our results show that, with this new approach, we can almost double the success rate, returning the primacy to password cracking tools. The techniques are general, repeatable and publicly available up to ethical constraints, providing a new benchmark for future research on password guessing.}

	abstract = {Fuzzy authenticated key exchange (FAKE) enables two parties to agree on a shared key with the help of their fuzzy sources, like biometric features [3, 9], physical unclonable functions (PUFs) [16], etc. In FAKE, each user will generate public strings from its own fuzzy source, and register public strings to the system. In the interactive protocol of FAKE, the user will again employ their own fuzzy sources to accomplish key agreement and achieve authenticity and privacy for the agreed session keys. The advantage of FAKE is that users do not have to store them in the devices, hence do not worry about key leakage due to bad key management in devices. In this paper, We propose a generic construction of FAKE from three building blocks including secure sketch (SS), key encapsulation scheme (KEM) and a digital signature (SIG). We also define authenticity for users and pseudo-randomness for session keys to formalize the security of FAKE in the multi-user multi-challenge setting. We prove the security of our FAKE construction with tight security reductions to the building blocks in the random oracle model. Given the available choices for SS, tightly secure KEM and tightly secure SIG schemes, we obtain a bunch of FAKE schemes with tight security in the multi-user multi-challenge setting.}

	abstract = {Secure messaging schemes such as the Signal protocol rely on out-of-band channels to verify the authenticity of long-running communication. Such out-of-band checks however are only rarely actually performed by users in practice. In this paper, we propose a new method for performing continuous authentication during a secure messaging session, without the need for an out-of-band channel. Leveraging the users’ long-term secrets, our Authentication Steps extension guarantees authenticity as long as long-term secrets are not compromised, strengthening Signal’s post-compromise security. Our mechanism further allows to detect a potential compromise of long-term secrets after the fact via an out-of-band channel. Our protocol comes with a novel, formal security definition capturing continuous authentication, a general construction for Signal-like protocols, and a security proof for the proposed instantiation. We further provide a prototype implementation which seamlessly integrates on top of the official Signal Java library, together with bandwidth and storage overhead benchmarks.\n}

	abstract = {An aggregate signature (AS) scheme allows an unspecified aggregator to compress many signatures into a short aggregation. AS schemes can save storage costs and accelerate verification. They are desirable for applications where many signatures need to be stored, transferred, or verified together, including blockchain systems, sensor networks, certificate chains, network routing, etc. However, constructing AS schemes based on general groups, only requiring the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem, is quite tricky and has been a long-standing research question. Recently, Chalkias et al. [6] proposed a half-aggregate scheme for Schnorr signatures. We observe the scheme lacks a tight security proof and does not well support incremental aggregation, i.e., adding more signatures into a pre-existing aggregation. This work’s contributions are threefold. We first give a tight security proof for the scheme in [6] in the ROM and the algebraic group model (AGM). Second, we provide a new half-aggregate scheme for Schnorr signatures that perfectly supports incremental aggregation, whose security also tightly reduces to Schnorr’s security in the AGM+ROM. Third, we present a Schnorr-based sequential aggregate signature (SAS) scheme that is tightly secure as Schnorr signature scheme in the ROM (without the AGM). Our work may pave the way for applying Schnorr aggregation in real-world cryptographic applications.\n}

	abstract = {\nAnonymous authentication primitives, e.g., group or ring signatures, allow one to realize privacy-preserving data collection applications, as they strike a balance between authenticity of data being collected and privacy of data providers. At PKC 2021, Diaz and Lehmann defined group signatures with User-Controlled Linkability (UCL) and provided an instantiation based on BBS+ signatures. In a nutshell, a signer of a UCL group signature scheme can link any of her signatures: linking evidence can be produced at signature time, or after signatures have been output, by providing an explicit linking proof. In this paper, we introduce Ring Signatures with User-Controlled Linkability (RS-UCL). Compared to group signatures with user-controlled linkability, RS-UCL require no group manager and can be instantiated in a completely decentralized manner. We also introduce a variation, User Controlled and Autonomous Linkability (RS-UCAL), which gives the user full control of the linkability of their signatures. We provide a formal model for both RS-UCL and RS-UCAL and introduce a compiler that can upgrade any ring signature scheme to RS-UCAL. The compiler leverages a new primitive we call Anonymous Key Randomizable Signatures (AKRS)—a signature scheme where the verification key can be randomized—that can be of independent interest. We also provide different instantiations of AKRS based on Schnorr signatures and on lattices. Finally, we show that an AKRS scheme can additionally be used to construct an RS-UCL scheme.}

	abstract = {A linkable ring signature allows a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a group while ensuring that multiple signatures from the same user are detected. Applications such as privacy-preserving e-voting and e-cash can leverage linkable ring signatures to significantly improve privacy and anonymity guarantees. To scale to systems involving large numbers of users, short signatures with fast verification are a must. Concretely efficient ring signatures currently rely on a trusted authority maintaining a master secret, or follow an accumulator-based approach that requires a trusted setup. In this work, we construct the first linkable ring signature with both logarithmic signature size and verification that does not require any trusted mechanism. Our scheme, which relies on discrete-log type assumptions and bilinear maps, improves upon a recent concise ring signature called DualRing by integrating improved preprocessing arguments to reduce the verification time from linear to logarithmic in the size of the ring. Our ring signature allows signatures to be linked based on what message is signed, ranging from linking signatures on any message to only signatures on the same message. We provide benchmarks for our scheme and prove its security under standard assumptions. The proposed linkable ring signature is particularly relevant to use cases that require privacy-preserving enforcement of threshold policies in a fully decentralized context, and e-voting.\n}

	abstract = {Unique ring signatures (URS) were introduced by Franklin and Zhang (FC 2012) as a unification of linkable and traceable ring signatures. In URS, each member within a ring can only produce, on behalf of the ring, at most one signature for a message. Applications of URS potentially are e–voting systems and e–token systems. In blockchain technology, URS have been implemented for mixing contract. However, existing URS schemes are based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem, which is insecure in the post-quantum setting. In this paper, we design a new lattice-based URS scheme where the signature size is logarithmic in number of ring members. The proposed URS exploits a Merkle tree-based accumulator as building block in the lattice setting. Our scheme is secure under the Short Integer Solution and Learning With Rounding assumptions in the random oracle model.\n}

	abstract = {Decentralized cryptocurrencies still suffer from three interrelated weaknesses: Low transaction rates, high transaction fees, and long confirmation times. Payment Channels promise to be a solution to these issues, and many constructions for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereuem, are known. Somewhat surprisingly, no solution is known for Monero, the largest privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, without requiring system-wide changes like a hard-fork of its blockchain like prior solutions. In this work, we close this gap for Monero by presenting the first provably secure payment channel protocol that is fully compatible with Monero’s transaction scheme. Notably, the payment channel related transactions are identical to standard transactions in Monero, therefore not hampering the coins’ fungibility. With standard techniques, our payment channels can be extended to support atomic swap of tokens in Monero with tokens of several other major currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc., in a fungible and privacy-preserving manner. Our main technical contribution is a new cryptographic tool called verifiable timed linkable ring signatures (VTLRS), where linkable ring signatures can be hidden for a pre-determined amount of time in a verifiable way. We present a practically efficient construction of VTLRS which is fully compatible with the transaction scheme of Monero, and allows for users to make timed payments to the future which might be of independent interest to develop other applications on Monero. Our implementation results show that even with high network latency and with a single CPU core, two regular users can perform up to 93500 payments over 2\xa0min (the block production rate of Monero). This is approximately five orders of magnitude improvement over the current payment rate of Monero.}

	abstract = {Adaptor signatures are a new cryptographic primitive that binds the authentication of a message to the revelation of a secret value. In recent years, this primitive has gained increasing popularity both in academia and practice due to its versatile use-cases in different Blockchain applications such as atomic swaps and payment channels. The security of these applications, however, crucially relies on users storing and maintaining the secret values used by adaptor signatures in a secure way. For standard digital signature schemes, cryptographic wallets have been introduced to guarantee secure storage of keys and execution of the signing procedure. However, no prior work has considered cryptographic wallets for adaptor signatures. In this work, we introduce the notion of adaptor wallets. Adaptor wallets allow parties to securely use and maintain adaptor signatures in the Blockchain setting. Our adaptor wallets are both deterministic and operate in the hot/cold paradigm, which was first formalized by Das et al.\xa0 (CCS 2019) for standard signature schemes. We introduce a new cryptographic primitive called adaptor signatures with rerandomizable keys, and use it to generically construct adaptor wallets. We further show how to instantiate adaptor signatures with rerandomizable keys from the ECDSA signature scheme and discuss that they can likely be built for Schnorr and Katz-Wang schemes as well. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the existing ECDSA- and Schnorr-based adaptor signatures w.r.t.\xa0 deterministic wallets in the hot/cold setting and prove that it is impossible to overcome these drawbacks given the current state-of-the-art design of adaptor signatures.}

	abstract = {Puncturable signature (PS), proposed by Bellare, Stepanovs and Waters at EUROCRYPT 2016, is a special kind of digital signature that supports a fine-grained revocation of signing capacity by updating the secret key with selective messages. Puncturable signature has many usages like asynchronous transaction data signing services and proof-of-stake blockchain protocols. Meanwhile, it is an essential building block in constructing disappearing signatures in the bounded storage model. In this paper, we propose the first generic construction of puncturable signature from identity-based signature by treating identities as prefixes. With the help of our generic framework, we present different puncturable signature instantiations over lattices, bilinear maps, and multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC). Specifically, the lattice-based instantiation is based on the short integer solution (SIS) assumption and is proven secure in the random oracle model. Besides, the pairing-based instantiation is based on the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption and is proven secure in the standard model. In addition, we show that the instantiation over MPKC is secure under current attacks.}

	abstract = {The address space layout randomization (ASLR) has been widely deployed on modern operating systems against code reuse attacks (CRAs) such as return-oriented programming (ROP) and return-to-libc. However, porting ASLR to resource-constrained IoT devices is a great challenge due to the limited memory space. We propose a function-based ASLR scheme (fASLR) for IoT runtime security utilizing the ARM TrustZone-M technique and the memory protection unit (MPU). fASLR loads a function from the flash and randomizes its entry address in a randomization region in RAM when the function is called. We design novel mechanisms on cleaning up finished functions from the RAM and memory addressing to deal with the complexity of function relocation and randomization. Compared with related work, a prominent advantage of fASLR is that fASLR can run an application even if the application code cannot be completely loaded into RAM for execution. We test fASLR with 21 applications. fASLR achieves high randomization entropy and incurs runtime overhead of less than 10%.}

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) cyber threats such as jackware\xa0[14] and cryptomining\xa0[33] show that insecure IoT devices can be exploited by attackers with different goals. As many such attacks are multi-steps, early detection is critical. Early detection enables early attack containment and response, and prevention of malware propagation. However, it is challenging to detect early-phase attacks with both high precision and high recall as attackers typically attempt to evade the detection systems with stealthy or zero-day attacks. To enhance the security of IoT devices, we propose IoTEDef, a deep learning-based system able to identify the infection events and evolve with the identified infections. IoTEDef understands multi-step attacks based on cyber kill chains and maintains detectors for each step. When it detects anomalies related to a later stage of the kill chain, IoTEDef backtracks the log of events and analyzes these events to identify infection events. Then, IoTEDef updates its infection detector with the identified events. IoTEDef can be used for threat hunting as well as the generation of indicators of compromise and attacks. To show its feasibility, we implement a prototype of the system and evaluate it against the Mirai botnet campaign\xa0[2] and the multi-step attack that exploits the Log4j vulnerability\xa0[36] to infect the IoT devices. Our results show that the F1-score of our evolved infection detector in IoTEDef, instantiated with long short-term memory (LSTM) and the attention mechanism, increases from 0.31 to 0.87 . We also show that existing attention-based NIDSes can benefit from our approach.}

	abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly important role in real life, the concern about IoT malware and botnet attacks is considerably growing. Meanwhile, with new techniques such as edge computing and artificial intelligence applied to IoT networks, these devices nowadays become more functional than ever before, which challenges many existing network anomaly detection systems due to the lack of generalization ability to profile diverse activities. To address it, this paper proposes IoTEnsemble, an ensemble network anomaly detection framework. We propose a tree-based activity clustering method that aggregates network flows dedicated to the same activity so that their traffic patterns remain identical. Based on the clustering result, we implement an ensemble model in which each submodel only needs to profile a specific activity, which highly reduces the burden of a single model’s generalization ability. For evaluation, we build a 57.1\xa0GB IoT dataset collected in 9 months composed of comprehensive normal and malicious traffic. Our evaluation proves that IoTEnsemble possesses a state-of-the-art detection performance on various IoT botnet malware and attack traffic, exhibiting a significantly better result than other baselines in a more intelligent and functional IoT network.}

While privacy policies are required to describe how IoT apps use private user data (i.e., data practice), problems such as missing, inaccurate, and inconsistent policies have been repeatedly reported. Therefore, it is important to assess the actual data practice in IoT apps and identify the potential gaps between the actual and declared data usage. In this work, we conducted a measurement study using our framework called IoTPrivComp, which applies an automated analysis of IoT apps’ code and privacy policies to identify compliance gaps. We collected 1,489 IoT apps with English privacy policies from the Play Store. IoTPrivComp\xa0found 532 apps with sensitive external data flows, among which 408 (76.7%) apps had undisclosed data leaks. Moreover, 63.4% of the data flows that involved health and wellness data was inconsistent with the practices disclosed in the apps’ privacy policies.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of speech recognition techniques, AI-powered voice assistants become ubiquitous. However, it also increases privacy concerns regarding users’ voice recordings. User-level membership inference detects whether a service provider misused users’ audio to build its Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model without users’ consent. Previous research assumes the model’s outputs, including its label (i.e., transcription) and confidence score, are available for security auditing. However, the model’s outputs are unavailable in many real-world cases, i.e., no-label black-box scenarios, which is a big challenge. We propose a substitute model analysis to transfer the knowledge of the service system to that of its built-in ASR model’s behavior with semantic analysis techniques. Based on this analysis, our auditor can determine the user-level membership with high accuracy (\\(\\sim \\)80%) by utilizing a shadow system technique and a gap inference method. The gap inference-based auditor is generic and independent of ASR models.}

	abstract = {In most verifiable electronic voting schemes, one key step is the tally phase, where the election result is computed from the encrypted ballots. A generic technique consists in first applying (verifiable) mixnets to the ballots and then revealing all the votes in the clear. This however discloses much more information than the result of the election itself (that is, the winners, plus possibly some information required by law) and may offer the possibility to coerce voters. In this paper, we present a collection of building blocks for designing tally-hiding schemes based on multi-party computations. From these building blocks, we design a fully tally-hiding scheme for Condorcet elections. Our implementation shows that the approach is practical, at least for medium-size elections. Similarly, we provide the first tally-hiding schemes with no leakage for three important counting functions: D’Hondt, STV, and Majority Judgment. We prove that they can be used to design a private and verifiable voting scheme. We also unveil unknown flaws or leakage in some previously proposed tally-hiding schemes.}

	abstract = {The verifiable encryption of bits is the main computational step that is needed to prepare ballots in many practical voting protocols. Its computational load can also be a practical bottleneck, preventing the deployment of some protocols or requiring the use of computing clusters. We investigate the question of producing many verifiably encrypted bits in an efficient and portable way, using as a baseline the protocol that is in use in essentially all modern voting systems and libraries supporting homomorphic voting, including ElectionGuard, a state-of-the-art open source voting SDK deployed in government elections. Combining fixed base exponentiation techniques and new encryption and ZK proof mechanisms, we obtain speed-ups by more than one order of magnitude against standard implementations. Our exploration requires balancing conflicting optimization strategies, and the use of asymptotically less efficient protocols that turn out to be very effective in practice. Several of our proposed improvements are now on the ElectionGuard roadmap.}

	abstract = {The emergence of distributed digital currencies has raised the need for a reliable consensus mechanism. In proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, the participants periodically choose a closed set of validators, who can vote and append transactions to the blockchain. Each validator can become a leader with the probability proportional to its stake. Keeping the leader private yet unique until it publishes a new block can significantly reduce the attack vector of an adversary and improve the throughput of the network. The problem of Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE) was first formally defined by Boneh et al. in 2020. In this work, we propose a novel framework for constructing SSLE protocols, which relies on secure multi-party computation (MPC) and satisfies the desired security properties. Our framework does not use any shuffle or sort operations and has a computational cost for N parties as low as O(N) of basic MPC operations per party. We improve the state-of-the-art for SSLE protocols that do not assume a trusted setup. Moreover, our SSLE scheme efficiently handles weighted elections. That is, for a total weight S of N parties, the associated costs are only increased by a factor of \\(\\log {S}\\). When the MPC layer is instantiated with techniques based on Shamir’s secret-sharing, our SSLE has a communication cost of \\(O(N^2)\\) which is spread over \\(O(\\log {N})\\) rounds, can tolerate up to \\(t<N/2\\) of faulty nodes without restarting the protocol, and its security relies on DDH in the random oracle model. When the MPC layer is instantiated with more efficient techniques based on garbled circuits, our SSLE requires all parties to participate, up to \\(N-1\\) of which can be malicious, and its security is based on the random oracle model.}

	abstract = {ARM-based (mobile) devices are more popular than ever. They are used to access, process, and store confidential information and participate in sensitive authentication protocols, making them extremely attractive targets. Many attacks focus on compromising the primary operating system – for example, by convincing the user to download OS rootkits concealed within seemingly innocent apps. To partially mitigate the impact, device manufacturers responded by offering hardware-rooted trusted environments (TEEs). Yet, making use of TEEs (e.g., by securely porting existing apps) is not easy. Only a small number of security-critical applications make use of TEEs, leaving all others to run on a potentially vulnerable OS, under the control of users that all too often fall prey to cleverly disguised malware. AppBastion is a general-purpose platform that leverages the now ubiquitous ARM TrustZone TEE to secure application data from untrusted OSes. AppBastion enables applications to maintain confidential data in memory regions protected even from a compromised OS. Only approved, signed applications can access their associated protected memory regions. Data never leaves protected regions unencrypted and applications can communicate or declassify protected data only through explicit AppBastion channels. AppBastion ensures that application confidential data cannot be accessed, spoofed, or leaked by the OS.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the deployment of charging infrastructures has been increasing exponentially due to the high energy demand of electric vehicles, forming complex charging networks. These networks pave the way for the emergence of new unknown threats in both the energy and transportation sectors. Economic damages and energy theft are the most frequent risks in these environments. Thus, this paper aims to present a solution capable of accurately detecting unforeseen events and possible fraud threats that arise during charging sessions at charging stations through the current capabilities of the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, these algorithms have the drawback of not fitting well in large networks and generating a high number of false positives and negatives, mainly due to the mismatch with the distribution of data over time. For that reason, a Collaborative Anomaly Detection System for Charging Stations (here referred to as CADS4CS) is proposed as an optimization measure. CADS4CS has a central analysis unit that coordinates a group of independent anomaly detection systems to provide greater accuracy using a voting algorithm. In addition, CADS4CS has the feature of continuously retraining ML models in a collaborative manner to ensure that they are adjusted to the distribution of the data. To validate the approach, different use cases and practical studies are addressed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution.}
