	abstract = {In this work we study a promising approach for efficient online scheduling of job-flows in high performance and distributed parallel computing. The majority of job-flow optimization approaches, including backfilling and microscheduling, require apriori knowledge of a full job queue to make the optimization decisions. In a more general scenario when user jobs are submitted individually, the resources selection and allocation should be performed immediately in the online mode. In this work we consider a neural network prototype model trained to perform online optimization decisions based on a known optimal solution. For this purpose, we designed MLAK algorithm which implements 0–1 knapsack problem based on the apriori unknown utility function. In a dedicated simulation experiments with different utility functions MLAK provides resources selection efficiency comparable to a classical greedy algorithm.}

	abstract = {The cyber threats are often found to threaten individuals, organizations and countries at different levels and evolve continuously over time. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective approach to solve cyber security problems. However, existing processes are considered inherent responses to known threats. CTI experts recommend proactively checking for emerging threats in existing knowledge. In addition, most researches focus on static snapshots of the CTI knowledge graph, while ignoring the temporal dynamics. To this end, we create a novel framework TSA-TNTM (Time Series Attention based Transformer Neural Turing Machines) for diachronic graph embedding framework, which uses time series self-attention mechanism to capture the non-linearly evolving entity representations over time. We demonstrate significantly improved performance over various approaches. A series of benchmark experiments illustrate that TSA-TNTM could generate higher quality than the state-of-the-art word embedding models in tasks pertaining to semantic analogy, clustering, threat classification and proactively identify emerging threats in CTI fields.}

	abstract = {For high-dimensional dynamical systems, running high-fidelity physical simulations can be computationally expensive. Much research effort has been devoted to develop efficient algorithms which can predict the dynamics in a low-dimensional reduced space. In this paper, we developed a modular approach which makes use of different reduced-order modelling for data compression. Machine learning methods are then carried out in the reduced space to learn the dynamics of the physical systems. Furthermore, with the help of data assimilation, the proposed modular approach can also incorporate observations to perform real-time corrections with a low computational cost. In the present work, we applied this modular approach to the forecasting of wildfire, air pollution and fluid dynamics. Using the machine learning surrogate model instead of physics-based simulations will speed up the forecast process towards a real-time solution while keeping the prediction accuracy. The data-driven algorithm schemes introduced in this work can be easily applied/extended to other dynamical systems.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the Machine Learning (ML) approach is needful to many research fields. Among these, the Environmental Science (ES) which involves a large amount of data to be processed and collected. On the other hand, in order to provide a reliable output, those data information must be assimilated. Since this process requires a large execution time when the input dataset is very huge, here we propose a parallel GPU algorithm based on a curve fitting method, to filter the starting dataset, by exploiting the computational power of the CUDA tool. The innovative aspect of the proposed procedure can be used in several application fields. Our experiments show the achieved results in terms of performance.}

	abstract = {The paper presents computational schemes of the multipoint meshless method – the numerical modeling tool that allows accurate and effective solving of boundary value problems. The main advantage of the multipoint general version is its generality – the basic relations of derivatives from the unknown function depend on the domain discretization only and are independent of the type of problem being solved. This feature allows to divide the multipoint computational strategy into two stages and is advantageous from the calculation efficiency point of view. The multipoint method algorithms applied to such engineering problems as numerical homogenization of heterogeneous materials and nonlinear analysis are developed and briefly presented. The paper is illustrated by several examples of the multipoint numerical analysis. }

	abstract = {Tightly coupled task-based multiscale models do not scale when implemented using a traditional workflow management system. This is because the fine-grained task parallelism of such applications cannot be exploited efficiently due to scheduling and communication overheads. Existing tools and frameworks allow implementing efficient task-level parallelism, however with high programming effort. On the other hand, Dask and Parsl are Python libraries for low-effort up-scaling of task-parallel applications but still require considerable programming effort and do not equally provide functions for optimal task scheduling. By extending the wfGenes tool with new generators and a static task graph scheduler, we enhance Dask and Parsl to tackle these deficiencies and to generate optimized input for these systems from a simple application description and enable rapid design of scalable task-parallel multiscale applications relying on thorough graph analysis and automatic code generation. The performance of the generated code has been analyzed by using random task graphs with up to 10,000 nodes and executed on thousands of CPU cores. The approach implemented in wfGenes is beneficial for improving the usability and increasing the exploitation of existing tools, and for increasing productivity of multiscale modeling scientists.}

	abstract = {Agent-based models (ABM) simulate individual, micro-level decision making to predict macro-scale emergent behaviour patterns. In this paper, we use ABM for forced displacement to predict the distribution of refugees fleeing from northern Ethiopia to Sudan. Since Ethiopia has more than 950,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and is home to 96,000 Eritrean refugees in four camps situated in the Tigray region, we model refugees, IDPs and Eritrean refugees. It is the first time we attempt such integration, but we believe it is important because IDPs and Eritrean refugees could become refugees fleeing to Sudan. To provide more accurate predictions, we review and revise the key assumptions in the Flee simulation code that underpin the model, and draw on new information from data collection activities. Our initial simulation predicts more than 75% of the movements of forced migrants correctly in absolute terms with the average relative error of 0.45. Finally, we aim to forecast movement patterns, destination preferences among displaced populations and emerging trends for destinations in Sudan.}

We show different methods of reduction of discrete logarithm problem over prime fields to the QUBO problem. In the best case, if n is the bitlength of a characteristic of the prime field \\(\\mathbb F_p\\), there are required approximately \\(2n^2\\) logical qubits for such reduction. We present practical attacks on discrete logarithm problem over the 4-bit prime field \\(\\mathbb F_{11}\\), over 5-bit prime field \\(\\mathbb F_{23}\\) and over 6-bit prime field \\(\\mathbb F_{59}\\). We solved these problems using D-Wave Advantage QPU. It is worth noting that, according to our knowledge, until now, no one has made a practical attack on discrete logarithm over the prime field using quantum methods.}

	abstract = {Compressive sensing is a signal processing technique used to acquire and reconstruct sparse signals using significantly fewer measurement samples. Compressive sensing requires finding the most sparse solution to an underdetermined linear system, which is an NP-hard problem and as a consequence in practise is only solved approximately. In our work we restrict ourselves to the compressive sensing problem for the case of binary signals. For that case we have defined an equivalent formulation in terms of a quadratic binary optimisation (QUBO) problem, which we solve using classical and (hybrid-)quantum computing solving techniques based on quantum annealing. Phase transition diagrams show that this approach significantly improves the number of problem types that can be successfully reconstructed when compared to a more conventional \\(\\mathcal {L}_1\\) optimisation method. A challenge that remain is how to select optimal penalty parameters in the QUBO formulation as was shown can heavily impact the quality of the solution.}

	abstract = {There are several Toffoli gate designs for quantum computers in the literature. Each of these designs is focused on a specific technology or on optimising one or several metrics (T-count, number of qubits, etc.), and therefore has its advantages and disadvantages. While there is some consensus in the state of the art on the best implementations for the Toffoli gate, scaling this gate for use with three or more control qubits is not trivial. In this paper, we analyse the known techniques for constructing an n-qubit Toffoli gate, as well as the existing state-of-the-art designs for the 2-qubit version, which is an indispensable building block for the larger gates. In particular, we are interested in a construction of the temporary logical-AND gate with more than two control qubits. This gate is widely used in the literature due to the T-count and qubit reduction it provides. However, its use with more than two control qubits has not been analysed in detail in any work. The resulting information is offered in the form of comparative tables that will facilitate its consultation for researchers and people interested in the subject, so that they can easily choose the design that best suits their interests. As part of this work, the studied implementations have been reproduced and tested on both quantum simulators and real quantum devices.}

	abstract = {Quantum optimal control problems are typically solved by gradient-based algorithms such as GRAPE, which suffer from exponential growth in storage with increasing number of qubits and linear growth in memory requirements with increasing number of time steps. These memory requirements are a barrier for simulating large models or long time spans. We have created a nonstandard automatic differentiation technique that can compute gradients needed by GRAPE by exploiting the fact that the inverse of a unitary matrix is its conjugate transpose. Our approach significantly reduces the memory requirements for GRAPE, at the cost of a reasonable amount of recomputation. We present benchmark results based on an implementation in JAX.}

	abstract = {Algebraic attacks using quantum annealing are a new idea of cryptanalysis. This paper shows how to obtain a QUBO problem equivalent to the algebraic attack on the Speck cipher, using as small a number of logical variables as possible. The main idea of minimizing the number of variables in the algebraic attack on this ARX cipher was appropriate cipher partition and insertion of additional variables. Using such an idea, in the case of the most popular variants: Speck-128/128 and Speck-128/256, the equivalent QUBO problem has 19,311 and 33,721 logical variables, which is more efficient than the same attack on AES cipher, where for AES-128 and AES-256, an equivalent QUBO problem consist of 29,770 and 72,597 logical variables, respectively. It is an open question if this kind of attack may overtake, in some cases, brutal or Grover’s attack.\n}

	abstract = {Quantum computing, in particular Quantum Annealing (QA), provides a theoretically promising alternative to classical methods for solving combinatorially difficult optimization problems. In particular, QA is suitable for problems that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, such as SAT, graph colouring and travelling salesman. With commercially available QA hardware, like that offered by D-Wave Systems (D-Wave), reaching scales capable of tackling real world problems, it is timely to assess and benchmark the performance of this current generation of hardware. This paper empirically investigates the performance of D-Wave’s 2000Q (2048 qubits) and Advantage (5640 qubits) quantum annealers in solving a specific instance of the maximum cardinality matching problem, building on the results of a prior paper that investigated the performance of earlier QA hardware from D-Wave. We find that the Advantage quantum annealer is able to produce optimal solutions to larger problem instances than the 2000Q. We further consider the problem’s structure and its implications for suitability to QA by utilising the Landau-Zener formula to explore the potential scaling of the diabatic transition probability. We propose a method to investigate the behaviour of minimum energy gaps for scalable problems deployed to quantum annealers. We find that the minimum energy gap for our target QA problem does not scale favourably. This behaviour raises questions as to the suitability of this problem for benchmarking QA hardware, as it potentially lacks the nuance required to identify meaningful performance improvements between generations.}

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a powerful concept in the technological world that is critically valued in information security due to its enhanced computation powers. Researchers have developed algorithms that allow quantum computers to hack into information security concepts that were previously considered difficult, if not impossible, including asymmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. Studies have been done to focus on improving security protocols through quantum computing to counter these vulnerabilities. One such focus is on the topic of quantum authentication (QA). However, while several QA protocols have been theorized, only a few have been implemented and further tested. Among the protocols, we selected and implemented five quantum authentication protocols to determine their feasibility in a real-world setting. In this late-breaking work, we discuss the difficulties and obstacles developers might face while implementing authentication protocols that use quantum computing.}

	abstract = {Error correction is wide and well elaborated area of quantum information theory. Those methods, however, demand additional resources, like quantum gates, qubits or time. We have observed, in statistical sense, that the qubit’s error in real quantum computers, once calibrated doesn’t change much until next one. Then being so, for quantum sampling based computations, one can determine the correction experimentally and use it until the next calibration, without a need of utilize additional resources. In this work we present the method of determining such a correction and applying it to practical quantum-sampling algorithms. Quantum sampling is the method, which we deliberately decline to obtain one deterministic result of one-shot computation in. Instead of that, we provide a number of same experiments. Then we observe the probability distribution function (PDF) thus obtained, which is considered as the final result of computation. We have observed and experimentally proved in this work, that error of this probability distribution is correlated with the local quantum phase of qubits involved in computations. Hence we are able to create a Phase Distortion Unraveling (PDU) function for each qubit and for whole system as well, that depends on this phase. Briefly, the final result after correction is the sum of PDF and PDU.}

We consider the maximization problem of determining the most expensive path in a control flow graph. In these graphs, vertices represent blocks of code whose execution times are fixed and known in advance. We port the considered optimization problem to the quantum framework by expressing it as a QUBO. We then experimentally compare the performances in solving the problem of classic Simulated Annealing (SA), Quantum Annealing (QA), and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Our experiments suggest that QA represents a fast equivalent of simulated annealing. Indeed, we measured the approximation ratio on the results of QA and SA, showing that their performances are comparable, at least on our set of simplified problems.}

	abstract = {The discovery of quantum algorithms that may have an impact on cryptography is one of the main reasons of the rise of quantum computing. Currently, all quantum cryptanalysis techniques are purely theoretical and none of them can be executed on existing or near-term quantum devices. So, this paper investigates the capability of already existing quantum computers to attack a toy block cipher (namely the Heys cipher) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Starting from a known-plaintext key recovery problem, we transform it into an instance of the MAX-SAT problem. Then, we propose two ways to implement it in a QAOA circuit and we try to solve it using publicly available IBM Q Experience quantum computers. The results suggest that the limited number of qubits requires the use of exponential algorithms to achieve the transformation of our problem into a MAX-SAT instance and, despite encouraging simulation results, that the corresponding quantum circuit is too deep to work on nowadays (too-)noisy gate-based quantum computers.}

It becomes a major bottleneck when these rules have to be updated in real-time in response to changes in the manufacturing environment. Machine Learning (ML) based solutions for this problem are considered to be state-of-the-art. However, their accuracy and correctness depend on the availability of high-quality training data. To address the shortcomings of the ML-based approaches, we propose a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation for the MDR scheduling problem. A novel aspect of our formulation is that it can be efficiently solved on a quantum annealer. We solve the proposed formulation on a production quantum annealer from D-Wave and compare the results with single dispatch rule based baseline model.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning on quantum computers have been made possible mainly by two discoveries. Mapping the features into exponentially large Hilbert spaces makes them linearly separable—quantum circuits perform linear operations only. The parameter-shift rule allows for easy computation of objective function gradients on quantum hardware—a classical optimizer can then be used to find its minimum. This allows us to build a binary variational quantum classifier that shows some advantages over the classical one. In this paper we extend this idea to building a multi-class classifier and apply it to real data. A systematic study involving several feature maps and classical optimizers as well as different repetitions of the parametrized circuits is presented. The accuracy of the model is compared both on a simulated environment and on a real IBM quantum computer.}

	abstract = {Finding the\xa0ground state of the\xa0Ising model is an important problem in condensed matter physics. Its applications spread far beyond physic due to its deep relation to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as travelling salesman or protein folding. Sophisticated new methods for solving Ising instances rely on quantum annealing, which is a paradigm of quantum computation. However, commercially available quantum annealers are still prone to errors, and their ability to find low energetic states is limited. This naturally calls for a post-processing procedure to correct errors. As a proof-of-concept, this work combines the\xa0recent ideas revolving around the\xa0DIRAC architecture with the\xa0Chimera topology and applies them in a real-world setting as an error-correcting scheme for D-Wave quantum annealers. Our preliminary results show how to correct states output by quantum annealers using reinforcement learning. Our approach exhibits excellent scalability, as it can be trained on small instances. However, its performance on the Chimera graphs is still inferior to Monte Carlo methods.}

	abstract = {Solving general non-linear partial differential equations (PDE) precisely and efficiently has been a long-lasting challenge in the field of scientific computing. Based on the deep learning framework for solving non-linear PDEs physics-informed neural networks (PINN), we introduce an adaptive collocation strategy into the PINN method to improve the effectiveness and robustness of this algorithm when selecting the initial data to be trained. Instead of merely training the neural network once, multi-step discrete time models are considered when predicting the long time behaviour of solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation. Numerical results concerning solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation are presented, which demonstrate that this approach can improve the robustness of original neural networks approximation.}

	abstract = {This work presents Direct Numerical Simulation of mass transfer in a bi-dispersed bubble swarm at high Reynolds number, by using a multiple marker level-set method. Transport equations are discretized by the finite-volume method on 3D collocated unstructured meshes. Interface capturing is performed by the unstructured conservative level-set method, whereas the multiple marker approach avoids the so-called numerical coalescence of bubbles. Pressure-velocity coupling is solved by the classical fractional-step projection method. Diffusive terms are discretized by a central difference scheme. Convective term of momentum equation, level-set equations, and mass transfer equation, are discretized by unstructured flux-limiters schemes. This approach improves the numerical stability of the unstructured multiphase solver in bubbly flows with high Reynolds number and high-density ratio. Finally, this numerical model is applied to research the effect of bubble-bubble interactions on the mass transfer in a bi-dispersed bubble swarm.}

In this algorithm the velocity field for solid domain is interpolated into fluid velocity field through an appropriate \\(L^2\\) projection, then the resulting combined equations are solved simultaneously (rather than sequentially). We parallelize the finite element discretization of spatial variables for fluid governing equations and linear system solver to accelerate the computation.

	abstract = {In enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes, foam injection reduces gas mobility and increases apparent viscosity, thus increasing recovery efficiency. The quantification of uncertainty is essential in developing and evaluating mathematical models. In this work, we perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) of two-phase flow models for foam injection using the STARS model with data from a series of foam quality-scan experiments. We first performed the parameter estimation based on three datasets of foam quality-scans on Indiana limestone carbonate core samples. Then distributions of the parameters are inferred via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC). This approach allows propagating parametric uncertainty to the STARS apparent viscosity model. In particular, the framework for UQ allowed us to identify how the lack of experimental data affected the reliability of the calibrated models.}

In this study, concerning the work of Becker et al., we performed three-dimensional unsteady simulations of an infinite array of airfoils, which is one of the models of schooling, and we clarified the structure of the flow between them. The model velocities obtained from the simulations show a good correspondence with the experimental data of Becker et al. The vortex structure created by the airfoil is very complicated, and it is visually clear that the vortices generated from the left and right ends of the airfoil also contribute to the formation of the upward and downward flows. \n}

	abstract = {This study achieves modelling two helicopters via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and simulating the flow field that develops due to a near miss. The rotation of the main rotor and the translational movement of the helicopter are modelled in this study, and the long trajectory of the moving helicopter is realised in the simulation. Moreover, the interaction of flows around the two moving helicopters is also achieved by introducing the communication between multiple moving computational domains. Firstly, the validation test is conducted using a helicopter model with a rotating main rotor, where the results produced by our in-house code are compared with those computed by another CFD solver, FaSTAR-Move. This test verifies that the communication between the overlapping grids is reliably achieved in our simulation. In the simulation of nearly missing helicopters, two near-miss cases are computationally demonstrated, where the complex flow field which develops around the two helicopters is captured, and the disturbance in aerodynamic and moment coefficients exerted on the helicopters are observed. These results confirm the capability of this CFD approach for realising near-miss events on a computer. }

	abstract = {To push out a blood flow to an aorta, a left ventricle repeats expansion and contraction motion. For more efficient pumping of the blood, it is known that the left ventricle also has twisted motion. In this paper, the influence of the twisted motion for a blood flow to an aorta was investigated. In particular, the relationship between the origin of cardiovascular disease and wall shear stress has been pointed out in the aorta region. Estimating the difference of the wall shear stress depend on the presence or absence of the twisted motion, the blood flow simulation was conducted. To express its complicated shape and the motion, the unstructured moving grid finite volume method was adopted. In this method, the control volume is defined for a space time unified domain. Not only a physical conservation law but also a geometric conservation law is satisfied in this approach.  Then high accurate computation is conducted under the method. From the computation results, a remarkable difference of complicated vortex structures generated in the left ventricle was found as the influence of the left ventricular twisted motion. The vortex structures affected the blood flow leading into the aorta with the result that they generated a clear difference of the wall shear stress. The region where the difference occurred is aortic arch, then it corresponded with a favorite site of arteriosclerosis. Thus, the result showed the possibility that the simulation with the left ventricular twisted motion would be useful to specify causes of heart diseases. }

As numerical models, two human body models with airways were prepared. These models are represented by unstructured grids. Having calculated the unsteady airflow in the room, we simulated the trajectory of droplets emitted by the human speaking. In addition, inhaling the droplets into the lung of the conversation partner was simulated. The number of the droplets adhered to the respiratory lining of the partner was counted separately on the nasal cavity, oral cavity, trachea, bronchi, and bronchial inlet surface. The diameters of the droplets were also investigated in the same manner. It was noticeable that more than 80% of the droplets inhaled by the conversation partner adhered to the bronchial inlet surface. Also, the conversation partner did not inhale droplets larger than 35 μm in diameter. It was found that when the distance between two people was 0.75 m, more droplets adhered to the partner’s torso.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising method that employs a distributed learning model structure to overcome data privacy and transmission issues paused by central machine learning models. In FL, datasets collected from different devices or sensors are used to train local models (clients) each of which shares its learning with a centralized model (server). However, this distributed learning approach presents unique learning challenges as the data used at local clients can be non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and statistically diverse which decrease learning accuracy in the central model. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing a novel personalized federated learning method based One-Class Support Vector Machine (FedP-OCSVM) to personalize the resulting support vectors at each client. Our experimental validation showed that our FedP-OCSVM precisely constructed generalized clients’ models and thus achieved higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Detecting and intercepting malicious requests are some of the most widely used ways against attacks in the network security, especially in the severe COVID-19 environment. Most existing detecting approaches, including matching blacklist characters and machine learning algorithms have all shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. To address the above issues, a more general and rigorous detection method is required. In this paper, we formulate the problem of detecting malicious requests as a temporal sequence classification problem, and propose a novel deep learning model namely GBLNet, girdling bidirectional LSTM with multi-granularity CNNs. By connecting the shadow and deep feature maps of the convolutional layers, the malicious feature extracting ability is improved on more detailed functionality. Experimental results on HTTP dataset CSIC 2010 demonstrate that GBLNet can efficiently detect intrusion traffic with superior accuracy and evaluating speed, compared with the state-of-the-arts.}

	abstract = {In the severe COVID-19 environment, encrypted mobile malware is increasingly threatening personal privacy, especially those targeting on Android platform. Existing methods mainly focus on extracting features from Android Malware (DroidMal) by reversing the binary samples, which is sensitive to the deduction of the available samples. Thus, they fail to tackle the insufficiency of the novel DoridMal. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate an effective solution to classify large-scale DroidMal, as well as to detect the novel one. We consider few-shot DroidMal detection as DoridMal encrypted network traffic classification and propose an image-based method with meta-learning, namely AMDetector, to address the issues. By capturing network traffic produced by DroidMal, samples are augmented and thus cater to the learning algorithms. Firstly, DroidMal encrypted traffic is converted to session images. Then, session images are embedded into a high dimension metric space, in which traffic samples can be linearly separated by computing the distance with the corresponding prototype. Large-scale and novel DroidMal traffic is classified by applying different meta-learning strategies. Experimental results on public datasets have demonstrated the capability of our method to classify large-scale known DroidMal traffic as well as to detect the novel one. It is encouraging to see that, our model achieves superior performance on known and novel DroidMal traffic classification among the state-of-the-arts. Moreover, AMDetector is able to classify the unseen cross-platform malware.}

	abstract = {Within the scope of the SeMap project, we have developed a web-based tool that aims to offer innovative dissemination of movable assets held in museums, linking them semantically and through interactive maps. SeMap is focused on depicting the objects that are catalogued in CER.ES, the Spanish Digital Network of Museum Collections, which offers a catalogue of 300,000+\u2009objects. To properly represent such objects in the SeMap tool, which considers their semantic relations, we needed to preprocess the data embedded in catalogues, and to design a knowledge graph based on CIDOC-CRM. To that end, the collaboration among academia, heritage curators and public authorities was of high relevance. This paper describes the steps taken to represent the CER.ES objects in the SeMap tool, focusing on the interdisciplinary collaboration. We also bring the results of a usability test, that proves the developed map is usable.}

	abstract = {Intelligent production requires maximum downtime avoidance since downtimes lead to economic loss. Thus, Industry 4.0 (today’s IoT-driven industrial revolution) is aimed at automated production with real-time decision-making and maximal uptime. To achieve this, new technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are integrated into production to optimize and automate many production processes. The increasing use of AGVs in production has far-reaching consequences for industrial communication systems. To make AGVs in production even more effective, we propose to use Federated Learning (FL) which provides a secure exchange of experience between intelligent manufacturing devices to improve prediction accuracy. We conducted research in which we exchanged experiences between the three virtual devices, and the results confirm the effectiveness of this approach in production environments.}

Such a model of cooperation is justified and especially purposeful in resolving various environment protection tasks, including the issues of energy transformation and climate change. The research regards air quality monitoring case study conducted in Ochotnica, South Poland. The environmental data have been collected, stored, and processed using a set of sensor stations as well as a data storing and processing service. The stations and the service are very flexible, easily extensible, and they have been successfully designed, implemented, and tested by the authors of this paper in the mentioned air quality monitoring case study. The collaboration in the conducted research has been an opportunity to create and test in practice a comprehensive, versatile and configurable data acquisition and processing system which supports not only this use case, but also can be applied to a wide variety of general data acquisition and data analysis purposes. In this paper we discuss the analysis of acquired environmental data as well as a general approach to environmental data processing and visualization system.}

	abstract = {Due to climate change, the hydrological drought is assuming a structural character with a tendency to worsen in many countries. The frequency and intensity of droughts is predicted to increase, particularly in the Mediterranean region and in Southern Africa. Since a fraction of the fresh water that is consumed is used to irrigate urban fabric green spaces, which are typically made up of gardens, lanes and roundabouts, it is urgent to implement water waste prevention policies. Evapotranspiration (ETO) is a measurement that can be used to estimate the amount of water being taken up or used by plants, allowing a better management of the watering volumes but, the exact computation of the evapotranspiration volume is not possible without using complex and expensive sensor systems. In this study, several machine learning models were developed to estimate reference evapotranspiration and solar radiation from a reduced-feature dataset, such has temperature, humidity, and wind. Two main approaches were taken: (i) directly estimate ETO, or (ii) previously estimate solar radiation and then inject it into a function or method that computes ETO. For the later case, two variants were implemented, namely the use of the estimated solar radiation as (ii.1) a feature of the machine learning regressors and (ii.2) the use of FAO-56PM method to compute ETO, which has solar radiation as one of the input parameters. Using experimental data collected from a weather station located in Vale do Lobo, south Portugal, the later approach achieved the best result with a coefficient of determination \\((R^2)\\) of 0.975 over the test dataset. As a final notice, the reduced-set features were carefully selected so that they are compatible with online freely available weather forecast services.}

	abstract = {In the past years, the number of users of web applications has increased, and also the number of critical vulnerabilities in these web applications. Web application security implies building websites to function as expected, even when they are under attack. SQL Injection is a web vulnerability caused by mistakes made by programmers, that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. In many cases, an attacker can see, modify or delete data without proper authorization. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in the source code, using nature-based algorithms: Genetic Algorithms (GA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). To test this approach empirically, we used web applications purposefully vulnerable as Bricks, bWAPP, and Twitterlike. We also perform comparisons with other tools from the literature. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Industrial IoT systems, such as those based on Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV), often generate a massive volume of data that needs to be processed and sent over to the cloud or private data centers. The presented research proposes and evaluates the approaches to data aggregation that help reduce the volume of readings from AGVs, by taking advantage of the edge computing paradigm. For the purposes of this article, we developed the processing workflow that retrieves data from AGVs, persists it in the local edge database, aggregates it in predefined time windows, and sends it to the cloud for further processing. We proposed two aggregation methods used in the considered workflow. We evaluated the developed workflow with different data sets and ran the experiments that allowed us to highlight the data volume reduction for each tested scenario. The results of the experiments show that solutions based on edge devices such as Jetson Xavier NX and technologies such as TimescaleDB can be successfully used to reduce the volume of data in pipelines that process data from Autonomous Guided Vehicles. Additionally, the use of edge computing paradigms improves the resilience to data loss in cases of network failures in such industrial systems.}

	abstract = {Extensive research on machine learning models, which in the majority are black-boxes, created a great need for the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods. Complex machine learning (ML) models usually require an external explanation method to understand their decisions. The interpretation of the model predictions are crucial in many fields, i.e., predictive maintenance, where it is not only required to evaluate the state of an asset, but also to determine the root causes of the potential failure. In this work, we present a comparison of state-of-the-art ML models and XAI methods, which we used for the prediction of the RUL of aircraft turbofan engines. We trained five different models on the C-MAPSS dataset and used SHAP and LIME to assign numerical importance to the features. We have compared the results of explanations using stability and consistency metrics and evaluated the explanations qualitatively by visual inspection. The obtained results indicate that SHAP method outperforms other methods in the fidelity of explanations. We observe that there exist substantial differences in the explanations depending on the selection of a model and XAI method, thus we find a need for further research in XAI field.}

	abstract = {Public transport systems are expected to reduce pollution and contribute to sustainable development. However, disruptions in public transport such as delays may negatively affect mobility choices. To quantify delays, aggregated data from vehicle location systems are frequently used. However, delays observed at individual stops are caused inter alia by fluctuations in running times and the knock-on effects of delays occurring in other locations. Hence, in this work, we propose both a method detecting significant delays and a reference architecture, relying on the stream processing engines in which the method is implemented. The method can complement the calculation of delays defined as deviation from schedules. This provides both online rather than batch identification of significant and repetitive delays, and resilience to the limited quality of location data. The method we propose can be used with different change detectors, such as ADWIN, applied to a location data stream shuffled to individual edges of a transport graph. It can detect in an online manner at which edges statistically significant delays are observed and at which edges delays arise and are reduced. Such detections can be used to model mobility choices and quantify the impact of regular rather than random disruptions on feasible trips with multimodal trip modelling engines. The evaluation performed with the public transport data of over 2000 vehicles confirms the merits of the method and reveals that a limited-size subgraph of a transport system graph causes statistically significant delays.}

	abstract = {Scientific software often involves many input and output variables. Identifying these variables is important for such software engineering tasks as metamorphic testing. To reduce the manual work, we report in this paper our investigation of machine learning algorithms in classifying variables from software’s user manuals. We identify thirteen natural-language features, and use them to develop a multi-layer solution where the first layer distinguishes variables from non-variables and the second layer classifies the variables into input and output types. Our experimental results on three scientific software systems show that random forest and feedforward neural network can be used to best implement the first layer and second layer respectively.}

	abstract = {Parallel computing is currently the only possible method for providing sufficient performance of large scale urban traffic simulations. The need for representing large areas with detailed, continuous space and motion models exceeds the capabilities of a single computer in terms of performance and memory capacity. Efficient distribution of such computation, which is considered in this paper, poses a challenge due to the need of repetitive synchronization of the common simulation model. We propose an architecture for efficient memory and communication management, which allows executing simulations of huge urban areas and efficient utilization of hundreds of computing nodes. In addition to analyzing performance tests, we also provide general guidelines for designing large-scale distributed simulations.}

	abstract = {Research software is often developed by individual researchers or small teams in parallel to their research work. The more people and research projects rely on the software in question, the more important it is that software updates implement new features correctly and do not introduce regressions. Thus, developers of research software must balance their limited resources between implementing new features and thoroughly testing any code changes. We present the processes we use for developing the distributed integration framework RCE at DLR. These processes aim to strike a balance between automation and manual testing, reducing the testing overhead while addressing issues as early as possible. We furthermore briefly describe how these testing processes integrate with the surrounding processes for development and releasing.}

	abstract = {To improve the productivity of research software developers we need to first understand their development practices. Previous studies on this topic have collected data by surveying as many developers as possible, across a broad range of application domains. We propose to dig deeper into the state of the practice by instead looking at what developers in specific domains create, as evidenced by the contents of their repositories. Our methodology prescribes the following steps: i) Identify the domain; ii) Identify a list of candidate software; iii) Filter the list to a length of about 30 packages; iv) Collect repository related data on each package, like number of stars, number of open issues, number of lines of code; v) Fill in the measurement template (the template consists of 108 questions to assess 9 qualities (including the qualities of installability, usability and visibility)); vi) Rank the software using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); vii) Interview developers (the interview consists of 20 questions and takes about an hour); and, viii) Conduct a domain analysis. The collected data is analyzed by: i) comparing the ranking by best practices against the ranking by popularity; ii) comparing artifacts, tools and processes to current research software development guidelines; and, iii) exploring pain points. We estimate the time to complete an assessment at 173 person hours. The method is illustrated via the example of Lattice Boltzmann Solvers, where we find that the top packages engaged in most of recommended best practices, but still show room for improvement with respect to providing API documentation, a roadmap, a code of conduct, programming style guide and continuous integration.}

	abstract = {In the search for a sustainable approach for software ecosystems that supports experimental and observational science (EOS) across Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we conducted a survey to understand the current and future landscape of EOS software and data. This paper describes the survey design we used to identify significant areas of interest, gaps, and potential opportunities, followed by a discussion on the obtained responses. The survey formulates questions about project demographics, technical approach, and skills required for the present and the next five years. The study was conducted among 38 ORNL participants between June and July of 2021 and followed the required guidelines for human subjects training. We plan to use the collected information to help guide a vision for sustainable, community-based, and reusable scientific software ecosystems that need to adapt effectively to: i) the evolving landscape of heterogeneous hardware in the next generation of instruments and computing (e.g. edge, distributed, accelerators), and ii) data management requirements for data-driven science using artificial intelligence.}

	abstract = {Optimal control of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a challenging topic. In this contribution, we consider a new control problem of an infinite-dimensional jump-driven SDE with long (sub-exponential) memory arising in river hydrology. We deal with the case where the dynamics follow a superposition of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes having distributed reversion speeds (called supOU process in short) as found in real problems. Our stochastic control problem is of an ergodic type to minimize a long-run linear-quadratic objective. We show that solving the control problem reduces to finding a solution to an integro-Riccati equation and that the optimal control is infinite-dimensional as well. The integro-Riccati equation is numerically computed by discretizing the phase space of the reversion speed. We use the supOU process with an actual data of river discharge in a mountainous river environment. Computational performance of the proposed numerical scheme is examined against different discretization parameters. The convergence of the scheme is then verified with a manufactured solution. Our paper thus serves as new modeling, computation, and application of an infinite-dimensional SDE.}

	abstract = {In this paper, interval modification of degenerate parametric integral equation system (DPIES) for Laplace’s equation was presented. The main purpose of such a modification was to reduce the computational time necessary to solve uncertainly defined boundary problems. Such problems were modeled with the uncertainly defined shape of the boundary using proposed modified directed interval arithmetic. The presented algorithm of mentioned interval modification of DPIES was implemented as a computer program. The reliability and efficiency tests were proceeded based on boundary problems modeled by Laplace’s equation. Both, obtained solutions, as well as computational time, were analyzed. As a result, the interval kernels interpolation (using Lagrange polynomial) caused a reduction of necessary interval arithmetic calculations, which also caused accelerations of computations.}

	abstract = {Based on a survey (with 350 respondents), the occurrence of uncertainty, defined as incomplete or imperfect knowledge in the project planning or preparation stage, was described and quantified. The uncertainty with respect to customer expectations, project result, methods to be used, duration and cost of project stages, and (both human and material) resources was considered, and its consequences for project management and entire organizations were analysed. The results show that the scope of uncertainty in projects cannot be neglected in practice and requires the use, in the project planning or preparation stage, and during the whole project course, of advanced project and uncertainty management methods. The questionnaire used in the document is recommended to be applied to organizations in order to measure and track the scope of uncertainty in the projects being implemented and adopt a tailored approach to uncertainty management. Agile approaches seem to be highly recommendable in this regard. Future research directions are proposed, including the application of a special type of fuzzy numbers to project management.}

	abstract = {Knowledge Graphs are extensively adopted in a variety of disciplines to support knowledge integration, visualization, unification, analysis and sharing at different levels. On the other side, Ontology has gained a significant popularity within machine-processable environments, where it is extensively used to formally define knowledge structures. Additionally, the progressive development of the Semantic Web has further contributed to a consolidation at a conceptual level and to the consequent standardisation of languages as part of the Web technology. This work focuses on customizable visualization/interaction, looking at Knowledge Graphs resulting from formal ontologies. While the proposed approach in itself is considered to be scalable via customization, the current implementation of the research prototype assumes detailed visualizations for relatively small data sets with a progressive detail decreasing when the amount of information increases. Finally, issues related to possible misinterpretations of ontology-based knowledge graphs from a final user perspective are briefly discussed.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm to evaluate and mitigate the uncertainty of data reported by eye gaze tracking devices embedded in virtual reality head-mounted displays. Our algorithm first is calibrated by leveraging unit quaternions to encode angular differences between reported and ground-truth gaze directions, then interpolates these quaternions for each gaze sample, and finally corrects gaze directions by rotating them using interpolated quaternions. The real part of the interpolated quaternion is used as the certainty factor for the corresponding gaze direction sample. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the VRSciVi Workbench within the ontology-driven SciVi visual analytics platform and can be used to improve the eye gaze tracking quality in different virtual reality applications including the ones for Digital Humanities research. The tests of the proposed algorithm revealed its capability of increasing eye tracking accuracy by 25% and precision by 32% compared with the raw output of the Tobii tracker embedded in the Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display. In addition, the certainty factors calculated help to acknowledge the quality of reported gaze directions in the subsequent data analysis stages. Due to the ontology-driven software generation, the proposed approach enables high-level adaptation to the specifics of the experiments in virtual reality.}

	abstract = {When used in simulations, the quasi-Monte Carlo methods utilize specially constructed sequences in order to improve on the respective Monte Carlo methods in terms of accuracy mainly. Their advantage comes from the possibility to devise sequences of numbers that are better distributed in the corresponding high-dimensional unit cube, compared to the randomly sampled points of the typical Monte Carlo method. Perhaps the most widely used family of sequences are the Sobol’ sequences, due to their excellent equidistribution properties. These sequences are determined by sets of so-called direction numbers, where researches have significant freedom to tailor the set being used to the problem at hand. The advancements in scientific computing lead to ever increasing dimensionality of the problems under consideration. Due to the increased computational cost of the simulations, the number of trajectories that can be used is limited. In this work we concentrate on optimising the direction numbers of the Sobol’ sequences in such situations, when the constructive dimension of the algorithm is relatively high, compared to the number of points of the sequence being used. We propose an algorithm that provides us with such sets of numbers, suitable for a range of problems. We then show how the resulting sequences perform in numerical experiments, compared with other well known sets of direction numbers. The algorithm has been efficiently implemented on servers equipped with powerful GPUs and is applicable for a wide range of problems.}

	abstract = {\nThe continuous growth in data collection requires effective and efficient capabilities to support Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) over large amounts of complex data. However, as activities such as data acquisition, cleaning, preparation, and recording may lead to incompleteness, impairing the KDD processes, specially because most analysis methods do not adequately handle missing data. To analyze complex data, such as performing similarity search or classification tasks, KDD processes require similarity assessment. However, incompleteness can disrupt the assessment evaluation, making the system unable to compare incomplete tuples. Therefore, incompleteness can render databases useless for knowledge extraction or, at best, dramatically reducing their usefulness. In this paper, we propose MiDaS, a framework based on a RDBMS system that offers tools to deal with missing data employing several strategies, making it possible to assess similarity over complex data, even in the presence of missing data at KDD scenarios. We show experimental results of analyses using MiDaS for similarity retrieval, classification, and clustering tasks over publicly available complex datasets, evaluating the quality and performance of several missing data treatments. The results highlight that MiDaS is well-suited for dealing with incompleteness enhancing data analysis in several KDD scenarios.}

	abstract = {For over fifty years we have worked to improve the teaching of computer science and coding. Teaching computational science extends on these challenges as students may be less inclined towards coding given they have chosen a different discipline which may have only recently become computational. Introductory coding education could be considered a checklist of skills, however that does not prepare students for tackling innovative projects. To apply coding to a domain, students need to take their skills and venture into the unknown, persevering through various levels of errors and misunderstanding. In this paper we reflect on programming assignments in Curtin Computing’s Fundamentals of Programming unit. In the recent Summer School, students were challenged to simulate the generation and movement of snowflakes, experiencing frustration and elation as they achieved varying levels of success in the assignment. Although these assignments are resource-intensive in design, student effort and assessment, we see them as the most effective way to prepare students for future computational science projects.}

	abstract = {The purpose of the presented work was to foster the reuse of whole remote classes, including the workflows involving multiple tools used during the class. Such a functionality is especially useful for designing new classes and introducing new topics into curricula, which happens quite often in laboratory-based courses in the Information Technologies area. The proposed approach allows professors to shorten the time it takes to create remote collaboration environments designed and prepared by their peers, by integrating multiple tools in topic-oriented educational collaboration environments. To achieve that, we split the system, code-named ‘sozisel’, into two parts - one of them responsible for facilitating creation of educational environments templates (models) describing the online class workflows composed of multiple tools, the other being responsible for executing the actual classes. For the environment to be extensible, we decided to use open, standards-based technologies only. This stands in contrast with most of commercially available environments, which are frequently based on proprietary technologies. The functional evaluation carried out on the sozisel prototype proved that the system does not require significant resources to be used in classes of medium size.}

	abstract = {This paper presents an intuitive Python toolbox for Teaching Ensemble-based Data Assimilation (DA), TEDA. This toolbox responds to the necessity of having software for teaching and learning topics related to ensemble-based DA; this process can be critical to motivate undergraduate and graduate students towards scientific topics such as meteorological anomalies and climate change. Most DA toolboxes are related to operational software wherein the learning process of concepts and methods is not the main focus. TEDA facilitates the teaching and learning process of DA concepts via multiple plots of error statistics and by providing different perspectives of numerical results such as model errors, observational errors, error distributions, the time evolution of errors, ensemble-based DA, covariance matrix inflation, precision matrix estimation, and covariance localization methods, among others. By default, the toolbox is released with five well-known ensemble-based DA methods: the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the dual EnKF formulation, the EnKF via Cholesky decomposition, the EnKF based on a modified Cholesky decomposition, and the EnKF based on B-localization. Besides, TEDA comes with three toy models: the Duffing equation (2 variables), the Lorenz 63 model (3 variables), and the Lorenz 96 model (40 variables), all of which exhibit chaotic behavior for some parameter configurations, which makes them attractive for testing DA methods. We develop the toolbox using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which makes incorporating new techniques and models into the toolbox easy. We can simulate several DA scenarios for different configurations of models and methods to better understand how ensemble-based DA methods work.}

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are still responsible for many deaths worldwide, and computational models are essential tools for a better understanding of the behavior of cardiac tissue under normal and pathological situations. The microstructure of cardiac tissue is complex and formed by the preferential alignment of myocytes along their main axis with end-to-end coupling. Mathematical models of cardiac mechanics require the process of parameter estimation to produce a response consistent with experimental data and the physiological phenomenon in question. This work presents a polynomial chaos-based emulator for forward uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the Holzapfel-Ogden orthotropic constitutive model during the passive filling stage. The fiber orientation field is treated as a random field through the usage of the Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion. The response and uncertainty of the constitutive parameters of the model considered here are also investigated. Our results show the propagated uncertainties for the end-diastolic volume and fiber strain. A global sensitivity analysis of the constitutive parameters of the complete model is also presented, evidencing the model’s key parameters.\n}

This tool can facilitate quantitative assessments of the model’s overall uncertainty for a given specific range of variables. The computational approach here is based on the polynomial chaos expansion using projection variance, a pseudo-spectral method. It also supports regression variance, a point collocation method with nested quadrature point where the random sampling method takes a dictionary of the names of the parameters which are manually defined to vary with corresponding distributions. The tool in conjunction with an existing platform for verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification offers a scientific simulation environment and data processing workflows that enables the execution of simulation and analysis tasks on a cluster or supercomputing platform with remote submission capabilities.}
