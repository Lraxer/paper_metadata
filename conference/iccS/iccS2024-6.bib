	abstract = {In recent years, unsupervised and self-supervised graph representation learning has gained popularity in the research community. However, most proposed methods are focused on homogeneous networks, whereas real-world graphs often contain multiple node and edge types. Multiplex graphs, a special type of heterogeneous graphs, possess richer information, provide better modeling capabilities and integrate more detailed data from potentially different sources. The diverse edge types in multiplex graphs provide more context and insights into the underlying processes of representation learning. In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning representations for nodes in multiplex networks in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner. To that end, we explore diverse information fusion schemes performed at different levels of the graph processing pipeline. The detailed analysis and experimental evaluation of various scenarios inspired us to propose improvements in how to construct GNN architectures that deal with multiplex graphs.\n}

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a major public health problem, with 2.3M new cases diagnosed each year. Immunotherapy is an effective treatment for breast cancer depending on several factors like subtype of tumours or associated prognosis. However, the immune system’s efficiency depends on the local microenvironment and requires region-specific trials with a reduced number of samples. To minimise this drawback and improve the accuracy of patient prognosis predictions, we explore several data augmentation methods, i.e. noise injection, oversampling techniques and generative adversarial networks. The experiment was conducted through a set of immune system gene expression samples donated by 165 breast cancer patients from the Málaga region. Results showed a \\(5\\%\\) increase in AUC and a 23-\\(36\\%\\) increase in F\\(_1\\) score for subtype prediction.}

	abstract = {Accurate and robust assessment of non-traditional approach-es used for training students and professionals in improving laparoscopic surgical skills has been attracting many research studies recently. Such assessment is particularly critical with the recent advances related to virtual environments and AI tools in addressing the need to expand the education and training in the medical domains. Network models and population analysis methods have been identified as excellent approaches in providing the much-needed assessment. This study aims at further advancing the surgical skill assessment by introducing a comparative approach to threshold optimization in analyzing the network models. While the majority of network methods often on arbitrary or hard thresholds for network construction and analysis, this research explores the efficacy of network-based parameters for identifying key elements and clusters in extracting useful information from the constructed networks. We report the positive impact of using network structural parameters, such as edge betweenness and modularity, to conduct robust analysis of the assessment networks. In this work, we employ electromyography (EMG) data and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) scores for comprehensive skill evaluation. We present a case study that highlights the advantage of selecting thresholds based on the highest edge betweenness associated with the obtained assessment networks. This proposed approach method proved to be more effective in identifying participants who exhibit significant learning progression, aligning their muscle activation patterns closely with top performers. We demonstrate that optimizing thresholds through edge betweenness offers a more accurate visualization and assessment of skill acquisition in laparoscopic surgery training.\n}

	abstract = {Graph embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing complex network structures in a low-dimensional space, enabling efficient methods that employ the metric structure in the embedding space as a proxy for the topological structure of the data. In this paper, we explore several aspects that affect the quality of a vertex embedding of graph-structured data. To this effect, we first present a family of flexible distance functions that faithfully capture the topological distance between different vertices. Secondly, we analyze vertex embeddings as resulting from a\xa0fitted transformation of the distance matrix rather than as a\xa0direct result of optimization. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding constructions by performing community detection on a host of benchmark datasets. The reported results are competitive with classical algorithms that operate on the entire graph while benefiting from a substantially reduced computational complexity due to the reduced dimensionality of the representations.\n\n}

	abstract = {Recent rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible for researchers to explore the microbial universe in high degrees of depth that were not possible even few years ago. Microbial communities occupy numerous environments everywhere and significantly impact the health of the living organisms in their environments. With the availability of microbiome data, advanced computational tools are critical to conduct the needed analysis and allow researchers to extract meaningful knowledge leading to actionable decisions. However, despite many attempts to develop tools to analyze the heterogeneous datasets associated with various microbiomes, such attempts lack the sophistication and robustness needed to efficiently analyze these complex heterogeneous datasets and produce accurate results. In addition, almost all current methods employ heuristic concepts that do not guarantee the robustness and reproducibility needed to provide the biomedical community with trusted analysis that lead to precise data-driven decisions. In this study, we present a network model that attempts to overcome these challenges by utilizing graph-theoretic concepts and employing multiple computational methods with the goal of conducting robust analysis and produce accurate results. To test the proposed model, we performed the analysis on plant microbiome datasets to obtain distinctive functional modules based on key microbial interrelationships in a given host environment. Our findings establish a framework for a new understanding of the association between functional modules based on microbial community structure.\n}

	abstract = {In this study, we employed a clustering approach to analyze fMRI data from a publicly available dataset of patients with mild depression. We utilized the CONN toolbox, a widely recognized tool, to extract functional networks from the fMRI data. Subsequently, these networks were aligned using MULTIMAGNA++, a global multiple alignment software, to ensure consistency across individual datasets. The aligned data was then subjected to a clustering analysis to investigate the presence of distinct patterns. Our findings demonstrate that not only is it feasible to accurately cluster patients using this approach, but there is also potential to uncover previously unidentified subgroups among both control subjects and those affected by the disease. These results suggest new avenues for understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of mild depression and for developing targeted interventions.\n}

	abstract = {The formalism of multilayer networks (MLN) makes possible to model and understand the multiple relationships between entities in a system. Indeed, this representation has found its way into a wide range of disciplines, particularly in the fields of neuroscience and neuroimaging. Human brain modelling made possible the identification of the basis for the construction of morphological, structural and functional brain connectivity networks. In this work, we propose the design and implementation of a software pipeline for the construction and analysis of multilayer brain networks. This approach aims to identify groups of strongly connected nodes within the network and to evaluate the resulting communities. We examined 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients with multiple sclerosis. We analyzed the brain MLN by applying community detection algorithm that identified recurrent communities in patients with multiple sclerosis. To assess the structure of communities within the network, we calculate modularity indices for each subject. Finally, we confirm what has already been found in the literature, i.e. a high modularity in the brain networks of diseased subjects compared to those of healthy subjects. Future developments could involve aligning these networks to identify common patterns among multiple sclerosis patients and potentially identify subgroups of patients with similar neural characteristics.}

The CORDIC algorithm is an iterative method for computing trigonometric functions and rotating vectors without using complex calculations. The authors propose two modifications for improving the classical CORDIC algorithm: completing iterations with one-directional rotation of the vector at the final stages and choosing a scaling factor value that can be implemented with low-cost dedicated hardware utilising canonical signed digits representation. The modified algorithm is implemented in a pipeline approach using Verilog language in an Altera Cyclone V System-on-Chip FPGA. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy and lower latency than the classic CORDIC algorithm.}

With the increasing popularity, questions about the best representations of hyperbolic spaces arise, as each representation comes with some numerical instability. This paper compares various 2D and 3D hyperbolic geometry representations. To this end, we conduct an extensive simulational scheme based on six tests of numerical precision errors. Our comparisons include the most popular models and less-known mixed and reduced representations. According to our results, polar representation wins, although the halfplane invariant is also very successful. We complete the comparison with a brief discussion of the non-numerical advantages of various representations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider implementations of the sigmoid activation function for artificial neural network hardware systems. A rational fraction number system is proposed to calculate this function. This form of data representation offers several benefits, including increased precision compared to integers and more straightforward implementation in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) than the floating-point number system. In contemporary FPGA applications, rational fractions excel in regard to their compact hardware size, high throughput, and the ability to adjust the precision through the selection of the data width. The proposed module for calculation of the sigmoid activation function is shown to have high throughput and to occupy a relatively modest hardware volume compared to modules relying on piecewise polynomial approximation with fixed-point data.}

	abstract = {Turbulent flows play important roles in many flow-related phenomena that appear in various fields. However, despite numerous studies on turbulence, the nature of turbulence has not yet been fully clarified. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of incompressible homogeneous turbulence in a periodic box is currently a powerful method for studying turbulent flows. However, even modern world-class supercomputers do not have sufficient computational resources to carry out DNS at very high Reynolds number (Re). Memory capacity constraints are particularly severe. Therefore, we have developed an out-of-core DNS (ooc-DNS) code that uses storage to overcome memory limitations. The ooc-DNS code can reduce memory usage by up to a quarter and allows DNS at a higher Re, which would be impossible under normal usage due to memory limitations. When implementing the ooc-DNS code, however, it is crucial to accelerate file input/output (I/O) because the I/O time for storage accounts for a large percentage of the execution time. In this paper, we evaluate the I/O performance of the ooc-DNS code when using a file system called the Lightweight Layered I/O Accelerator of the supercomputer Fugaku. We also evaluate the impact of the I/O cache and its size on I/O performance and show that the I/O processing can be accelerated by using the cache and optimizing its size. Finally, by taking on I/O cache size when executing the ooc-DNS code with \\(8,192^3\\) grid points, the I/O speed and overall execution speed are increased by 2.4 times and 1.9 times compared to that without the I/O cache.}

	abstract = {Single-layer shallow water models have been widely used for simulating shallow water waves over both fixed and movable beds. However, these models can not capture some hydraulic features such as small eddy currents and flow recirculations. This study presents a novel numerical approach for coupling multi-layer shallow water models with elastic deformations to accurately capture complex recirculation patterns in wind-driven flows. This class of multi-layer equations avoids the computationally demanding methods needed to solve the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for free-surface flows while it provides stratified flow velocities since the pressure distribution is still assumed to be hydrostatic. In the current study, the free-surface flow problem is approximated as a layered system made of multiple shallow water equations of different water heights but coupled through mass-exchange terms between the embedded layers. Deformations in the topography are accounted for using linear elastostatic systems for which an internal force is applied. Transfer conditions at the interface between the water surface and the topography are also developed using frictional forces and hydrostatic pressures. For the computational solver, we implement a fast and accurate hybrid finite element/finite volume method solving the linear deformations on unstructured meshes and the nonlinear flows using well-balanced discretizations. Numerical results are presented for various problems and the computed solutions demonstrate the ability of the proposed model in accurately resolving wind-driven flows over deformable topography.}

	abstract = {CFD has emerged as an indispensable tool for comprehending and refining fluid flow phenomena within engineering domains. The recent integration of CFD with AI has unveiled novel avenues for expedited simulations and computing precision. This research paper delves into the accuracy of amalgamating CFD with AI and assesses its performance across modern server-class Intel CPU/GPU architectures such as the 4th generation of Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs (codename Sapphire Rapids) and Intel Data Center Max GPUs (or Ponte Vecchio). Our investigation focuses on exploring the potential of mixed-precision techniques with diverse number formats, namely, FP32, FP16, and BF16, to accelerate CFD computations through AI-based methods. Particular emphasis is given to validating outcomes to ensure their applicability across a CFD motorBike simulation. This research explores the performance/accuracy trade-off for both AI training and simulations, including OpenFOAM solver and interference with the trained model, across various data types available on Intel CPUs/GPUs. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of how different number formats impact the performance and accuracy of the DNN-based model in various application scenarios running on modern HPC architectures.}

	abstract = {The quantum volume is a comprehensive, single number metric to describe the computational power of a quantum computer. It has grown exponentially in the recent past. In this study we will assume this remains the case and translate this development into the performance development of another quantum algorithms, quantum amplitude estimation. This is done using a noise model that estimates the error probability of a single run of an algorithm. Its parameters are related to the quantum volume under the model’s assumptions. Applying the same noise model to quantum amplitude estimation, it is possible to relate the error rate to the generated Fisher information per second, which is the main performance metric of quantum amplitude estimation as a numerical integration technique. This provides a prediction of its integration capabilities and shows that quantum amplitude estimation as a numerical integration technique will not provide an advantage over classical alternatives in the near future without major breakthroughs.}

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms, represented as quantum circuits, can be used as benchmarks for assessing the performance of quantum systems. Existing datasets, widely utilized in the field, suffer from limitations in size and versatility, leading researchers to employ randomly generated circuits. Random circuits are, however, not representative benchmarks as they lack the inherent properties of real quantum algorithms for which the quantum systems are manufactured. This shortage of ‘useful’ quantum benchmarks poses a challenge to advancing the development and comparison of quantum compilers and hardware. This research aims to enhance the existing quantum circuit datasets by generating what we refer to as ‘realistic-looking’ circuits by employing the Transformer machine learning architecture. For this purpose, we introduce KetGPT, a tool that generates synthetic circuits in OpenQASM language, whose structure is based on quantum circuits derived from existing quantum algorithms and follows the typical patterns of human-written algorithm-based code (e.g., order of gates and qubits). Our three-fold verification process, involving manual inspection and Qiskit framework execution, transformer-based classification, and structural analysis, demonstrates the efficacy of KetGPT in producing large amounts of additional circuits that closely align with algorithm-based structures. Beyond benchmarking, we envision KetGPT contributing substantially to AI-driven quantum compilers and systems.}

Every quantum circuit can be represented using algebraic expressions, we propose an approach that directly derives algebraic expressions, ensuring that parallelism is maximized, that is, the number of circuit slices is minimized, and secondly, the computation required for obtaining the desired algebraic expression is reduced. This results in quantum circuits that are more efficient in space and computation time. The simplification of algebraic expressions offers methods to streamline optimized circuits, reducing the number of gates and depth. This reduction is aimed at minimizing the overall complexity of the expressions, resulting in more efficient quantum computations.

This is a generalization of the well-known Boolean Satisfiability Problem (also known as the SAT problem), the first problem that was proven to be NP-complete. With the proliferation of quantum computing, a current approach to tackle this optimization problem is Quantum Annealing (QA). In this work, we compare several gadgets that translate 3-SAT problems into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems to be able to solve them in a quantum annealer. We show the performance superiority of the not-yet-considered gadgets in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when solving random instances in D-Wave’s quantum annealer.}

	abstract = {Quantum annealers (QA), such as D-Wave systems, become increasingly efficient and competitive at approximating combinatorial optimization problems. However, solving problems that do not directly map the chip topology remains challenging for this type of quantum computer. The creation of logical qubits as sets of interconnected physical qubits overcomes limitations imposed by the sparsity of the chip at the expense of increasing the problem size and adding new parameters to optimize. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks provided by the structure of the logical qubits and the impact of the rescaling of coupler strengths on the minimum spectral gap of Ising models. We show that logical qubits encoded over densely connected physical qubits require a lower chain strength to maintain the ferromagnetic coupling. We also analyze the optimal chain strength variations considering different minor embeddings of the same instance. This experimental study suggests that the chain strength can be optimized for each instance. We design a heuristic that optimizes the chain strength using a very low number of shots during the preprocessing step. This heuristic outperforms the default method used to initialize the chain strength on D-Wave systems, increasing the quality of the best solution by up to \\(17.2\\%\\) for tested instances on the max-cut problem.}

	abstract = {Tactical deconfliction problem involves resolving conflicts between aircraft to ensure safety while maintaining efficient trajectories. Several techniques exist to safely adjust aircraft parameters such as speed, heading angle, or flight level, with many relying on mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming. These techniques, however, often encounter challenges in real-world applications due to computational complexity and scalability issues. This paper proposes a new quantum approach that applies the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOAnsatz) to address the aircraft deconfliction problem. We present a formula for designing quantum Hamiltonians capable of handling a broad range of discretized maneuvers, with the aim of minimizing changes to original flight schedules while safely resolving conflicts. Our experiments show that a higher number of aircraft poses fewer challenges than a larger number of maneuvers. Additionally, we benchmark the newest IBM quantum processor and show that it successfully solves four out of five instances considered. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating hard constraints into the mixer Hamiltonian makes QAOAnsatz superior to QAOA. These findings suggest quantum algorithms could be a valuable algorithmic candidate for addressing complex optimization problems in various domains, with implications for enhancing operational efficiency and safety in aviation and other sectors.\n}

	abstract = {Inspired by Lyapunov control techniques for quantum systems, feedback-based quantum algorithms have recently been proposed as alternatives to variational quantum algorithms for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. These algorithms update the circuit parameters layer-wise through feedback from measuring the qubits in the previous layer to estimate expectations of certain observables. Therefore, the number of samples directly affects the algorithm’s performance and may even cause divergence. In this work, we propose an adaptive technique to mitigate the sampling noise by adopting a switching control law in the design of the feedback-based algorithm. The proposed technique can lead to better performance and convergence properties. We show the robustness of our technique against sampling noise through an application for the maximum clique problem.}

	abstract = {While the majority of focus in quantum computing has so far been on monolithic quantum systems, quantum communication networks and the quantum internet in particular are increasingly receiving attention from researchers and industry alike. The quantum internet may allow a plethora of applications such as distributed or blind quantum computing, though research still is at an early stage, both for its physical implementation as well as algorithms; thus suitable applications are an open research question. We evaluate a potential application for the quantum internet, namely quantum federated learning. We run experiments under different settings in various scenarios (e.g. network constraints) using several datasets from different domains and show that (1) quantum federated learning is a valid alternative for regular training and (2) network topology and nature of training are crucial considerations as they may drastically influence the models performance. The results indicate that more comprehensive research is required to optimally deploy quantum federated learning on a potential quantum internet.}

However, computationally expensive methods like exact probabilistic model checking do not scale with the size of the quantum network. In this work, we analyse entanglement swapping, an important primitive in quantum networks, using statistical model checking. We investigate the robustness of entanglement swapping against important parameters like longevity of quantum memory, success probability of entanglement generation and Bell State Measurements, and heterogeneity of the quantum network nodes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach using the MultiVeStA statistical model checker and the SeQUeNCe quantum network simulator.}

	abstract = {Connecting quantum computers to a quantum network opens a wide array of new applications, such as securely performing computations on distributed data sets. Near-term quantum networks are noisy, however, and hence correctness and security of protocols are not guaranteed. To study the impact of noise, we consider a multiparty summation protocol with imperfect shared entangled states. We study analytically the impact of both depolarising and dephasing noise on this protocol and the noise patterns arising in the probability distributions. We conclude by eliminating the need for a trusted third party in the protocol using Shamir’s secret sharing.}

	abstract = {Application of post-quantum algorithms in newly deployed cryptosystems is necessary nowadays. In the NIST Post-Quantum Competition several algorithms that seem to be resistant against attacks mounted using quantum computers have been chosen as finalists. However, it is worth noting that one of finalists—SIKE—was catastrophically broken by a classical attack of Castryck and Decru only a month after qualifying for the final round. This shows that absolute trust cannot yet be placed in the algorithms being standardized. And so a proposition was made to use the novel, post-quantum schemes alongside the well-studied classical ones with parameters chosen appropriately to remain secure against quantum attacks at least temporarily, i.e., until a large enough quantum computer is built. This paper analyzes which classical public-key algorithms should be used in tandem with the post-quantum instances, and studies how to ensure appropriate levels of both classical and quantum security. Projections about the development of quantum computers are reviewed in the context of selecting the parameters of the classical schemes such as to provide quantum resistance for a specified amount of time.}

	abstract = {Due to Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, quantum computing has become one of the fastest-evolving areas in computational science. Nowadays, one of the most interesting branches of quantum computing is quantum annealing. This paper presents the efficient method of transforming stream cipher E0 to the QUBO problem and then retrieving the Encryption Key of this cipher using quantum annealing. Comparably to other asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic algorithms, the presented transformation is efficient, requiring only 2,728 (2,751) logical variables for attack with 128 (129) consecutive keystream bits. According to our knowledge, it is the most efficient algorithm transformation with a 128-bit key. Moreover, we show that using current quantum annealers, one can embed the attack for E0 for 58 consecutive bits of keystream, from 128 (129), which are necessary for the attack’s first stage (second stage). Therefore, it is likely that it will be possible to embed E0 on available quantum annealers in the next few years.}
