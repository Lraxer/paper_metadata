	abstract = {We present a novel method to identify and locate weather fronts at various pressure levels to create a three dimensional structure using weather data located at the North Atlantic. It provides statistical evaluations regarding the slope and weather phenomena correlated to the identified three dimensional structure. Our approach is based on a deep neural network to locate 2D surface fronts first, which are then used as an initialization to extend them to various height levels. We show that our method is able to detect frontal locations between 500\xa0hPa and 1000\xa0hPa.}

	abstract = {The Digital Twin paradigm in medical care has recently gained popularity among proponents of translational medicine, to enable clinicians to make informed choices regarding treatment on the basis of digital simulations. In this paper we present an overview of functional and non-functional requirements related to specific IT solutions which enable such simulations - including the need to ensure repeatability and traceability of results - and propose an architecture that satisfies these requirements. We then describe a computational platform that facilitates digital twin simulations, and validate our approach in the context of a real-life medical use case: the BoneStrength application.}

	abstract = {Currently, manned drones, also known as flying cars, are attracting attention, but due to legal restrictions and fear of accidents, it is difficult to fly them. We therefore present a numerical simulation of the sudden stop of the rotor of an octrotor flying car. In this paper, we consider the interaction between fluid and rigid-body in a 6-degrees of freedom flight simulation of a flying car. For the purpose, the attitude of the aircraft is determined based on the force generated from the flow field around the aircraft due to the rotation of the rotor. The motion of the aircraft is obtained from the equations of motion of translation and rotation, and Newton's equation of motion and Euler's equation of rotation are used. A multi-axis sliding mesh is adopted for the rotation of the rotor, and calculations with multiple rotating bodies in the computational grid are performed. In addition, we use the motion computational domain (MCD) method to represent the free motion of the octrotor flying car by the motion computational domain itself. Using the above method, we will show the appropriate rotation method from various rotor stop patterns, demonstrate the safety of the octrotor flying car, and clarify the behavior of the aircraft and the surrounding flow field.}

From the experiments presented, we can deduce that the method is well suited for solving block banded or more generally localized systems in a parallel computing environment. The parallel implementation has been benchmarked using several Markovian models.}

	abstract = {Every year, forest fires burn thousands of hectares of forest around the world and cause significant damage to the economy and people from the affected zone. For that reason, computational fire spread models arise as useful tools to minimize the impact of wildfires. It is well known that part of the forest fire forecast error comes from the uncertainty in the input data required by the models. Different strategies have been developed to reduce the impact of this input-data uncertainty during the last few years. One of these strategies consists of introducing a data-driven calibration stage where the input parameters are adjusted according to the actual evolution of the fire using an evolutionary scheme. In particular, the approach described in this work consists of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). This calibration strategy is computationally intensive and time-consuming. In the case of natural hazards, it is necessary to maintain a balance between accuracy and time needed to calibrate the input parameters. Most scientific codes have over-engineered the numerical precision required to obtain reliable results. In this paper, we propose to use a mixed-precision methodology to accelerate the calibration of the input parameters involved in forest fire spread prediction without sacrificing the accuracy of the forecast. The proposed scheme has been tested on a real fire. The results have led us to conclude that using the mixed-precision approach does not compromise the quality of the result provided by the forest fire spread simulator and can also speed up the whole evolutionary prediction system.}

	abstract = {Today, android dominates the smartphone operating systems market. As per Google, there are over 3 billion active android users. With such a large population depending on the platform for their daily activities, a strong need exists to protect android from adversaries. Historically, techniques like signature and behavior were used in malware detectors. However, machine learning and deep learning models have now started becoming a core part of next-generation android malware detectors. In this paper, we step into malware developers/adversary shoes and ask: Are machine learning based android detectors resilient to reinforcement learning based adversarial attacks? Therefore, we propose the RL-MAGE framework to investigate the adversarial robustness of android malware detectors. The RL-MAGE framework assumes the grey-box scenario and aims to improve the adversarial robustness of malware detectors. We designed three reinforcement learning based evasion attacks A2C-MEA, TRPO-MEA, and PPO-MEA, against malware detectors. We investigated the robustness of 30 malware detection models based on 2 features (android permission and intent) and 15 distinct classifiers from 4 different families (machine learning classifiers, bagging based classifiers, boosting based classifiers, and deep learning classifiers). The designed evasion attacks generate adversarial applications by adding perturbations into the malware so that they force misclassifications and can evade malware detectors. The attack agent ensures that the adversarial applications’ structural, syntactical, and behavioral integrity is preserved, and the attack’s cost is minimized by adding minimum perturbations. The proposed TRPO-MEA evasion attack achieved a mean evasion rate of \\(93.27\\%\\) while reducing the mean accuracy of 30 malware detectors from \\(85.81\\%\\) to \\(50.29\\%\\). We also propose the ARShield defense strategy to improve the malware detectors’ classification performance and robustness. The TRPO-MEA ARShield models achieved \\(4.10\\%\\) higher mean accuracy and reduced the mean evasion rate of re-attack from \\(93.27\\%\\) to \\(1.05\\%\\). Finally, we conclude that the RL-MAGE framework improved the detection performance and adversarial robustness of malware detectors.}

	abstract = {To improve system resource utilization, multiple operators are co-located in the distributed stream processing systems. In the colocation scenarios, the node runtime environment and co-located operators affect each other. The existing methods mainly study the impact of the runtime environment on operator performance. However, there is still a lack of in-depth research on the interference of operator colocation to the runtime environment. It will lead to inaccurate prediction of the performance of the co-located operators, and further affect the effect of operator placement. To solve these problems, we propose an online runtime environment prediction method based on the operator portraits for complex colocation interference. The experimental results show that compared with the existing works, our method can not only accurately predict the runtime environment online, but also has strong scalability and continuous learning ability. It is worth noting that our method exhibits excellent online prediction performance for runtime environments in large-scale colocation scenarios.}

	abstract = {The amount of data generated daily grows tremendously in virtually all domains of science and industry, and its efficient storage, processing and analysis pose significant practical challenges nowadays. To automate the process of extracting useful insights from raw data, numerous supervised machine learning algorithms have been researched so far. They benefit from annotated training sets which are fed to the training routine which elaborates a model that is further deployed for a specific task. The process of capturing real-world data may lead to acquring noisy observations, ultimately affecting the models trained from such data. The impact of the label noise is, however, under-researched, and the robustness of classic learners against such noise remains unclear. We tackle this research gap and not only thoroughly investigate the classification capabilities of an array of widely-adopted machine learning models over a variety of contamination scenarios, but also suggest new metrics that could be utilized to quantify such models’ robustness. Our extensive computational experiments shed more light on the impact of training set contamination on the operational behavior of supervised learners.}

Our empirical experiment and analysis showed considerable improvement in LOS prediction with an XGBoost model RMSE score of 6.98 and R2 score of 38.24%.

	abstract = {Tensors are a widely used representations of multidimensional data in scientific and engineering applications. However, efficiently evaluating tensor expressions is still a challenging problem, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical operations. While many linear algebra libraries provide an Einsum function for tensor computations, it is rarely used, because Einsum is not yet common knowledge. Furthermore, tensor expressions in textbooks and scientific articles are often given in a form that can be implemented directly by using nested for-loops. As a result, many tensor expressions are evaluated using inefficient implementations. For making the direct evaluation of tensor expressions multiple orders of magnitude faster, we present a tool that automatically maps tensor expressions to highly tuned linear algebra libraries by leveraging the power of Einsum. Our tool is designed to simplify the process of implementing efficient tensor expressions, and thus making it easier to work with complex multidimensional data.}

	abstract = {Nowadays artificial neural network models achieve remarkable results in many disciplines. Functions mapping the representation provided by the model to the probability distribution are the inseparable aspect of deep learning solutions. Although softmax is a commonly accepted probability mapping function in the machine learning community, it cannot return sparse outputs and always spreads the positive probability to all positions. In this paper, we propose r-softmax, a modification of the softmax, outputting sparse probability distribution with controllable sparsity rate. In contrast to the existing sparse probability mapping functions, we provide an intuitive mechanism for controlling the output sparsity level. We show on several multi-label datasets that r-softmax outperforms other sparse alternatives to softmax and is highly competitive with the original softmax. We also apply r-softmax to the self-attention module of a pre-trained transformer language model and demonstrate that it leads to improved performance when fine-tuning the model on different natural language processing tasks.}

	abstract = {The paper presents the interval fast parametric integral equations system (IFPIES) applied to model and solve uncertainly defined curvilinear potential 2D boundary value problems with complex shapes. Contrary to previous research, the IFPIES is used to model the uncertainty of both boundary shape and boundary conditions. The IFPIES uses interval numbers and directed interval arithmetic with some modifications previously developed by the authors. Curvilinear segments in the form of Bézier curves of the third degree are used to model the boundary shape. However, the curves also required some modifications connected with applied directed interval arithmetic. It should be noted that simultaneous modelling of boundary shape and boundary conditions allows for a comprehensive approach to considered problems. The reliability and efficiency of the IFPIES solutions are verified on 2D complex potential problems with curvilinear domains. The solutions were compared with the interval solutions obtained by the interval PIES. All performed tests indicated the high efficiency of the IFPIES method.}

	abstract = {LocalMaxs algorithm extracts relevant Multiword Expressions from text corpora based on a statistical approach. However, statistical extractors face an increased challenge of obtaining good practical results, compared to linguistic approaches which benefit from language-specific, syntactic and/or semantic, knowledge. First, this paper contributes to an improvement to the LocalMaxs algorithm, based on a more selective evaluation of the cohesion of each Multiword Expressions candidate with respect to its neighbourhood, and a filtering criterion guided by the location of stopwords within each candidate. Secondly, a new language-independent method is presented for the automatic self-identification of stopwords in corpora, requiring no external stopwords lists or linguistic tools. The obtained results for LocalMaxs reach Precision values of about \\(80\\,\\%\\) for English, French, German and Portuguese, showing an increase of around \\(12-13\\,\\%\\) compared to the previous LocalMaxs version. The performance of the self-identification of stopwords reaches high Precision for top-ranked stopword candidates.\n}

	abstract = {Retrofitting damaged buildings is a challenge for engineers, since commercial software does not have the ability to consider the local damages and deformed shape of a building resulting from the mainshock record of an earthquake before applying the aftershock record. In this research, a computational method for retrofitting of damaged buildings under seismic mainshock-aftershock sequences is proposed, and proposed computational strategy is developed using Tcl programming code in OpenSees and MATLAB. Since the developed programming code has the ability of conducting nonlinear dynamic analysis (e.g. Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA)), different types of steel and reinforced concrete structures, assuming different intensity measures and engineering demands, can be on the benefit of this study. To present the ability of method, the 4-Story and 6-Story damaged steel structures were selected. Then, the linear Viscous Dampers (VDs) are used for retrofitting of the damaged structures, and IDAs were performed under aftershock records. The results showed that the proposed method and computational program could improve the seismic performance level of damaged structures subjected to the mainshock-aftershock sequences. In addition, the damaged floor level of the building is recognized by programming code and can be effectively considered for local retrofit schemes.}

The data, comprising over 152,000 comments, were collected from e-commerce sources and social media. In the present research, we propose a language-independent approach using machine translation, allowing for unified analysis of data from various countries. Furthermore, this study presents a real-life application, making it potentially beneficial for subsequent scientific research and other business applications. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the efficient modeling of colloquial language instead of medical jargon, which is often the focus of adverse event research. Both hierarchical and non-hierarchical classification approaches were tested using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers. The proposed feature extraction and selection process enabled us to include tokens important to minority classes in the dictionary. The F1 score was utilized to quantitatively assess the quality of classification. Hierarchical classification allowed for faster classification processes than the non-hierarchical approach for the XGBoost classifier. We obtained promising results for XGBoost; however, further research on a wider range of categories is required.}

	abstract = {Non-invasive estimation of chlorophyll content in plants plays an important role in precision agriculture. This task may be tackled using hyperspectral imaging that acquires numerous narrow bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, which may reflect subtle features of the plant, and inherently offers spatial scalability. Such imagery is, however, high-dimensional, therefore it is challenging to transfer from the imaging device, store and investigate. We propose a machine learning pipeline for estimating chlorophyll content from hyperspectral data. It benefits from the Savitzky-Golay filtering to smooth the (potentially noisy) spectral curves, and from gradient-based features extracted from such a smoothed signal. The experiments revealed that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art according to the widely-established estimation quality metrics obtained for four chlorophyll-related parameters.\n}

	abstract = {This article introduces an easy to implement kick-starting method for transfer learning of image recognition models, meant specifically for training with limited computational resources. The method has two components: (1) Principal Component Analysis transformations of per-filter representations and (2) explicit storage of compressed features. Apart from these two operations, the latent representation of an image is priorly obtained by transforming it via initial layers of the base (donor) model. Taking these measures saves a lot of computations, hence meaningfully speeding up the development. During further work with models, one can directly use the heavily compressed features instead of the original images each time. Despite having a large portion of the donor model frozen, this method yields satisfactory results in terms of prediction accuracy. Such a procedure can be useful for speeding up the early development stages of new models or lowering the potential cost of deployment.\n}

	abstract = {Similarity search is one of the most popular techniques for time series anomaly detection. This study proposes SAX-MP, a novel similarity search approach that combines Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation (SAX) and matrix profile (MP). The proposed SAX-MP method consists of two phases. The SAX method is used in the first phase to extract all of the subsequences of a time series, convert them to symbolic strings, and store these strings in an array. In the second phase, the proposed method calculates the MP based on the symbolic strings that are represented for all subsequences extracted in the first phase. Since a subsequence is represented by a symbolic string, the MP is calculated using a distance-based longest common subsequence rather than the z-normalized Euclidean distance. Top-k discords are detected based on the similarity MP. The proposed SAX-MP is implemented on several time series datasets. Experimental results reveal that the SAX-MP method is particularly effective at detecting anomalies when compared to HOT SAX and MP-based methods.}

The aim of Korpusomat is to bridge the gap between corpus linguistics, which requires tools for corpus analysis based on various linguistic annotations, and modern multilingual machine learning-based approaches to text processing. A special focus is placed on multilinguality: the platform currently serves 29 languages, but more can be easily added per user request. We discuss the use of Korpusomat in multidisciplinary research, and present a case study located at the intersection between discourse analysis and migration studies, based on a corpus generated and queried in the application. This provides a general framework for using the platform for research based on automatically annotated corpora, and demonstrates the usefulness of Korpusomat for supporting domain researchers in using computational science in their fields.\n}

We show that by radically reducing the number of the utilised nearest neighbours, introducing binary distances between the samples, and simplifying the loss function, the resulting IVHD algorithm still reconstructs with sufficient precision both local and, particularly, global properties of HDD topology. Although inferior to its competitors for the most moderate data sizes (\\(M\\) \\(10^5\\) samples), IVHD appears many times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms and reveals its power for multi-million-element datasets for which baseline methods fail in a reasonable computational time.}

Yet, it is a computationally expensive operation when using traditional numerical approaches, including finite-difference in the time and spectral domains. To address this issue, we develop a new data-driven surrogate model for fast and accurate calculation of the field radiation pattern. The method is based on the Fourier Neural Operator\xa0(FNO) technique. We show that we achieve a performance improvement of 31x when compared to the performance of the Meep CEM solver when running on a desktop laptop CPU at the cost of a small accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {Accounting with antirival tokens, i.e., accounting based on shareable units that gain value with increased use, enables efficient and effective collective action. However, most currencies are rival tokens which can naturally represent — and be exchanged to — rival goods, such as a cup of coffee. Antirival systems of account would be a natural fit for the economy of antirival goods because the logic of value creation and accounting would be compatible. It is challenging to find an allocatively efficient price for antirival goods, such as data, measured in rival units of account. We present an antirival accounting system based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), where the fundamental operation is sharing instead of exchanging and study it with system dynamics models and simulations. We illustrate our arguments by presenting a system known as Streamr Awards that defines three tokens of a fundamentally novel type, shareable non-fungible token (sNFT). We present the functioning of one of these in the work allocation of a self-directed online community.}

	abstract = {We propose a new autoencoder preserving input functions’ general shape (monotonicity, convexity) after their reconstruction without imposing a priori constraints. These properties are inherent to the coefficients of the Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials that serve here as theoretical descriptors. Their estimates, computed from noisy observations by the coder, play the role of latent variables. The approach is purely nonparametric, i.e., no prior finite-dimensional model is assumed. The answer to the question of how many latent variables should be used for an acceptable reconstruction accuracy of a family of functional data is inferred from learning based on the proposed approximation of the Akaike Information Criterion. A distinguishing feature of this autoencoder is that the coder and encoder are designed as precomputed and stored matrices with the Bernstein polynomial entries. Thus, after selecting the number of latent variables, the autoencoder usage has a low computational complexity since it is linear with respect to observations. The proposed computational algorithms are tested on real data arising in mechanical engineering when control of damping vibrations is necessary.}

Existing methods often utilize a sequential multi-task learning approach, in which the arbitral decomposition causes the current task to depend only on the previous one, missing the possible existence of the more complex relationships between them. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning framework with bidirectional memory-like dependency between tasks to address those drawbacks and perform the joint problem more accurately. Our empirical studies show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on the BioCreative V CDR corpus.}

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great capabilities in dealing with sequential decision-making problems, but its performance is often bounded by suboptimal solutions in many complex applications. This paper proposes the use of human expertise to increase the performance of deep RL methods. Human domain knowledge is characterized by heuristic rules and they are utilized adaptively to alter either the reward signals or environment states during the learning process of deep RL. This prevents deep RL methods from being trapped in local optimal solutions and computationally expensive training process and thus allowing them to maximize their performance when carrying out designated tasks. The proposed approach is experimented with a video game developed using the Arcade Learning Environment. With the extra information provided at the right time by human experts via heuristic rules, deep RL methods show greater performance compared with circumstances where human knowledge is not used. This implies that our approach of utilizing human expertise for deep RL has helped to increase the performance of deep RL and it has a great potential to be generalized and applied to solve complex real-world decision-making problems efficiently.}

Next, its performance is experimentally evaluated and it is shown that it outperforms other existing solutions.}

Specifically, the formation of a dataset and the selection of appropriate samples for experimentation are expounded upon. Comparisons of the quality of generation for various topics, obtained using thematic modeling of the titles of questions and tags, were carried out. In the absence of consideration of the structures and themes of texts, it can be difficult to train models, so the question is being investigated whether thematic modeling of questions can help in solving the problem. Fine-tuning of GPT-neo for each topic is undertaken as a part of experimental process.\n}

	abstract = {Stress has become part of the day-to-day life in the modern world. A major pathological repercussion of chronic stress (CS) is Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Modelling T2D as a complex biological system involves combining under-the-skin and outside-the-skin parameters to properly define the dynamics involved. In this study, a compartmental model is built based on the various inter-players that constitute the hallmarks involved in the progression of this disease. Various compartments that constitute this model are tested in a glucose-disease progression setting with the help of an adjacent minimal model. Temporal dynamics of the glucose-disease progression was simulated to explore the contribution of different model parameters to T2D onset. The model simulations reveal CS as a critical modulator of T2D disease progression.}

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn via experience to solve almost every problem. However, the ANN application in a new task entails a necessity to perform some additional adaptations. First is fitting the ANNs type or structure by applying the various number of hidden layers and neurons in it or using different activation functions or other parameters, allowing ANN to learn the stated task. The second is the validation and verification methods of the ANN quality that should be suited to the stated task. Occasionally the differences between the ANNs output are significant, and it is easy to choose the best network. However, sometimes the differences pronounced by standard performance parameters are minor, and it is difficult to distinguish which ANN has reached the best level of training. This paper presents the results of training the ANN to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of the airborne contaminant over a city domain. Statistical performance measures have validated the trained ANNs performance. Finally, new measures allowing to judge of both time and spatial distribution of the ANN output have been proposed and used to select the prior ANN.}

Although there have been a lot of approaches to detecting fake news in textual format only, multimodal approaches are less frequent as it is difficult to fully use the information derived from different modalities to achieve high accuracy in a combined format. To tackle these issues, we introduce DeBertNeXT, a multimodal fake news detection model that utilizes textual and visual information from an article for fake news classification. We perform experiments on the immense Fakeddit dataset and two smaller benchmark datasets, Politifact and Gossipcop. Our model outperforms the existing models on the Fakeddit dataset by about 3.80%, Politifact by 2.10% and Gossipcop by 1.00%.}

	abstract = {The distance similarity search (DSS) is a fundamental operation for large-scale data analytics, as it is used to find all points that are within a search distance of a query point. Given that new scientific instruments are generating a tremendous amount of data, it is critical that these searches are highly efficient. Recently, GPU algorithms have been proposed to parallelize the DSS. While most work shows that GPU algorithms largely outperform parallel CPU algorithms, there is no single GPU algorithm that outperforms all other state-of-the-art approaches; therefore, it is not clear which algorithm should be selected based on a dataset/workload. We compare two GPU DSS algorithms: one that indexes directly on the data coordinates, and one that indexes using the distances between data points to a set of reference points. A counterintuitive finding is that the data dimensionality is not a good indicator of which algorithm should be used on a given dataset. We also find that the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) which quantifies structure in the data can be used to parameter tune the algorithms to improve performance over the baselines reported in prior work. Lastly, we find that combining the data dimensionality and ID can be used to select between the best performing GPU algorithm on a dataset.}

	abstract = {In this study, selected machine learning (ML) approaches were used to detect anxiety in Indonesian-language YouTube video comments about COVID-19 and the government’s program. The dataset consisted of 9706 comments categorized as positive and negative. The study utilized ML approaches, such as KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support Vector Machine), DT (Decision Tree), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and XG-Boost, to analyze and classify comments as anxious or not anxious. The data was preprocessed by tokenizing, filtering, stemming, tagging, and emoticon conversion. Feature extraction (FE) is performed by CV (count-vectorization), TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), Word2Vec (Word Embedding), and HV (Hashing-Vectorizer) algorithms. The 24 of the ML and FE algorithms combinations were used to achieve the best performance in anxiety detection. The combination of RF and CV obtained the best accuracy of 98.4%, which is 14.3% points better than the previous research. In addition, the other ML methods accuracy was above 92% for CV, TF-IDF, and HV, while KNN obtained the lowest accuracy.}

This paper describes a methodology for AI parallel applications that analyses the performance and efficiency of these applications running on HPC resources to make decisions and select the most appropriate system resources. We validate our proposal by analysing the efficiency of the K-Means application obtaining an efficiency of 99% on a target machine.}

	abstract = {Biometric identification from heart rate sequences provides a simple yet effective mechanism, that can neither be reverse engineered nor replicated, to protect user privacy. This study employs a highly efficient time series classification (TSC) algorithm, miniROCKET, to identify users by their heart rate. The approach adopted in this study employs user heart rate data, a simplified form of heart activity, captured during exercise, filtered, and contextualized within exercise routines, for user classification. Results from this study are empirically evaluated on a real-world data set, containing 115,082 workouts across 304 users, by three other state-of-the-art TSC algorithms. Our experiments showed that for 36 users, the variance explained by heart rate feature is 74.0%, when coupled with speed and altitude, the variance increases to 94.0%. For 304 users, the variance explained by heart-rate is 32.8% and increased to 65.9% with contextual features. This exploratory study highlights the potential of heart rate as a biometric identifier. It also underscores how contextual factors, such as speed and altitude change, can improve classification of timeseries data when coupled with smart data preprocessing.\n}

	abstract = {This paper explores the performance of the T5 text-to-text transfer-transformer language model together with some other generative models on the task of generating keywords from abstracts of scientific papers. Additionally, we evaluate the possibility of transferring keyword extraction and generation models tuned on scientific text collections to labelling news stories. The evaluation is carried out on the English component of the POSMAC corpus, a new corpus whose release is announced in this paper. We compare the intrinsic and extrinsic performance of the models tested, i.e. T5 and mBART, which seem to perform similarly, although the former yields better results when transferred to the domain of news stories. A combination of the POSMAC and InTechOpen corpus seems optimal for the task at hand. We also make a number of observations about the quality and limitations of datasets used for keyword extraction and generation.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we systematically investigated the adsorption characteristics, electronic structure(DOS), band structure and thermal stability of diamond surface with Hydrogen terminals. We found that the most stable adsorption performance may occur on (100) surface. The adsorption stability of hydrogen atom on plane (110) is the second, and the worst on plane (111). A very shallow acceptor level is introduced through Hydrogen termination, explaining the ideal p-type diamond characteristics. The stability of the hydrogen terminal structure decreases as temperature rises. This structure has deteriorated significantly since 400\xa0K, and the instability of the hydrogen-terminated structure on the surface is the root cause of the decrease in the hole concentration of hydrogen-terminated diamond at high temperature.}

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) offers numerous applications, including student success prediction, which assists educators in identifying the customized support required to improve a student’s performance in a course. To make accurate decisions, intelligent algorithms utilized for this task take into account various factors related to student success. Despite their effectiveness, decisions produced by these models can be rendered ineffective by a lack of explainability and trust. Earlier research has endeavored to address these difficulties by employing overarching explainability methods like examining feature significance and dependency analysis. Nevertheless, these approaches fall short of meeting the unique necessities of individual students when it comes to determining the causal effect of distinct features. This paper addresses the aforementioned gap by employing multiple machine learning models on a real-world dataset that includes information on various social media usage purposes and usage times of students, to predict whether they will pass or fail their respective courses. By utilizing Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), we conduct a thorough analysis of the model outcomes. Our findings indicate that several social media usage scenarios, if altered, could enable students who would have otherwise received a failing grade to attain a passing grade. Furthermore, we conducted a user study among a group of educators to gather their viewpoints on the use of counterfactuals in explaining the prediction of student success through artificial intelligence.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we developed a 3D viscoelastic analysis solver with a data-driven method on GPUs for fast computation of highly detailed 3D crustal structure models. Here, the initial solution is obtained with high accuracy using a data-driven predictor based on previous time-step results, which reduces the number of multi-grid solver iterations and thus reduces the computation cost. To realize memory saving and high performance on GPUs, the previous time step results are compressed by multiplying a random matrix, and multiple Green’s functions are solved simultaneously to improve the memory-bound matrix-vector product kernel. The developed GPU-based solver attained an 8.6-fold speedup from the state-of-art multi-grid solver when measured on compute nodes of AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The fast analysis method enabled calculating 372 viscoelastic Green’s functions for a large-scale 3D crustal model of the Nankai Trough region with \\(4.2\\times 10^9\\) degrees of freedom within 333\xa0s per time step using 160 A100 GPUs, and such results were used to estimate coseismic slip distribution.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the implementation of a coupled numerical analysis of the Earth’s magnetospheric dynamics and spacecraft charging (SC) processes based on our in-house Code-To-Code Adapter (CoToCoA). The basic idea is that the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation reproduces the global dynamics of the magnetospheric plasma, and its pressure and density data at local spacecraft positions are provided and used for the SC calculations. This allows us to predict spacecraft charging that reflects the dynamic changes of the space environment. CoToCoA defines three types of independent programs: Requester, Worker, and Coupler, which are executed simultaneously in the analysis. Since the MHD side takes the role of invoking the SC analysis, Requester and Worker positions are assigned to the MHD and SC calculations, respectively. Coupler then supervises necessary coordination between them. Physical data exchange between the models is implemented using MPI remote memory access functions. The developed program has been tested to ensure that it works properly as a coupled physical model. The numerical experiments also confirmed that the addition of the SC calculations has a rather small impact on the MHD simulation performance with up to about 500-process executions.}

	abstract = {Sparse modeling or model selection with categorical data is challenging even for a moderate number of variables, because roughly one parameter is needed to encode one category or level. The Group Lasso is a well known efficient algorithm for selection of continuous or categorical variables, but all estimates related to a selected factor usually differ. Therefore, a fitted model may not be sparse, which makes the model interpretation difficult. To obtain a sparse solution of the Group Lasso, we propose the following two-step procedure: first, we reduce data dimensionality using the Group Lasso; then, to choose the final model, we use an information criterion on a small family of models prepared by clustering levels of individual factors. In the consequence, our procedure reduces dimensionality of the Group Lasso and strongly improves interpretability of the final model. What is important, this reduction results only in the small increase of the prediction error. In the paper we investigate selection correctness of the algorithm in a sparse high-dimensional scenario. We also test our method on synthetic as well as the real data sets and show that it outperforms the state of the art algorithms with respect to the prediction accuracy, model dimension and execution time. Our procedure is contained in the R package DMRnet and available in the CRAN repository.}

Vast amount of communication needed in order to make each body acquainted with the information on position of other bodies renders the accurate solutions very quickly inefficient and unreasonable. Many approximate approaches have been proposed, and the one introduced in this paper relies on actor-based concurrency, making the whole design and implementation significantly easier than using, e.g. MPI. In addition to presenting three methods, we provide the reader with tangible preliminary results that pave the way for future development of the constructed simulation system.}

	abstract = {The intracellular material transport plays a crucial role in supporting a neuron cell’s survival and function. The disruption of transport may lead to the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is essential to study how neurons regulate the material transport process and have a better understanding of the traffic jam formation. Here, we present to model the neuron material transport process and study the traffic jam phenomena during transport using isogeometric analysis (IGA) and deep learning. We first develop an IGA-based platform for material transport simulation in complex neuron morphologies. A graph neural network (GNN)-based deep learning model is then proposed to learn from the IGA simulation and provide fast material concentration prediction within different neuron morphologies. To study the traffic jam phenomena, we develop a PDE-constrained optimization model to simulate the material transport regulation within neuron and explain the traffic jam caused by reduced number of microtubules (MTs) and MT swirls. A novel IGA-based physics-informed graph neural network (PGNN) is proposed to quickly predict normal and abnormal transport phenomena such as traffic jam in different neuron morphologies. The proposed methods help in discovering several spatial patterns of the transport process and provide key insights into how neurons mediate the material transport process within their complex morphology.\n}

	abstract = {In this work, we develop a method for integrating an AI model with a CFD solver to predict chemical mixing simulations’ output. The proposed AI model is based on a deep neural network with a variational autoencoder that is managed by our AI supervisor. We demonstrate that the developed method allows us to accurately accelerate the steady-state simulations of chemical reactions performed with the MixIT solver from Tridiagonal solutions. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy and performance of AI-accelerated simulations, considering three different scenarios: i) prediction in cases with the same geometry of mesh as used during training the model, ii) with a modified geometry of tube in which the ingredients are mixed, iii) with a modified geometry of impeller used to mix the ingredients. Our AI model is trained on a dataset containing 1500 samples of simulated scenarios and can accurately predict the process of chemical mixing under various conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy exceeding 90% and reduces the execution time up to 9 times.}

	abstract = {Monte Carlo integration is a widely used quadrature rule to solve Partial Differential Equations with neural networks due to its ability to guarantee overfitting-free solutions and high-dimensional scalability. However, this stochastic method produces noisy losses and gradients during training, which hinders a proper convergence diagnosis. Typically, this is overcome using an immense (disproportionate) amount of integration points, which deteriorates the training performance. This work proposes a memory-based Monte Carlo integration method that produces accurate integral approximations without requiring the high computational costs of processing large samples during training.\n}

	abstract = {Advection-dominated diffusion is a challenging computational problem that requires special stabilization efforts. Unfortunately, the numerical solution obtained with the commonly used Galerkin method delivers unexpected oscillation resulting in an inaccurate numerical solution. The theoretical background resulting from the famous inf-sup condition tells us that the finite-dimensional test space employed by the Galerkin method does not allow us to reach the supremum necessary for problem stability. We enlarge the test space to overcome this problem. We do it for a fixed trial space. The method that allows us to do so is the residual minimization method. This method, however, requires the solution to a much larger system of linear equations than the standard Galerkin method. We represent the larger test space by its set of optimal test functions, forming a basis of the same dimension as the trial space in the Galerkin method. The resulting Petrov-Galerkin method stabilizes our challenging advection-dominated problem. We train the optimal test functions offline with the neural network to speed up the computations. We also observe that the optimal test functions, usually global, can be approximated with local support functions, resulting in a low computational cost for the solver and a stable numerical solution.\n}

	abstract = {Cloud computing is gaining popularity in the context of high-performance computing applications. Among other things, the use of cloud resources allows advanced simulations to be carried out in circumstances where local computing resources are limited. At the same time, the use of cloud computing may increase costs. This article presents an original approach which uses anomaly detection and machine learning for predicting cloud resource usage in the long term, making it possible to optimize resource usage (through an appropriate resource reservation plan) and reduce its cost. The solution developed uses the XGBoost model for long-term prediction of cloud resource consumption, which is especially important when these resources are used for advanced long-term simulations. Experiments conducted using real-life data from a production system demonstrate that the use of the XGBoost model developed for prediction allowed the quality of predictions to be improved (by 16%) compared to statistical methods. Moreover, techniques using the XGBoost model were able to predict chaotic changes in resource consumption as opposed to statistical methods.\n}

	abstract = {We present the hierarchical matrix compression algorithms to speed up the computations to solve unstable space-time finite element method. Namely, we focus on the non-stationary time-dependent advection dominated diffusion problem solved by using space-time finite element method. We formulate the problem on the space-time mesh, where two axes of coordinates system denote the spatial dimension, and the third axis denotes the temporal dimension. By employing the space-time mesh, we avoid time iterations, and we solve the problem “at once” by calling a solver once for the entire mesh. This problem, however, is challenging, and it requires the application of special stabilization methods. We propose the stabilization method based on least-squares. We derive the space-time formulation, and solve it using adaptive finite element method. To speed up the solution process, we compress the matrix of the space-time formulation using the low-rank compression algorithm. We show that the compressed matrix allows for quasi-linear computational cost matrix-vector multiplication. Thus, we apply the GMRES solver with hierarchical matrix-vector multiplications. Summing up, we propose a quasi-linear computational cost solver for stabilized space-time formulations of advection dominated diffusion problem.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing resource management is a critical component of the modern cloud computing platforms, aimed to manage computing resources for a given application by minimizing the cost of the infrastructure while maintaining a Quality-of-Service (QoS) conditions. This task is usually solved using rule-based policies. Due to their limitations more complex solutions, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents are being researched. Unfortunately, deploying such agents in a production environment can be seen as risky because of the lack of transparency of DRL decision-making policies. There is no way to know why a certain decision is made. To foster the trust in DRL generated policies it is important to provide means of explaining why certain decisions were made given a specific input. In this paper we present a tool applying the Integrated Gradients (IG) method to Deep Neural Networks used by DRL algorithms. This allowed to obtain feature attributions that show the magnitude and direction of each feature’s influence on the agent’s decision. We verify the viability of the proposed solution by applying it to a number of sample use cases with different DRL agents.}

	abstract = {This paper discusses the use of optimal control for improving the performance of industrial processes. Industry 4.0 technologies play a crucial role in this approach by providing real-time data from physical devices. Additionally, simulations and virtual sensors allow for proactive control of the process by predicting potential issues and taking measures to prevent them. The paper proposes a new methodology for proactive control based on machine learning techniques that combines physical and virtual sensor data obtained from a simulation model. A deep temporal clustering algorithm is used to identify the process stage, and a control scheme directly dependent on this stage is used to determine the appropriate control actions to be taken. The control scheme is created by an expert human, based on the best industrial practices, making the whole process fully interpretable. The performance of the developed solution is demonstrated using a case study of gas production from an underground reservoir. The results show that the proposed algorithm can provide proactive control, reducing downtime, increasing process reliability, and improving performance.\n}

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the concurrent integration applied to the 3D isogeometric finite element method. It has been proven that integration over individual elements with Gaussian quadrature is independent of each other, and a concurrent algorithm for integrating a single element has been created. The suboptimal integration algorithm over each element is developed as a sequence of basic atomic computational tasks, and the dependency relation between them is identified. We show how to prepare independent sets of tasks that can be automatically executed concurrently on a GPU card. This is done with the help of Diekert’s graph, which expresses the dependency between tasks. The execution time of the concurrent GPU integration is compared with the sequential integration executed on CPU.}

	abstract = {Contemporary neuroscience is highly focused on the synergistic use of machine learning and network analysis. Indeed, network neuroscience analysis intensively capitalizes on clustering metrics and statistical tools. In this context, the integrated analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) provides complementary information about the electrical and hemodynamic activity of the brain. Evidence supports the mechanism of the neurovascular coupling mediates brain processing. However, it is not well understood how the specific patterns of neuronal activity are represented by these techniques. Here we have investigated the topological properties of functional networks of the resting-state brain between synchronous EEG and fNIRS connectomes, across frequency bands, using source space analysis, and through graph theoretical approaches. We observed that at global-level analysis small-world topology network features for both modalities. The edge-wise analysis pointed out increased inter-hemispheric connectivity for oxy-hemoglobin compared to EEG, with no differences across the frequency bands. Our results show that graph features extracted from fNIRS can reflect both short- and long-range organization of neural activity, and that is able to characterize the large-scale network in the resting state. Further development of integrated analyses of the two modalities is required to fully benefit from the added value of each modality. However, the present study highlights that multimodal source space analysis approaches can be adopted to study brain functioning in healthy resting states, thus serving as a foundation for future work during tasks and in pathology, with the possibility of obtaining novel comprehensive biomarkers for neurological diseases.}

	abstract = {Anomalies of gait sequences are detected on the basis of an autoencoder strategy in which input data are reconstructed from their embeddings. The denoising dense low-dimensional and sparse high-dimensional autoencoders are applied for segments of time series representing 3D rotations of the skeletal body parts. The outliers - misreconstructed time segments - are determined and classified as abnormal gait fragments. In the validation stage, motion capture data registered in the virtual reality of the Human Dynamics and Multimodal Interaction Laboratory of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology equipped with Motek CAREN Extended hardware and software are used. The scenarios with audio and visual stimuli are prepared to enforce anomalies during a walk. The acquired data are labeled by a human, which results in the visible and invisible anomalies extracted. The neural network representing the autoencoder is trained using anomaly-free data and validated by the complete ones. AP (Average Precision) and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under Curve) measures are calculated to assess detection performance. The influences of the number of neurons of the hidden layer, the length of the analyzed time segments and the variance of injected Gaussian noise are investigated. The obtained results, with AP \\(=0.46\\) and ROC-AUC \\(=0.71\\), are promising.}

	abstract = {This work presents the computational modeling of solid tumor treatments with hyperthermia using magnetic nanoparticles, considering a bioheat transfer model proposed by Pennes(1948). The simulations consider a tumor seated in a muscle layer. The model was described with a partial differential equation, and its solution was approximated using the finite difference method in a heterogeneous porous medium using a Forward Time Centered Space scheme. Moreover, the Monte Carlo method was employed to quantify the uncertainties of the quantities of interest (QoI) considered in the simulations. The QoI considers uncertainties in three different parameters: 1) the angulation of blood vessels, 2) the magnitude of blood flow, and 3) the number of blood vessels per tissue unit. Since Monte Carlo demands several executions of the model and solving a partial differential equation in a bi-dimensional domain demands significant computational time, we use the OpenMP parallel programming API to speed up the simulations. The results of the in silico experiments showed that considering the uncertainties presented in the three parameters studied, it is possible to plan hyperthermia treatment to ensure that the entire tumor area reaches the target temperature that leads to damage.}

	abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an important technique used in neuroimaging. It features a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which poses a challenge, especially at stronger diffusion weighting. A common solution to the resulting poor precision is to average signal from multiple identical measurements. Indeed, averaging the magnitude signal is sufficient if the noise is sampled from a distribution with zero mean value. However, at low SNR, the magnitude signal is increased by the rectified noise floor, such that the accuracy can only be maintained if averaging is performed on the complex signal. Averaging of the complex signal is straightforward in the non-diffusion-weighted images, however, in the presence of diffusion encoding gradients, any motion of the tissue will incur a phase shift in the signal which must be corrected prior to averaging. Instead, they are averaged in the modulus image space, which is associated with the effect of Rician bias. Moreover, repeated acquisitions further increase acquisition times which, in turn, exacerbate the challenges of patient motion. In this paper, we propose a method to correct phase variations using a neural network trained on synthetic MR data. Then, we train another network using the Noise2Noise paradigm to denoise real dMRI of the brain. We show that phase correction made Noise2Noise training possible and that the latter improved the denoising quality over averaging modulus domain images.}

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop a method for automated, fast and accurate geometric modeling of blood vessels from 3D images, robust to image limited resolution, noise and artefacts. Within the centerline-radius paradigm, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to approximate the mapping from the image cross-sections to vessel lumen parameters. A six-parameter image formation model is utilized to derive conditions for this mapping to exist, and to generate images for the CNN training, validation and testing. The trained networks are applied to real-life time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance images (MRI) of a blood-flow phantom. Excellent agreement is observed between the predictions made by the CNN and those obtained via model fitting as the reference method. The latter is a few orders of magnitude slower than the CNN and suffers from local minima problem. The CNN is also trained and tested on publicly available contrast-enhanced (CE) computed tomography angiography (CTA) clinical datasets. It accurately predicts the coronary-tree lumen parameters in seconds, compared to hours needed by human experts. The method can be an aid to vascular diagnosis and automated annotation of images.}

	abstract = {Processing and classification of surface EMG signals is a challenging computational problem that has received increasing attention for at least two decades. When multichannel EMG signals are transformed into spectrograms, classification can be performed using multilinear features that can be extracted from a set of spectrograms by various tensor decomposition methods. In this study, we propose to use one of the most efficient tensor network models, i.e. the tensor train decomposition method and to combine it with the tensor subspace analysis to extract the more discriminant 2D features from multi-way data. Numerical experiments, carried out on surface EMG signals registered during hand gesture actions, demonstrated that the proposed feature extraction method outperforms well-known tensor decomposition methods in terms of classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {This paper presents an original approach to the image reconstruction problem for spiral CT scanners where the FFS (Flying Focal Spot) technology in an x-ray tube is implemented. The geometry of those scanners causes problems for CT systems based on traditional (FDK) reconstruction methods. Therefore, we propose rebinning strategy, i.e. a scheme with abstract parallel geometry of x-rays, where these problems do not occur. As a consequence, we can reconstruct an image from projections with a non-equiangular distribution, present in the Flying Focal Spot technology. Our method is based on statistical model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), where the reconstruction problem is formulated as a shift-invariant system. The statistical fundamentals of the proposed method allow for a reduction of the x-ray dose absorbed by patients during examinations. Performed simulations showed that our method overcomes the traditional approach regarding the quality of the obtained images and an x-ray dose needed to complete an examination procedure.}

	abstract = {Through an overview of the history of the disease, Narrative Medicine (NM) aims to define and implement an effective, appropriate and shared treatment path. In the context of COVID-19, several blogs were produced, among those the “Sindrome Post COVID-19” contains narratives related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, different analysis techniques were applied to a dataset extracted from such “Sindrome Post COVID-19” blog. The first step of the analysis was to test the VADER polarity extraction tool. Then the analysis was extended through the application of Topic Modeling, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results were compared to verify the correlations between the polarity score obtained through VADER and the extracted topics through LDA. The results showed a predominantly negative polarity consistent with the mostly negative topics represented by words on post virus symptoms. The results obtained derive from three different approaches applied to the COVID narrative dataset. The first part of the analysis corresponds to polarity extraction using the VADER software, where, from the score, polarity was inferred by dichotomizing the overall score. In the second part, topic modeling through LDA was applied, extracting a number of topics equal to three. The third phase is based on the objective of finding a qualitative relationship between the polarity extracted with VADER and the latent topics with LDA, considering it a semi-supervised problem. In the end, the presence of polarized topics was explored and thus a correspondence between sentiment and topic was found.}

	abstract = {The human brain is an enormous scientific challenge. Knowledge of the complete map of neural connections (connectome) is essential for understanding how neural circuits encode information and the brain works in health and disease. Nanoscale connectomes are created for a few small animals but not for human. Moreover, existing models and data formats for neuron morphology description are “merely” at the microscale. This work (1) formulates a complete set of morphologic parameters of the entire neuron at the nanoscale and introduces a new neuronal nanoscale data format; (2) proposes four geometric neuronal models: straight wireframe, enhanced wireframe, straight polygonal, and enhanced polygonal, based on the introduced neuronal format; and (3) estimates storage required for these neuronal models. The straight wireframe model requires 18 petabytes (PB). The parabolic wireframe model needs 36\xa0PB and the cubic model 54\xa0PB. The straight polygonal model requires 24\xa0PB. The parabolic polygonal model needs 48\xa0PB and the cubic model 72\xa0PB. To my best knowledge, this is the first work providing for the human brain (1) the complete set of neuronal morphology parameters, (2) neuronal nanoscale data format, and (3) storage requirement estimation for volumetric and geometric neuronal morphology models at the micro and nanoscales. This work opens an avenue in human brain nanoscale modeling enabling the estimation of computing resources required for the calculation of the nanoscale connectome.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to replace the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The FHN model, a system of two ordinary differential equations, is widely used in electrophysiology and neurophysiology to simulate cell action potentials. However, in tasks such as whole-organ electrophysiology modeling and drug testing, the numerical solution of millions of cell models is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose using PINNs to accurately approximate the two variables of the FHN model at any time instant, any initial condition, and a wide range of parameters. In particular, this eliminates the need for causality after training. We employed time window marching and increased point cloud density on transition regions to improve the training of the neural network due to nonlinearity, sharp transitions, unstable equilibrium, and bifurcations of parameters. The PINNs were generated using NVIDIA’s Modulus framework, allowing efficient deployment on modern GPUs. Our results show that the generated PINNs could reproduce FHN solutions with average numerical errors below 0.5%, making them a promising lightweight computational model for electrophysiology and neurophysiology research.}

	abstract = {Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves a complex sequence of events in distinct spatiotemporal scales for which the cause is not completely understood. The representation of such biological phenomena using mathematical models can be useful to gain insights and test hypotheses to improve the understanding of the disease and find new courses of action to either prevent it or treat it with fewer collateral effects. To represent all stages of the disease, such mathematical models are frequently computationally demanding. This work presents a comparison of parallel programming strategies to optimize the execution time of a spatiotemporal two-compartmental mathematical model to represent plaque formation in MS and apply the best strategy found to perform the sensitivity analysis of the model.}

	abstract = {This study aims to develop new classifiers that can effectively integrate and analyze biomedical data obtained from various sources through high-throughput technologies. The use of explainable models is particularly important as they offer insights into the relationships and patterns within the data, which leads to a better understanding of the underlying processes. The objective of this research is to examine the effectiveness of decision trees combined with Relative eXpression Analysis (RXA) for classifying multi-omics data. Several concepts for integrating separated data are verified, based on different pair relationships between the features. Within the study, we propose a multi-test approach that combines linked top-scoring pairs from different omics in each internal node of the hierarchical classification model. To address the significant computational challenges raised by RXA, the most time-consuming aspects are parallelized using a GPU. The proposed solution was experimentally validated using single and multi-omics datasets. The results show that the proposed concept generates more accurate and interpretable predictions than commonly used tree-based solutions.}
