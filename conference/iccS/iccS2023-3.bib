	abstract = {The paper deals with mining imbalanced multiclass datasets. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the performance of several balancing agents implemented by the authors. Agents have been constructed from 5 state-of-the-art classifiers designed originally for mining binary imbalanced datasets. To transform binary classifiers into multiclass ones, we use the one-versus-one (OVO) approach making use of the collective decision taken by the majority voting. The paper describes our approach and provides detailed description of the respective balancing agents. Their performance is evaluated in an extensive computational experiment. The experiment involved multiclass imbalanced datasets from the Keel imbalanced datasets repository. Experiment results allowed to select best performing balancing agents using statistical tools.}

	abstract = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a system developed for maritime traffic monitoring and control. The system is based on an obligatory automatic exchange of information transmitted by the ships. The Satellite-AIS is a next generation of AIS system based on a satellite component that allows AIS to operate with a greater range. However, due to technical limitations, some AIS data collected by the satellite component are damaged, which means that AIS messages might contain errors or unspecified (missing) values. Thus, the problem of reconstruction of the damaged AIS data needs to be considered for improving performance of the Satellite-AIS in general. The problem is still open from research point of view. The aim of the paper is to compare selected decision tree based algorithms for detecting the damaged AIS messages. A general concept of detection of the damaged AIS data is presented. Then, the assumption and results of the computational experiment are reported, together with final conclusions.}

	abstract = {Interaction with others influences our opinions and behaviours. Our activities within various social circles lead to different opinions expressed in various situations, groups, and ways of communication. Earlier studies on agent-based modelling of conformism within networks were based on a single-layer approach. Contrary to that, in this work, we propose a model incorporating conformism in which a person can share different continuous opinions on different layers depending on the social circle. Afterwards, we extend the model with more components that are known to influence opinions, e.g. authority or openness to new views. These two models are then compared to show that only sole conformism leads to opinion convergence.}

	abstract = {Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods support stakeholders in solving decision-making problems in an environment that simultaneously considers multiple criteria whose objectives are often conflicting. These methods allow the application of numerical weights representing the relevance of criteria and, based on the provided decision matrices with performances of alternatives, calculate their scores based on which rankings are created. MCDA methods differ in their algorithms and can calculate the scores of alternatives given constructed reference solutions or focus on finding compromise solutions. An essential initial step in many MCDA methods is the normalization procedure of the input decision matrix, which can be performed using various techniques. The possibility of using different normalization techniques implies getting different results. Also, the imprecision of the data provided by decision-makers can affect the results of MCDA procedures. This paper investigates the effect of normalizations other than the default on the variability of the results of three MCDA methods: Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS), Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The research demonstrated that the normalization type’s impact is noticeable and differs depending on the explored MCDA method. The results of the investigation highlight the importance of benchmarking different methods and techniques in order to select the method that gives solutions most robust to the application of different computing methods supporting MCDA procedures and input data imprecision.}

	abstract = {We revisit literature about school choice and school segregation from the perspective of complexity theory. This paper argues that commonly found features of complex systems are all present in the mechanisms of school segregation. These features emerge from the interdependence between households, their interactions with school attributes and the institutional contexts in which they reside. We propose that a social complexity perspective can add to providing new generative explanations of resilient patterns of school segregation and may help identifying policies towards robust school integration. This requires a combination of theoretically informed computational modeling with empirical data about specific social and institutional contexts. We argue that this combination is missing in currently employed methodologies in the field. Pathways and challenges for developing it are discussed and examples are presented demonstrating how new insights and possible policies countering it can be obtained for the cases of primary school segregation in the city of Amsterdam.}

In this regard, the network nodes can represent members of a parliament, and each edge weight aims to be a probabilistic proxy for the alignment between the edge endpoints. In order to achieve such a goal, different methods to quantify the agreement between peers based on their voting records were carefully considered and compared from a theoretical as well as an experimental point of view. The results confirm the usefulness of the ideas herein presented, and which are flexible enough to be employed in any scenario which can be characterized by the probabilistic agreement of its components.}

This article details the analysis of relations between members of the lower house of the National Congress of Brazil during the term of office between 2011 and 2015 according to transcriptions of their house speeches. In order to accomplish this goal, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning were used to assess pairwise relationships between members of the congress which were then observed from the perspective of Complex Networks. Node clustering was used to evaluate multiple speech-based measures of distance between each pair of political peers, as well as the resulting cohesion of their political parties. Experimental results showed that one of the proposed measures, based on aggregating similarities between each pair of speeches, is superior to a previously established alternative of considering concatenations of these elements relative to each individual when targeting to group parliamentarians organically.}

The problem is formulated as a bounded single objective optimization problem. The performance and efficiency of the algorithms are compared under various scenarios using noise-contaminated data. The results show that these meta-heuristics are powerful methods for global optimization and are suitable for solving the damage detection problem. The study compares the performance of these algorithms in: (1) identifying the location and extent of damaged elements, and (2) robustness to noisy data. The proposed meta-heuristic algorithms show promise for solving the damage detection problem. Particularly, the GSK-ALI, MRFO, and Jaya algorithms demonstrate superior performance compared to the other algorithms in identifying damaged elements within concrete plate structures.}

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on access to crucial diagnostic procedures for breast cancer patients, including screenings and treatments. To quantify the impact of the lockdowns on patient outcomes and cost, the study employs a mathematical model of breast cancer progression. The model includes ten different states that represent various stages of health and disease, along with the four different stages of cancer that can be diagnosed or undiagnosed. The study employs a natural history stochastic model to simulate the progression of breast cancer in patients. The model includes transition probabilities between states, estimated using both literature and empirical data. The study utilized a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to model the natural history of each simulated patient over a seven-year period from 2019 to 2025. The simulation was repeated 100 times to estimate the variance in outcome variables. The study found that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns caused a significant increase in breast cancer costs, with an average rise of 172.5 million PLN (95% CI [82.4, 262.6]) and an additional 1005 breast cancer deaths (95% CI [426, 1584]) in Poland during the simulated period. While these results are preliminary, they highlight the potential harmful impact of lockdowns on breast cancer treatment outcomes and costs.}

	abstract = {Development of a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) causes a sharp decline in a patient’s health and quality of life. The process of risk stratification is crucial for informing the care that a patient should receive to help manage their Diabetes before an ulcer can form. In existing practice, risk stratification is a manual process where a clinician allocates a risk category based on biomarker features captured during routine appointments. We present the preliminary outcomes of a feasibility study on machine learning techniques for risk stratification of DFU formation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering patient history, and allow us to identify biomarkers which are important for risk classification.}

	abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men in Western societies. Predicting patients’ survival using clinical descriptors is important for stratification in the risk classes and selecting appropriate treatment. Current work is devoted to developing a robust Machine Learning (ML) protocol for predicting the survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In particular, we aimed to identify relevant factors for survival at various time horizons. To this end, we built ML models for eight different predictive horizons, starting at three and up to forty-eight months. The model building involved the identification of informative variables with the help of the MultiDimensional Feature Selection (MDFS) algorithm, entire modelling procedure was performed in multiple repeats of cross-validation. We evaluated the application of 5 popular classification algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, logistic regression, k-NN and naive Bayes, for this task. Best modelling results for all time horizons were obtained with the help of Random Forest. Good prediction results and stable feature selection were obtained for six horizons, excluding the shortest and longest ones. The informative variables differ significantly for different predictive time horizons. Different factors affect survival rates over different periods, however, four clinical variables: ALP, LDH, HB and PSA, were relevant for all stable predictive horizons. The modelling procedure that involves computationally intensive multiple repeats of cross-validated modelling, allows for robust prediction of the relevant features and for much-improved estimation of uncertainty of results.}

	abstract = {Rare autoimmune diseases provoke immune system malfunctioning, which reacts and damages the body’s cells and tissues. They have a low prevalence, classified as complex and multifactorial, with a difficult diagnosis. In this sense, this work aims to support the diagnosis of a rare autoimmune disease using the analysis of medical records from supervised machine learning methods and to identify the models with the best performance considering the characteristics of the available data set. A synthetic database was created with 1000 samples from epidemiological studies identified in the literature, simulating demographic data and symptoms from patient records for the diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH). Data were segmented into training (80%) and test (20%), assigning the diagnosis as the class to be predicted. The models with the highest accuracy were Logistic Regression (84%), Naive-Bayes (82.5%), and Support Vector Machine (79%). Only LR obtained quality values greater than 0.8 in all metrics. SLE had the highest precision and recall for all classifiers, while ALS had the worst results. The LR accuracy model had the best performance with good quality metrics, although it was impossible to predict ALS accurately. Although a real dataset was not used, this work presents a promising approach to support the challenging diagnosis of rare autoimmune diseases.}

	abstract = {Dysgraphia is a learning disability of written expression, which affects the ability to write, mainly handwriting and coherence. Several studies have proposed approaches for assisting dysgraphic people based on AI algorithms. However, existing aids for dysgraphia take only one aspect of the problem faced by the patients into consideration. Indeed, while some provide writing assistance, others address spelling or grammatical problems. In this paper, a novel system for helping people suffering from dysgraphia is proposed. Our system tackles several problems, such as spelling mistakes, grammatical mistakes and poor handwriting quality. Further, a text-to-speech functionality is added to improve the results. The proposed system combines a plethora of solutions into a valuable approach for efficient handwriting correction: handwritten text recognition using a CNN-RNN-CTC model, a spelling correction model based on the SymSpell and Phoneme models, and a grammar correction using the GECToR model. Three machine learning models are proposed. The experimental results are compared based on the values of Character error rate, Word error rate, and the workflow of three handwritten text recognition models, and has led to an improvement of the quality of the results.}

	abstract = {In this article, we present a processing pattern dedicated to video-oculography. It is a complete solution that allows for checking the external conditions accompanying the video oculography, conducting oculometric measurements based on different test models, estimating eye movement (EM) angles and detecting EM type in the stream of coordinates, and calculating its parameters. We based our architecture on neural networks (NN), machine-learning (ML) algorithms of different types, parallel/asynchronous computing, and compilations of the models, to achieve real-time processing in oculometric tests. Oculometric tests provide significant insight into central neuro-motor states, but machine-learning methods are needed to estimate their meaning. A limitation of this cognitive-analytical trend was the reliance on dedicated measuring devices, such as eye-trackers, which are usually separate and expensive equipment. Presented approach goes beyond these limitations and was developed to use standard home computer equipment, with an internet connection and computer camera. Our set of dedicated algorithms embedded in the software compensates for hardware limitations. We tested the results of the presented solution on reflexive saccades (RS) and a standard 30 frames per second (FPS) web-camera, and we were able to distinguish between young and old persons and between healthy and prodromal neurodegenerative (ND) subjects by analyzing RS parameters. Visual processes are connected to many brain structures and, by using ML methods, we are trying to dissect them. The development of solutions like the one presented in this article gives hope for the general availability of screening tests connected to ND risk and for collecting extensive data outside the laboratory. We hope that this direction will contribute to the development of ND analytic means in computational health and consequently, to the faster development of new ND preventive measures.\n}

	abstract = {The incredible advances in machine learning have created a variety of predictive and decision-making medical models that greatly improve the efficacy of treatment and improve the quality of care. In healthcare, such models are often based on electronic health records (EHRs). The quality of this models depends on the quality of the EHRs, which are usually presented as plain unstructured text. Such records often contain spelling errors, which reduce the quality of intelligent systems based on them. In this paper we present a method and tool for correcting spelling errors in medical texts in Russian. By combining the Symmetrical Deletion algorithm and a finely tuned BERT model to correct spelling errors, the tool can improve the quality of original medical texts without significant cost. We have evaluated the correction precision and performance of the presented tool and compared it with other popular spelling error correction tools that support Russian language. Experiments have shown that the presented approach and tool are 7% superior to existing open-source tools for automatically correcting spelling errors in Russian medical texts. The proposed tool and its source code are available on GitHub\\(^{1}\\) and pip\\(^{2}\\) repositories(\\(^1\\)https://github.com/DmitryPogrebnoy/MedSpellChecker \\(^{2}\\)https://pypi.org/project/medspellchecker).}

	abstract = {A growing and renewed interest has emerged in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a source of information for decision-making in clinical practice. In this context, the automatic de-identification of EHRs constitutes an essential task, since their dissociation from personal data is a mandatory first step before their distribution. However, the majority of previous studies on this subject have been conducted on English EHRs, due to the limited availability of annotated corpora in other languages, such as Spanish. In this study, we addressed the automatic de-identification of medical documents in Spanish. A private corpus of 599 real-world clinical cases have been annotated with 8 different protected health information categories. We have tackled the predictive problem as a named entity recognition task, developing two different deep learning-based methodologies, namely a first strategy based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and an end-to-end approach based on transformers. Additionally, we have developed a data augmentation procedure to increase the number of texts used to train the models. The results obtained show that transformers outperform RNN on the de-identification of Spanish clinical data. In particular, the best performance was obtained by the XLM-RoBERTa large transformer, with a strict-match micro-averaged value of 0.946 for precision, 0.954 for recall and 0.95 for F1-score, when trained on the augmented version of the corpus. The performance achieved by transformers in this study proves the viability of applying these state-of-the-art models in real-world clinical scenarios.}

	abstract = {Process Mining typically requires event logs where each event is labelled with a process activity. That’s not always the case, as many process-aware information systems store process-related information in the form of text notes. An example are patient information systems (PIS), which store much information in the form of free-text patient notes. Labelling text-based events with their activity is not trivial, because of the amount of data involved, but also because the activity represented by a text note can be ambiguous. Depending on the requirements of a process analyst, we might need to label events with more or fewer unique activities: two similar events could represent the same activity (e.g. screen referral) or two different activities (e.g. screen adult ADHD referral and screen depression referral). We can therefore view activities as ontologies with an arbitrary number of entries. This paper proposes a method that produces an ontology for the activities of a process by analysing a text-based event log. We implemented an interactive tool that generates process models based on this ontology and the text-based event log. We demonstrate the proposed method’s usefulness by discovering a mental health referral process model from real-world data.}

	abstract = {In recent years, data is continuously evolving not only in volume but also in types and sources, which makes the multidimensional analysis and decision making using traditional approaches a complex and difficult task. In this paper, we propose a three-layer-based architecture to perform multidimensional analysis of natural language queries on health data: 1/ Treatment layer aiming at xR2RML mappings generation and knowledge hypergraph building; 2/ Storage layer allowing mainly to store the RDF triples returned by the query of NoSQL databases, and 3/ Semantic layer, based on a domain ontology which constitutes the knowledge base for the generation of the mappings and the building of the knowledge hypergraph. The originality of our proposal lies in the knowledge hypergraph and its capacity to support multidimensional queries. A prototype is developed and the experiments have shown the relevance of the returned multidimensional query results as well as an improvement over traditional approaches.}

	abstract = {Finite element (FE) simulation is an established approach to mechanical simulation of angioplasty and stent deployment. Agent-based (AB) models are an alternative approach to biological tissue modeling in which individual cells can be represented as agents and are suitable for studying biological responses. By combining these two approaches, it is possible to leverage the strengths of each to improve the in silico description of angioplasty or stenting and the following healing response. Here we propose a couping between FE and AB vascular tissue models using trilinear interpolation, where the stresses (and strains) in the AB model arise directly from the forces of interaction between individual agents. The stress values for FE and AB models are calculated and compared.}

	abstract = {During the last years, a wide variety of epidemic models was employed to analyze the spread of COVID-19. Finding the most suitable model according to the available epidemic data is an important task to consider. In this project, we perform a comparison of several models of COVID-19 dynamics and analyze the dependence of their accuracy on their structural complexity, using COVID-19 incidence data for St. Petersburg. The assessment is based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). The results of the study contribute to understanding how to properly choose the complexity of an explanatory model for a given epidemic dataset.}

	abstract = {The processes of neurodegeneration related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin several decades before the first symptoms. We have used multi-granular computing (MGC) to classify cognitive data from BIOCARD study that have been started over 20\xa0years ago with 354 normal subjects. Patients were evaluated every year by a team of neuropsychologists and neurologists and classified as normal, with MCI (mild cognitive impairments), or with dementia. As the decision attribute, we have used CDRSUM (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes) as a more quantitative measure than the above classification. Based on 150 stable subjects with different stages of AD, and on the group of 40 AD, we have found sets of different granules that classify cognitive attributes with CDRSUM as the disease stage. By applying these rules to normal (CDRSUM\u2009=\u20090) 21 subjects we have predicted that one subject might get mild dementia (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20094.5), one very mild dementia (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20092.25), four might get very mild dementia or questionable impairment and one other might get questionable impairment (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20090.75). AI methods can find, invisible for neuropsychologists, patterns in cognitive attributes of normal subjects that might indicate their pre-dementia stage, also in longitudinal testing.}

	abstract = {Epidemics of acute respiratory infections, such as influenza and COVID-19, pose a serious threat to public health. To control the spread of infections, statistical methods and mathematical models are often used to estimate and forecast epidemic indicators. The assessment of values of these indicators might be impacted by the uncertainty in the initial data used for model calibration. The dependence of modeling results on accuracy of the data can be huge, and the lack of its consideration, which is typical for most works on modeling the spread of epidemic ARIs, makes it difficult to correctly predict the effectiveness of anti-epidemic measures. In this research, we present methods and algorithms for uncertainty estimation in retrospective analysis and forecasting of the incidence of epidemic ARIs. The uncertainty assessment is performed by replicating simulated incidence curves with assumed random errors which distribution is defined by the variance of the original incidence dataset. The application of the methods is demonstrated on an example, with influenza outbreak in St. Petersburg, Russia, as a case study.}

	abstract = {The use of health data in research is fundamental to improve health care, health systems and public health policies. However, due to its intrinsic data sensitivity, there are privacy and security concerns that must be addressed to comply with best practices recommendations and the legal framework. Decentralized-learning methods allow the training of algorithms across multiple locations without data sharing. The application of those methods to the medical field holds great potential due to the guarantee of data privacy compliance. In this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis to explore the intellectual structure of this new research field and to assess its publication and collaboration patterns. A total of 3023 unique documents published between 2013 and 2023 were retrieved from Scopus, from which 488 were included in this review. The most frequent publication source was the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (n\u2009=\u200927). China was the country with the highest number of publications, followed by the USA. The top three authors were Dekker A (n\u2009=\u200914), Wang X (n\u2009=\u200913), Li X (n\u2009=\u200912). The most frequent keywords were “Federated learning” (n\u2009=\u2009218), “Deep learning” (n\u2009=\u200962) and “Machine learning” (n\u2009=\u200952). This study provides an overall picture of the research literature regarding the application of decentralized-learning in healthcare, possibly setting ground for future collaborations.}

	abstract = {The mechano-chemical process of clot formation is relevant in both hemostasis and thrombosis. The initial phase of thrombus formation in arterial thrombosis can be described by the mechanical process of platelet adhesion and aggregation via hemodynamic interactions with von Willebrand factor molecules. Understanding the formation and composition of this initial blood clot is crucial to evaluate differentiating factors between hemostasis and thrombosis. In this work a cell-based platelet adhesion and aggregation model is presented to study the initial steps of aggregate formation. Its implementation upon the pre-existing cellular blood flow model HemoCell is explained in detail and the model is tested in a simple case study of initial aggregate formation under arterial flow conditions. The model is based on a simplified constraint-dependent platelet binding process that coarse-grains the most influential processes into a reduced number of probabilistic thresholds. In contrast to existing computational platelet binding models, the present method places the focus on the mechanical environment that enables the formation of the initial aggregate. Recent studies highlighted the importance of elongational flows on von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation. The cell-resolved scale used for this model allows to account for important hemodynamic phenomena such as the formation of a red blood cell free layer and platelet margination. This work focuses on the implementation details of the model and presents its characteristic behavior at various coarse-grained threshold values.}

Most of the current routines that are used to estimate such parameters leverage state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to identify the global minimum, ignoring the relevance of the potential local minima. In this paper, we present a novel Evolutionary Strategy routine that uses sampling tools deriving from the Bayesian field to find the best parameters according to a certain loss function. The Bayesian Recursive Global Optimizer (BaRGO) presented in this work explores the parameter space identifying both local and global minima.

	abstract = {\nClonal proliferation dynamics within a tumor channels the course of tumor growth, drug response and activity. A high-throughput image screening technique is required to analyze and quantify the spatiotemporal variations in cell proliferation and influence of chemotherapy on clonal colonies. We present two protocols for generating spatial, Lentiviral Gene Ontology (LeGO) fluorescent tag based, mono- and co-culture systems with provisions for spatio-temporal tracking of clonal growth at the nucleus- and cytoplasm-level. The cultured cells are subjected to either drug treatment or co-cultured with fibroblasts and analyzed with a novel image processing framework. This framework enables alignment of cell positions based on motion capture techniques, tracking through time and investigation of drug actions or co-culturing on individual cell colonies. Finally, utilizing this framework, we develop agent-based models to simulate and predict the effects of the microenvironment and clonal density on cell proliferation. The model and experimental findings suggest growth stimulating effects of local clonal density irrespective of overall cell confluency.}

	abstract = {Design of modern antenna systems heavily relies on numerical optimization methods. Their primary purpose is performance improvement by tuning of geometry and material parameters of the antenna under study. For reliability, the process has to be conducted using full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, which are associated with sizable computational expenditures. The problem is aggravated in the case of global optimization, typically carried out using nature-inspired algorithms. To reduce the CPU cost, population-based routines are often combined with surrogate modeling techniques, frequently in the form of machine learning procedures. While offering certain advantages, their efficiency is worsened by the curse of dimensionality and antenna response nonlinearity. In this article, we investigate computational advantages of combining population-based optimization with variable-resolution EM models. Consequently, a model management scheme is developed, which adjusts the discretization level of the antenna under optimization within the continuous spectrum of acceptable fidelities. Starting from the lowest practically useful fidelity, the resolution converges to the highest assumed level when the search process is close to conclusion. Several adjustment profiles are considered to investigate the speedup-reliability trade-offs. Numerical results have been obtained for two microstrip antennas and particle swarm optimizer as a widely-used nature-inspired algorithm. Consistent acceleration of up to eighty percent has been obtained in comparison to the single-resolution version with minor deterioration of the design quality. Another attractive feature of our methodology is versatility and easy implementation and handling.}

	abstract = {\nLoad imbalance is a critical problem that degrades the performance of parallelized applications in massively parallel processing. Although an MPI/OpenMP implementation is widely used for parallelization, users must maintain load balancing at the process level and thread (core) level for effective parallelization. In this paper, we propose dynamic core binding (DCB) to processes for reducing the computation time and energy consumption of applications. Using the DCB approach, an unequal number of cores is bound to each process, and load imbalance among processes is mitigated at the core level. This approach is not only improving parallel performance but also reducing power consumption by reducing the number of using cores without increasing the computational time. Although load balancing among nodes cannot be handled by DCB, we also examine how to solve this problem by mapping processes to nodes. In our numerical evaluations, we implemented a DCB library and applied it to the lattice \\(\\mathcal {H}\\)-matrixes. Based on the numerical evaluations, we achieved a 58% performance improvement and 77% energy consumption reduction for the applications using the lattice \\(\\mathcal {H}\\)-matrix.}

	abstract = {A new surrogate-assisted, pruned dynamic programming-based optimal path search algorithm—studied in the context of ship weather routing—is shown to be both effective and (energy) efficient. The key elements in achieving this—the fast and accurate physics-based surrogate model, the pruned simulation, and the OpenCL-based spmd-parallelisation of the algorithm—are presented in detail. The included results show the high accuracy of the surrogate model (relative approximation error medians smaller than \\(0.2\\%\\)), its efficacy in terms of computing time reduction resulting from pruning (from 43 to 60 times), and the notable speedup of the parallel algorithm (up to 9.4). Combining these effects gives up to 565 times faster execution. The proposed approach can also be applied to other domains. It can be considered as a dynamic programming based, optimal path planning framework parameterised by a problem specific (potentially variable-fidelity) cost-function evaluator.}

Kernels that do not actively take part in a computation can be executed asynchronously in the background, in the aim to saturate the GPU threads. We optimized this asynchronous execution by using mixed precision for such kernels. Implemented on the FaSTAR solver and tested on the NASA CRM case, asynchronous execution gave a speedup of 15% to 27% for a maximum memory overhead of 4.5% to 9%.}

	abstract = {Aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) involves computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based search for an optimal aerodynamic shape such as airfoils and wings. Gradient-based optimization (GBO) with adjoints can be used efficiently to solve ASO problems with many design variables, but problems with many constraints can still be challenging. The recently created efficient global optimization algorithm with neural network (NN)-based prediction and uncertainty (EGONN) partially alleviates this challenge. A unique feature of EGONN is its ability to sequentially sample the design space and continuously update the NN prediction using an uncertainty model based on NNs. This work proposes a novel extension to EGONN that enables efficient handling of nonlinear constraints and a continuous update of the prediction and prediction uncertainty data sets. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on constrained airfoil shape optimization in transonic flow and compared against state-of-the-art GBO with adjoints. The results show that the proposed constrained EGONN algorithm yields comparable optimal designs as GBO at a similar computational cost.}

	abstract = {The problem of fitting a given ordered sample of data points in arbitrary Euclidean space is addressed. The corresponding interpolation knots remain unknown and as such must be first somehow found. The latter leads to a highly non-linear multivariate optimization task, equally non-trivial for theoretical analysis and for derivation of a computationally efficient numerical scheme. The non-degenerate case of at least four data points can be handled by Leap-Frog algorithm merging generic and non-generic univariate overlapping optimizations. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the unimodality for both cases of Leap-Frog optimization tasks are already established in the previous research. This work complements the latter by analyzing the degenerate situation i.e. the case of fitting three data points, for which Leap-Frog cannot be used. It is proved here that the related univariate cost function is always unimodal yielding a global minimum assigned to the missing internal-point knot (with no loss both terminal knots can be assumed to be fixed). Illustrative examples supplement the analysis in question.}

	abstract = {This paper is a study of an application-based model in profit-maximizing multi-vehicle pickup and delivery selection problem (PPDSP). The graph-theoretic model proposed by existing studies of PPDSP is based on transport requests to define the corresponding nodes (i.e., each request corresponds to a pickup node and a delivery node). In practice, however, there are probably multiple requests coming from or going to an identical location. Considering the road networks with the integratable nodes as above, we define a new model based on the integrated nodes for the corresponding PPDSP and propose a novel mixed-integer formulation. In comparative experiments with the existing formulation, as the number of integratable nodes increases, our method has a clear advantage in terms of the number of variables as well as the number of constraints in the generated instances, and the accuracy of the optimized solution obtained within a given time.}

	abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of the exoplanetary system TRAPPIST with seven bodies of variable mass moving around a central parent star along quasi-elliptic orbits is discussed. The bodies are assumed to be spherically symmetric and attract each other according to Newton’s law of gravitation. In this case, the leading factor of dynamic evolution of the system is the variability of the masses of all bodies. The problem is analyzed in the framework of Hamiltonian’s formalism and the differential equations of motion of the bodies are derived in terms of the osculating elements of aperiodic motion on quasi-conic sections. These equations can be solved numerically but their right-hand sides contain many oscillating terms and so it is very difficult to obtain their solutions over long time intervals with necessary precision. To simplify calculations and to analyze the behavior of orbital parameters over long time intervals we replace the perturbing functions by their secular parts and obtain a system of the evolutionary equations composed by 28 non-autonomous linear differential equations of the first order. Choosing some realistic laws of mass variations and physics parameters corresponding to the exoplanetary system TRAPPIST, we found numerical solutions of the evolutionary equations. All the relevant symbolic and numeric calculations are performed with the aid of the computer algebra system Wolfram Mathematica.}

	abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AutoDiff) in machine learning is largely restricted to expressions used for neural networks (NN), with the depth rarely exceeding a few tens of layers. Compared to NN, numerical simulations typically involve iterative algorithms like time steppers that lead to millions of iterations. Even for modest-sized models, this may yield infeasible memory requirements when applying the adjoint method, also called backpropagation, to time-dependent problems. In this situation, checkpointing algorithms provide a trade-off between recomputation and storage. This paper presents the package Checkpointing.jl\xa0that leverages expression transformations in the programming language Julia and the package ChainRules.jl to automatically and transparently transform loop iterations into differentiated loops. The user may choose between various checkpointing algorithm schemes and storage devices. We describe the unique design of Checkpointing.jl\xa0and demonstrate its features on an automatically differentiated MPI implementation of Burgers’ equation on the Polaris cluster at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.}

We tested 19 MA optimizers measuring their performance directly on sample datasets. The impact of input parameters such as number of hidden layer units, optimization stopping conditions and population size on the accuracy results, training and prediction time is evaluated here. Significant differences in performance of applied methods and their parameters’ values are detected. The most meaningful outcome of this paper shows that an increase of the number of MA iterations does not yield significant boost in accuracy with a huge increase in training time. Indeed a cap on number of MA iterations ranging from 1 to 5 is sufficient for analyzed machine learning tasks. In our research the best results are obtained for population size ranging between 50 and 100. Hybridized ELM outperforms classical implementation of ELM as higher accuracy is reached for the same number of neurons.}

	abstract = {Supply chain management is a critical success factor for many manufacturing companies. During the pandemic period, the problem of meeting delivery on time according to customer needs has intensified in many companies around the world. Companies would like to keep inventories at a level that ensures smooth order fulfilment while minimising their own costs. Determining the optimal parameters is, however, a major challenge for Supply Chain inventory policy (SC). Combining simulation methods with optimisation techniques offers a methodology for obtaining an acceptable solution and, at the same time, provides a high degree of flexibility in the formulation of assumptions and the possibility of improving the decision-making process with respect to risk management. In this paper we present a simulation-based optimisation model to improve the quality of inventory management decisions in SC design and planning. Finally, we refer to the benefits of implementing the model in the concept of digital twins.}

	abstract = {Mixed integer programming (MIP) is an extremely versatile subclass of mathematical optimization problems. Applications of MIP are ubiquitous in our world today, ranging from scheduling to network design to production planning. The standard approach in state-of-the-art commercial solvers is called branch-and-cut. The selection of these cuts is an integral part of the branch-and-cut process as high-quality cuts can greatly increase solving efficiency. Currently, cut selection is decided by heuristics that both require expert knowledge and lack generalizability. In this paper, we propose an efficient and highly generalizable cut selection scheme based on semi-supervised learning. First, we design a cut evaluation metric that labels cuts based on whether they are efficient or not. Then, we train a deep learning classification model with unsupervised pre-training as a ranking function for cuts. In our evaluation, the proposed model outperforms standard heuristics and is comparable to existing machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the model is shown to be generalizable over both problem size and problem class.}

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of an engineered system involves the identification of uncertainties, modeling of the uncertainties, and the forward propagation of the uncertainties through a system analysis model. In this work, a novel surrogate-based forward propagation algorithm for UQ is proposed. The proposed algorithm is a new and unique extension of the recent efficient global optimization using neural network (NN)-based prediction and uncertainty (EGONN) algorithm which was created for optimization. The proposed extended algorithm is specifically created for UQ and is called uqEGONN. The uqEGONN algorithm sequentially and simultaneously samples two NNs, one for the prediction of a nonlinear function and the other for the prediction uncertainty. The uqEGONN algorithm terminates based on the absolute relative changes in the summary statistics based on Monte Carlo simulations (MCS), or a given maximum number of sequential samples. The algorithm is demonstrated on the UQ of the Ishigami function. The results show that the proposed algorithm yields comparable results as MCS on the true function and those results are more accurate than the results obtained using space-filling Latin hypercube sampling to train the NNs.}

	abstract = {The neural network-based approach to solving partial differential equations has attracted considerable attention. In training a neural network, the network learns global features corresponding to low-frequency components while high-frequency components are approximated at a much slower rate. For a class of equations in which the solution contains a wide range of scales, the network training process can suffer from slow convergence and low accuracy due to its inability to capture the high-frequency components. In this work, we propose a sequential training based on a hierarchy of networks to improve the convergence rate and accuracy of the neural network solution to partial differential equations. The proposed method comprises multi-training levels in which a newly introduced neural network is guided to learn the residual of the previous level approximation. We validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed hierarchical approach through a suite of partial differential equations.}

We follow in our approach the classical Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) model where a PNN is composed of several sequential neural networks, which are trained with a proportional share of the training dataset. We used for this purpose the MNIST dataset, which contains binary images of handwritten digits. Our analysis focusses on different activation functions and optimizations in the form of stochastic gradients and initialization of weights and biases. We conduct a thorough performance analysis, where network configurations and different performance factors are analyzed and interpreted. Golang and its inherent parallelization support proved very well for parallel neural network simulation by considerable decreased processing times compared to sequential variants.}

	abstract = {Behavioral modeling has been rising in importance in modern antenna design. It is primarily employed to diminish the computational cost of procedures involving massive full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Cheaper alternative offer surrogate models, yet, setting up data-driven surrogates is impeded by, among others, the curse of dimensionality. This article introduces a novel approach to reduced-cost surrogate modeling of antenna structures, which focuses the modeling process on design space regions containing high-quality designs, identified by randomized pre-screening. A supplementary dimensionality reduction is applied via the spectral analysis of the random observable set. The reduction process identifies the most important directions from the standpoint of geometry parameter correlations, and spans the domain along a small subset thereof. As demonstrated, domain confinement as outlined above permits a dramatic improvement of surrogate accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art modeling approaches.}

	abstract = {Physical field reconstruction from limited real-time data is a topical inverse problem that attracts substantial research effort, and complex geometries present a formidable challenge. The paper describes a reconstruction of the velocity field of a steady fluid flow through a two-dimensional porous structure from the real-time gauge readings (that is, velocity values obtained at specific fixed locations). The dataset is composed of 300 Lattice-Boltzmann simulations of the flow with different boundary conditions. The number of the gauges and their locations are varied. Two reconstruction techniques are applied: neural network (NN) and linear least squares solver. The linear solver outperforms the NN in terms of both speed and precision. Sensor locations are optimized by Monte Carlo method. The porous structure is mapped onto a graph and the optimization is performed by Metropolis type node-to-node trial displacements of the gauges. With 100 gauges, the linear method enables reconstruction of the velocity field in a porous structure discretized on 256\\(\\,\\times \\,\\)256 2D grid with the normalized error of 0.57%.}

This paper presents methods of modeling distortions for measuring system based on one camera that is easy to install in an industrial plant. Those models allow to perform measurement quickly at any position of the pipe on a large industrial measurement table. The paper describes the mathematical models of perspective projections of single- and double- bent pipes, as well as the method of bending angle determination and detection of straight sections of the bent pipe. As part of the research, measurement accuracy of the designed system model were described and confirmed.}

The methodology reduces the search space of the fit parameters by exploring a database that contains stored historical events and their corresponding simulator fit parameters. We carry out the symbolic representation of the time series using ordinal patterns to classify the series, which allows us to search and compare by similarity on the stored data of the series represented. This classification strategy allows us to speed up the parameter search process, reduce the computational cost of the adjustment process and consequently improve energy cost savings. The experiences showed a reduction in the computational cost of 29% compared with our tuning methodology proposed in previous research.}

While most existing partitioning algorithms focus on minimizing cut size, the main issue is not to map long paths across multiple FPGAs, as it may cause an increase in critical path length. To address this problem, we propose a new hypergraph model, for which we design algorithms for initial partitioning and partition refinement. We integrate these algorithm in a multilevel framework, combined with existing min-cut solvers, to tackle simultaneously both path length and cut size objectives. We observe a significant reduction in critical path degradation, by 12%–40%, at the cost of a moderate increase in cut size, compared to path-agnostic min-cut methods.}

	abstract = {Detection of incorrectly conducted failure repairs is not a trivial task for companies manufacturing big volumes of goods. Extensive data sets of service calls are periodically updated and subject matters experts would not be efficient in manual annotating of the data. Symptoms described in free text form might be caused by different components - not necessarily by the most obvious. Classes are imbalanced due to different time to failure of particular components and thus actions taken for some rare failures might be noted as incorrect ones. The presented problem is similar to the problem of learning in a presence of noisy labels, which are caused by human errors, variation of annotator to annotator perception, faults made by annotating algorithms or by other reasons. There are multiple techniques to prevent neural networks from overfitting to the noisy data, but to our best knowledge none of them considers relationships between classes, which is crucial in engineering systems built from multiple components connected in a specific way. A novel approach of selecting clean data samples in an unsupervised manner is presented in this paper. It is based on a topological approach exploring the deep representation of the features in the hidden space, enriched with knowledge graphs reflecting the structure of the classes. We present the case study of the algorithm utilized for service calls data set for home appliances.}

	abstract = {Science collaborations use computer grids to run expensive computational tasks on large data sets. Tasks as jobs across the network demand data and thereby workload management and data allocation to maintain the computational workflow. Data allocation includes data placement with different replication factors (multiplicity) of data. The proposed data replication & allocation model can place multitudes of subsets of a data population in a distributed system, such as a computer cluster or computer grid. A stochastic simulation with a data and computing example from the ATLAS Physics Collaboration shows its potential usability in one of the largest Computing Grids. This paper showcases data allocation with different replica factors and various numbers of subsets to improve the overall situation in a computer network.}

	abstract = {Leading Point Multi-Regression Model was utilized to detect days with abnormal energy consumption profiles. They were identified based on the statistical analysis of relative errors of the model. Two ranges of error values were identified: above 4.98% and 3.88%–4.98%. All days with anomalous energy consumption profiles were identified as major religious holidays in Poland: Easter, All Saints, and Christmas Eve, as well as days related to a celebration of the new year: New Year’s Eve and New Year.}
