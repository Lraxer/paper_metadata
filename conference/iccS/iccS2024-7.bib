	abstract = {Capillary behaviors of two phases in porous media are widely investigated by pore-scale simulations. Flow properties of miscible two-phase fluids pose challenges because compositional species in miscible fluids exist in both of two phases. In this work, pore-network modeling is developed to analyze capillary behaviors of miscible fluids. First, the pore-network structure is generated by introducing the Halton sequence and the Delaunay triangulation. Then, we perform the primary drainage to simulate the variation of capillary pressure as a function of saturation under equilibrium conditions. The miscibility details of two-phase fluids are determined by two-phase flash calculations. The effect of representative network sizes on capillary behaviors is analyzed to balance computational demands and interpretability. Our models demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of the network generation procedure. Finally, our simulation results indicate that the miscibility of fluids significantly influences capillary behaviors, highlighting the necessity of species-specific compositional modeling for miscible two-phase fluids in porous media.}

	abstract = {For the Stokes problem with pressure Dirichlet boundary conditions, we propose an Enriched Mini element. For both the Mini element and the Enriched Mini element, we show that they are inf-sup stable. Unexpectedly, they yield wrong convergent finite element solutions for the singular velocity solution. On the contrary, the Taylor-Hood element, which is still inf-sup stable, gives correct convergence. However, how to analyze the convergence becomes open. We provide extensive numerical studies on the wrong convergence of the inf-sup stable Mini-type elements and the correct convergence of the inf-sup stable Taylor-Hood element and on the inf-sup stability constants.\n}

Transport equations are discretized by the finite volume method on 3D collocated unstructured meshes. The central difference scheme discretizes the diffusive term. Gradients are evaluated by the weighted least-squares method. The fractional-step projection method solves the pressure-velocity coupling in momentum equations.

	abstract = {Convection-diffusion problems in highly convective flows can exhibit complicated features such as sharp shocks and shear layers which involve steep gradients in their solutions. As a consequence, developing an efficient computational solver to capture these flow features requires the adjustment of the local scale difference between convection and diffusion terms in the governing equations. In this study, we propose a monotonicity preserving backward characteristics scheme combined with a second-order BDF2-Petrov-Galerkin finite volume method to deal with the multiphysics nature of the problem. Unlike the conventional Eulerian techniques, the two-step backward differentiation procedure is applied along the characteristic curves to obtain a second-order accuracy. Numerical results are presented for several benchmark problems including sediment transport in coastal areas. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the new algorithm to accurately maintain the shape of the computed solutions in the presence of sharp gradients and shocks.}

	abstract = {The stability of the initial platelet aggregates is relevant in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Understanding the structural stresses of such aggregates under different flow conditions is crucial to gaining insight into the role of platelet activation and binding in the more complex process of clot formation. In this work, a three-dimensional implicit partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is presented to study the deformation and structural stress of platelet aggregates in specific blood flow environments. Platelet aggregates are considered as porous mediums in the model. The FSI model couples a fluid solver based on Navier-Stokes equations and a porosity-dependent compressible neo-Hookean material to capture the mechanical characteristics of the platelet aggregates. A parametric study is performed to explore the influence of porosity and applied body force on this material. Based on in vitro experimental data, the deformation and associated stress of a low shear aggregate and a high shear aggregate under different flow conditions are evaluated. This FSI framework offers a way to elucidate the complex interaction between blood flow and platelet aggregates and is applicable to a wider range of porous biomaterials in flow.}

	abstract = {The Generalized Hydrodynamic Equations are being investigated for simulating turbulent flows. They were derived from the Generalized Boltzmann Equation by Alexeev (1994), which itself was obtained from first principles via a chain of Bogolubov kinetic equations and considers particles of finite dimensions. Compared to the Navier-Stokes equations, the Generalized Hydrodynamic Equations include new terms representing temporal and spatial fluctuations. These terms introduce a timescale multiplier denoted by \\(\\tau \\), and the Generalized Hydrodynamic Equations reduce to the Navier-Stokes equations when \\(\\tau \\) equals zero. The nondimensional \\(\\tau \\) is calculated as the product of the Reynolds number and the squared ratio of length scales, \\(\\tau = Re \\times (l/L)^2\\), where l represents the apparent Kolmogorov length scale and L denotes a hydrodynamic length scale. In this study, 2D turbulent flow over a Backward-Facing Step (BFS) with a step height of H\xa0=\xa0L/3 (where L is the channel height) at Reynolds number Re = 132000 was investigated using finite-element solutions of the GHE. The results were compared to Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) utilizing the Navier-Stokes equations, and to a \\(k-\\varepsilon \\) turbulence model, as well as experimental data. The comparison encompassed velocity profiles, recirculation zone length, and the velocity flow field. The obtained data confirm that the GHE results are in good agreement with the experimental findings, while other approaches diverge significantly from the experimental data.}

	abstract = {Wearing a face mask is widely acknowledged as a critical defense against the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and influenza. This research focuses on the deformation of face masks during a cough and uses fluid dynamics simulations to more precisely predict the trajectory of virus-laden droplets. By employing motion capture technology, we measured the mask's displacement, which reaches up to 6\xa0mm during a cough. Moreover, this paper delves into how the mask's deformation influences the movement of these droplets. We created a model for a small, spherical droplet and analyzed its dispersion by solving its motion equation, factoring in the cough's flow rate, droplet size distribution, and evaporation, all while considering the mask's deformation. Our findings reveal that mask deformation leads to a 7% reduction in average flow velocity compared to analyses using a non-deforming mask. Additionally, the distance droplets disperse increases over time when mask deformation is considered. As a practical application, we analyzed droplet dispersion in a scenario where a wheelchair is being pushed, utilizing airflow data that accounts for mask deformation. This analysis indicated that pushing a wheelchair at a speed of 0.5\xa0m/s significantly raises the infection risk for individuals behind it.}

Cross-validation to assess its performance is conducted with OpenFOAM-based solvers, specifically rhoCentralFoam and QGDFoam.

	abstract = {Deep neural network models are commonly used in computer vision problems, e.g., image segmentation. Convolutional neural networks have been state-of-the-art methods in image processing, but new architectures, such as Transformer-based approaches, have started outperforming previous techniques in many applications. However, those techniques are still not commonly used in urban analyses, mostly performed manually. This paper presents a framework for the residential building semantic segmentation architecture as a tool for automatic urban phenomena monitoring. The method could improve urban decision-making processes with automatic city analysis, which is predisposed to be faster and even more accurate than those made by human researchers. The study compares the application of new deep network architectures with state-of-the-art solutions. The analysed problem is urban functional zone segmentation for the urban sprawl evaluation using targeted land cover map construction. The proposed method monitors the expansion of the city, which, uncontrolled, can cause adverse effects. The method was tested on photos from three residential districts. The first district has been manually segmented by functional zones and used for model training and evaluation. The other two districts have been used for automated segmentation by models’ inference to test the robustness of the methodology. The test resulted in 98.2% accuracy.}

	abstract = {Travel mode choice models make it possible to learn under what conditions people decide to use different means of transport. Typically, such models are based on real trip records provided by respondents, e.g. city inhabitants. However, the question arises of how to scale the insights from an inevitably limited number of trips described in their travel diaries to entire cities. To address the limited availability of real trip records, we propose the Urban Journey System integrating big data platforms, analytic engines, and synthetic data generators for urban transport analysis. First of all, the system makes it possible to generate random synthetic journeys linking origin and destination pairs by producing location pairs using an input probability distribution. For each synthetic journey, the system calculates candidate routes for different travel modes (car, public transport (PT), cycling, and walking). Next, the system calculates Level of Service (LOS) attributes such as travel duration, waiting time and distances involved, assuming both planned and real behaviour of the transport system. This allows us to compare travel parameters for planned and real transits. We validate the system with spatial, schedule and GPS data from the City of Warsaw. We analyse LOS attributes and underlying vehicle trajectories over time to estimate spatio-temporal distributions of features such as travel duration, and number of transfers. We extend this analysis by referring to the travel mode choice model developed for the city.}

	abstract = {The application of Internet of Things technology in the agricultural sector has allowed to achieve a significant improvement in the process of growing and harvesting products. This has been possible since it allows obtaining a more exact control of the information in real time, thus allowing better decision-making in crop management and thereby improving their quality. Faced with this situation, this paper proposes the design and implementation of a soil moisture monitoring system for a strawberry crop using LoRaWAN technology to allow the farmer to improve the production of their crops, while maintaining low technological implementation costs. The system allows the visualization of the data in real time through a web application, which are obtained from the sensors installed in the ground and which are transmitted through the LoRaWAN network. Once the system was developed using different trending technological tools, its functionality could be verified with satisfactory results. The functionality of the application obtained an acceptance of 94% and an usability a score of 86.87, indicating that the system meets the expectations of the users. Additionally, in the coverage tests, it was possible to verify the long communication range of the installed LoRaWAN devices.}

	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role in protecting networks from cyber threats. Currently, intrusion detection methods based on artificial intelligen (AI) stand as the mainstream, yet they grapple with the challenges of interpretability and high computational costs. Conversely, rule-based approaches offer ease of comprehension and lower computational overhead, but their development demands extensive expertise. This paper proposes an intelligent framework for generating intrusion detection rules, which integrates the strong representational capabilities of AI detectors while retaining the advantages of rule-based detection. Initially, the framework involves training a TextCNN model for traffic payload classification. The parameters of this model, along with the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm, are employed to analyze critical fields in captured traffic payloads. Subsequently, a comprehensive list of keywords is obtained through a sensitive words aggregation algorithm, and regular expressions are generated to describe the detection content. These regular expressions undergo fine-tuning to reduce their false positive rate. Furthermore, adhering to the syntax of Suricata rules, they are formulated into intrusion detection rules. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, with experimental results demonstrating commendable detection efficacy for the generated intrusion detection rules.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of AI-based technology, social bot detection is becoming an increasingly challenging task to combat the spread of misinformation and protect the authenticity of online resources. Existing graph-based social bot detection approaches primarily rely on the topological structure of the Twittersphere but often overlook the diverse influence dynamics across different relationships. Moreover, these methods typically aggregate only direct neighbors based on transitive learning, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the nuanced interactions within evolving social Twittersphere. In this paper, we propose BotRGA, a novel Twitter bot detection framework based on inductive representation learning. Our method begins with extracting the semantic features from Twitter user profiles, descriptions, tweets and constructing a heterogeneous graph, where nodes represent users and edges represent relationships. We then propose a relational graph aggregation method to learn node representations by sampling and aggregating the features from both direct and indirect neighbors. Additionally, we evaluate the importance of different relations and fuse the node’s representations across diversified relations with semantic fusion networks. Finally, we classify Twitter users into bots or genuine users and learn model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on two comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that the superior performance of BotRGA compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additional studies also confirm that the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph aggregation, semantic fusion networks, and strong generalization ability to new and previously unseen user communities.}

	abstract = {In the domain of battery energy storage systems for Electric Vehicles (EVs) applications and beyond, the adoption of machine learning techniques has surfaced as a notable strategy for battery modeling. Machine learning models are primarily utilized for forecasting the forthcoming state of batteries, with a specific focus on analyzing the State-of-Charge (SOC). Additionally, these models are employed to assess the State-of-Health (SOH) and predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries. Moreover, offering clear explanations for abnormal battery usage behavior is crucial, empowering users with insights needed for informed decision-making, build trust in the system, and ultimately enhance overall satisfaction. This paper presents SOCXAI, a novel algorithm designed for precise estimation of batteries’s SOC. Our proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to efficiently estimate the twenty five future values of SOC, rather than a single value. We also incorporate a SHApley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based post-hoc explanation method into our method focusing on the current feature values for deeper prediction insights. Furthermore, to detect abnormal battery usage behavior, we employ a 2-dimensional matrix profile-based approach on the time series of current values and their corresponding SHAP values. This methodology facilitates the detection of discords, which indicate irregular patterns in the battery usage. Our extensive empirical evaluation, using diverse real-world benchmarks, demonstrates our approach effectiveness, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of smart manufacturing and the pivotal role of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in enhancing operational efficiency, underscore the necessity for robust anomaly detection mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to detecting anomalies based on AGV telemetry data, leveraging the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze complex data streams and time series signals. By focusing on the unique challenges posed by real-world AGV environments, we propose a methodology that integrates data collection, preprocessing, and the application of specific AI/ML models to accurately identify deviations from normal operations. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on datasets featuring anomalies caused by mechanical wear or excessive friction and issues related to tire and wheel damage, employing LSTM and GRU networks, alongside traditional classifiers like K-nearest neighbors and SVM. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in forecasting momentary power consumption as an indicator of mechanical anomalies, and in classifying wheel-related issues with high accuracy. This work not only contributes to the enhancement of predictive maintenance strategies but also provides valuable insights for the development of more resilient and efficient AGV systems in smart manufacturing environments.}

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR)-based flight simulation reshapes how pilots are trained, offering an immersive environment where commercial and fighter pilots can be trained at low cost with minimal use of fuel and safety concerns. This study conducts a pioneering comparative analysis of marker-based tracking and SLAM technologies within the Microsoft HoloLens 2 platform, mainly focusing on their efficacy in landing manoeuvre simulations. Our investigation incorporates an experimental setup where marker-based tracking overlays interactive video tutorials onto a simulated cockpit, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of landing procedures. The experiment demonstrates that marker-based systems ensure high precision within 5\xa0cm and 15\xa0cm from the HoloLens 2 camera, proving indispensable for procedural training that requires exact overlay precision. Conversely, the native SLAM algorithm, while lacking the same level of precision, offers flexibility and adaptability by accurately mapping the cockpit and superimposing virtual information in dynamic, markerless conditions. The study juxtaposes these technologies, revealing a trade-off between precision and adaptability, and suggests an integrative approach to leverage their respective strengths. Our findings provide pivotal insights for developers and training institutions to optimize AR flight simulation training, contributing to advanced, immersive pilot training programs.}

We call the new dynamic as the rational logit dynamic. The use of the rational logit function implies that the uncertainties have a longer tail than that assumed in the classical one. We show that the rational logit dynamic admits a unique measure-valued solution and the solution can be approximated using a finite difference discretization. We also show that the vanishing-noise limit of the rational logit dynamic exists and is different from the best-response one, demonstrating that influences of the uncertainty tail persist in the rational logit dynamic. We finally apply the rational logit dynamic to a unique fishing competition data that has been recently acquired by the authors.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of classifying objects based on fragmented data, particularly when dealing with characteristics extracted from images captured from various angles. The complexity increases when dealing with fragmented images that may partially overlap. The paper introduces a classification model utilizing neural networks, specifically multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. The key concept involves generating local models based on local tables comprising characteristics extracted from fragmented images. Since the local tables may have different sets of attributes due to varying perspectives, missing attributes in the tables are imputed by introducing artificial objects. The local models, now with identical structures are created and the aggregation of these models into a global model is carried out using weighted averages. The model’s efficacy is evaluated against existing literature methods using various metrics, demonstrating superior performance in terms of F-measure and balanced accuracy. Notably, the paper investigates the impact of the number of generated artificial objects on classification quality, revealing that a higher number generally improves results.}

	abstract = {Clustering in presence of uncertainty may be considered, at the same time, to be a pressing need and a challenge to effectively address many real-world problems. This concise literature review aims to identify and discuss the associated body of knowledge according to a cross-domain perspective. A semi-systematic methodology has allowed the selection of 68 papers, with a priority on the most recent contributions. The analysis has re-marked the relevance of the topic and has made explicit a trend to domain-specific solutions over generic-purpose approaches. On one side, this trend enables a more specific set of solutions within specific communities; on the other side, the resulting distributed approach is not always well-integrated in the mainstream and may generate a further fragmentation of the body of knowledge, mostly because of some lack of abstraction in the definition of specific problems. While these gaps are largely understandable within the research community, a lack of implementations to provide ready-to-use resources is overall critical, looking at a more and more computational and data intensive world.}

	abstract = {The determination of three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars based on the observations collected by a space telescope suffers from the uncertainty of random as well as systematic errors. The systematic errors are introduced by imperfections of the telescope’s optics and detectors as well as in the pointing accuracy of the satellite. The fine art of astrometry consists of heuristically finding the best possible calibration model that will account for and remove these systematic errors. Since this is a process based on trial and error, appropriate software is needed that is efficient enough to solve the system of astrometric equations and reveal the astrometric parameters of stars for the given calibration model within a reasonable time. In this work, we propose a novel architecture and corresponding prototype of a direct solver optimized for running on supercomputers. The main advantages expected of this direct method over an iterative one are the numerical robustness, accuracy of the method, and the explicit calculation of the variance-covariance matrix for the estimation of the accuracy and correlation of the unknown parameters. This solver is supposed to handle astrometric systems with billions of equations within several hours. To reach the desired performance, state-of-the-art libraries for parallel computing are used along with the hand-crafted subroutines optimized for hybrid parallelism model and advanced vector extensions of modern CPUs. The developed solver is tested using the mock science data related to the Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE).}

	abstract = {The numerical solution in sense of Prager&Synge is defined as a hypersphere containing a true solution of a system of partial differentiation equations (PDE). In the original variant Prager&Synge method is based on special orthogonal properties of PDE and may be applied only to several equations. Herein, the Prager&Synge solution (center and radius of the hypersphere) is estimated using the ensemble of numerical solutions obtained by independent algorithms. This approach is not problem dependent and may be applied to arbitrary system of PDE. Several options for computation of the Prager&Synge solution are considered. The first one is based on the search for the orthogonal truncation errors and their transformation. The second is based on the orthogonalization of approximation errors obtained using the defect correction method. It applies the superposition of numerical solutions. The third option uses the width of the ensemble of numerical solutions. The numerical tests for the two dimensional inviscid flows are presented that demonstrate the acceptable effectivity of the approximation error estimates based on the solution in the Prager&Synge sense.}

	abstract = {In recent years, self-supervised learning has played a pivotal role in advancing machine learning by allowing models to acquire meaningful representations from unlabeled data. An intriguing research avenue involves developing self-supervised models within an information-theoretic framework, e.g., feature decorrelation methods like Barlow Twins and VICReg, which can considered as particular implementations of the information bottleneck objective. However, many studies often deviate from the stochasticity assumptions inherent in the information-theoretic framework. Our research demonstrates that by adhering to these assumptions, specifically by employing stochastic embeddings in the form of a parametrized conditional density, we can not only achieve performance comparable to deterministic networks but also significantly improve the detection of out-of-distribution examples, surpassing even the performance of supervised detectors. With VICReg, specifically, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.858 for the stochastic unsupervised detector, compared to 0.796 for the supervised baseline. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved solely by leveraging information from the underlying embedding distribution.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a critical aspect of uncovering unusual patterns in data analysis. This involves distinguishing between normal patterns and abnormal ones, which inherently involves uncertainty. This paper presents an enhanced version of the parallel UC2B framework for anomaly detection, previously introduced in a different context. In this work, we present an extension of the framework and present its large-scale evaluation on the Supercomputer Fugaku. The focus is on assessing its scalability by leveraging a great number of nodes to process large-scale datasets within the cybersecurity domain, using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The ensemble learning techniques and inherent parallelizability of the Unite and Conquer approach are highlighted as key components, contributing to the framework’s computational efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. This study expands upon the framework’s capabilities and emphasizes its potential integration into an existing Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) system for enhancing cyber threat detection and response.}

	abstract = {Organisational routines are repetitive, recognisable patterns of interdependent action by human and digital actors to accomplish tasks. Routine Dynamics is a theoretical base that informs discussion and analysis of such routines. We note that there is a knowledge gap in the literature on organisational routines to consolidate the constructs and ontologies of routines into an abstract data model. In this paper, we design and implement a data model of routines using the Unified Modelling Language. We present a demonstration to illustrate our data model’s use, and how one can then use instantiations of the model to analyse and simulate organisational routines based on real-world data. This example examines recurrent patterns of action inferred from data in the GitHub issue tracking system about the open-source software project, scikit-learn. Our study extends the theoretical/empirical understanding and knowledge base of Routine Dynamics by laying the groundwork towards examining organisational routines from a model-driven perspective that gives rise to simulating the dynamics of routines.}

	abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) education has become essential in recent years, especially that parallel computing on high performance computing systems enables modern machine learning models to grow in scale. This significant increase in the computational power of modern supercomputers relies on a large number of cores in modern CPUs and GPUs. As a consequence, parallel program development based on parallel thinking has become a necessity to fully utilize modern HPC systems’ computational power. Therefore, teaching HPC has become essential in developing skills required by the industry. In this paper we share our experience of conducting a dedicated HPC course, provide a brief description of the course content, and propose a way to conduct HPC laboratory classes, in which a single task is implemented using several APIs, i.e., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, hybrid MPI+Pthreads, and MPI+OpenMP. Based on the actual task of verifying Goldbach’s conjecture for a given range of numbers, we present and analyze the performance evaluation of students’ solutions and code speed-ups for MPI and OpenMP. Additionally, we evaluate students’ subjective assessment of ease of use of particular APIs along with the lengths of codes, and students’ performance over recent years.}

While student evaluations provide valuable feedback, they are limited by students’ inability to accurately assess their own learning. This reliance on student evaluations alone can lead to biased assessments, grade inflation, and misconceptions about learning. To address these issues, a multidimensional approach to teacher evaluation is proposed. This approach incorporates various assessment methods, including on-site evaluations, standardized tests, portfolio reviews, and student surveys, to provide a comprehensive view of a teacher's performance.}

	abstract = {Grade inflation is a complex phenomenon observed predominantly in institutions like the Tecnológico de Monterrey and English-speaking universities, with sporadic instances in certain European regions. Its causes are multifaceted, ranging from competition among universities for prestigious opportunities to shifts in teaching and evaluation methods. Efforts to curb grade inflation, such as limiting grade distribution and publishing course averages, have had mixed success. We carry out both ChatGPT led and traditional bibliographical research to understand its causes, identify successful strategies, and adopt a collaborative, systemic approach that can effectively control grade inflation without compromising teaching standards or exacerbating student stress.}
