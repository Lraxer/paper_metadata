	abstract = {The emergence of blockchain technologies has created the possibility of transforming business processes in the form of immutable agreements called smart contracts. Smart contracts suffer from a major limitation; they cannot authenticate the trustworthiness of real-world data sources, creating the need for intermediaries called oracles. Oracles are trusted entities that connect on-chain systems with off-chain data, allowing smart contracts to operate on real-world inputs in a trustworthy manner. A popular oracle protocol is a crowdsourced oracle, where unrelated individuals attest to facts through voting mechanisms in smart contracts. Crowdsourced oracles have unique challenges: the trustworthiness and correctness of outcomes cannot be explicitly verified. These problems are aggravated by inherent vulnerabilities to attacks, such as Sybil attacks. To address this weakness, this paper proposes a reputation-based mechanism, where oracles are given a reputation value depending on the implied correctness of their actions over time. This reputation score is used to eliminate malicious agents from the participant pool. Additionally, two reputation-based voting mechanisms are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is evaluated using an agent-based simulation of a crowdsourced oracle platform, where a pool of oracles performs evaluate Boolean queries.}

	abstract = {A spreading process can be observed when a particular behavior, substance, or disease spreads through a population over time in social and biological systems. It is widely believed that contact interactions among individual entities play an essential role in the spreading process. Although the contact interactions are often influenced by geometrical conditions, little attention has been paid to understand their effects especially on contact duration among pedestrians. To examine how the pedestrian flow setups affect contact duration distribution, we have analyzed trajectories of pedestrians in contact interactions collected from pedestrian flow experiments of uni-, bi- and multi-directional setups. Based on standardized maximal distance, we have classified types of motions observed in the contact interactions. We have found that almost all motion in the unidirectional flow setup can be characterized as subdiffusive motion, suggesting that the empirically measured contact duration tends to be longer than one estimated by ballistic motion assumption. However, Brownian motion is more frequently observed from other flow setups, indicating that the contact duration estimated by ballistic motion assumption shows good agreement with the empirically measured one. Furthermore, when the difference in relative speed distributions between the experimental data and ballistic motion assumption is larger, more subdiffusive motions are observed. This study also has practical implications. For instance, it highlights that geometrical conditions yielding smaller difference in the relative speed distributions are preferred when diseases can be transmitted through face-to-face interactions.}

	abstract = {Missing data is an issue that can negatively impact any task performed with the available data and it is often found in real-world domains such as healthcare. One of the most common strategies to address this issue is to perform imputation, where the missing values are replaced by estimates. Several approaches based on statistics and machine learning techniques have been proposed for this purpose, including deep learning architectures such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoders. In this work, we propose a novel siamese neural network suitable for missing data imputation, which we call Siamese Autoencoder-based Approach for Imputation (SAEI). Besides having a deep autoencoder architecture, SAEI also has a custom loss function and triplet mining strategy that are tailored for the missing data issue. The proposed SAEI approach is compared to seven state-of-the-art imputation methods in an experimental setup that comprises 14 heterogeneous datasets of the healthcare domain injected with Missing Not At Random values at a rate between 10% and 60%. The results show that SAEI significantly outperforms all the remaining imputation methods for all experimented settings, achieving an average improvement of 35%.}

	abstract = {Tsunamis and earthquakes have a great impact in human lives, infrastructures and economy. Although preventing tsunamis from occurring is impossible, minimizing their negative effects is in our hands. The aim of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) proposed in this paper is to provide safer routes for emergency and rescue vehicles. This system must consider the information regarding the tsunami alert system and the road state combined with the vehicle performance. Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology allows us to gather and process the information provided by authorities to establish the alert level. A Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) can be used to consider the uncertain regarding the road-status related concepts, such as, flood, objects and alert levels, and to assist authorities to determine whether roads are accessible. The information obtained through these technologies can then be used in a Colored Petri Net (CPN) model in order to obtain safer routes. This proposal has been applied to the Spanish city of Cádiz, due to its population density and its location in a small peninsula close to an active tectonic rift.}

	abstract = {Improving air quality in highly polluted cities is a challenge for today’s society. Most of the proposed strategies include green policies that aim to introduce green infrastructures helping to improve air quality. To design new cities with more green infrastructures, the WRF-Chem model is used to analyze the evolution of the most common pollutants and their dispersion due to the meteorology of the moment. Most of the studies, however, are off an urban scale (hundreds of meters of resolution), and those cases that simulate the meteorology at this resolution need to consider the city’s morphology. Using the city of Barcelona as a case study, this paper confirms that the modeling methodology used up to now must be reviewed to design green cities. Certain limitations of the WRF-Chem model have been analyzed, including the BEP-BEM as an urban canopy layer, and the reasons for such limitations are discussed.}

We perform a sequence of numerical experiments with Physics Informed Neural Network, considering different activation functions, and different ways of enforcing the initial and boundary conditions. We show the convergence of the method and the resulting numerical accuracy for different setups. We show that, indeed, the PINN methodology can solve the problem efficiently and accurately the wave-equations without actually solving a system of linear equations as it happens in traditional numerical methods like, e.g., finite element or finite difference method. In particular, we compare the influence of selected activation functions on the convergence of the PINN method.

	abstract = {Modeling large datasets through Multivariate Functional Approximations (MFA) plays a critical role in scientific analysis and visualization workflows. However, this requires scalable data partitioning approaches to compute MFA representations in a reasonable amount of time. We propose a fully parallel and efficient method for computing MFA with B-spline bases without sacrificing the reconstructed solution accuracy or continuity. Our approach reduces the total work per task and uses a restricted Additive Schwarz (RAS) method to converge control point data across subdomain boundaries. We also provide a detailed analysis of the parallel approach with domain decomposition solvers to minimize subdomain error residuals and recover high-order continuity with optimal communication cost determined by the overlap regions in the RAS implementation. In contrast to previous methods that generally only recover \\(C^1\\) continuity for arbitrary B-spline order p or required post-processing to blend discontinuities in the reconstructed data, the accuracy of the MFA remains bounded as the number of subdomains is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using analytical and scientific datasets in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions and show that it is highly scalable (due to bounded outer iteration counts) and that the parallel performance at scale is directly proportional to the nearest-neighbor communication implementations.}

	abstract = {In recommender systems, users’ preferences for item popularity are diverse and dynamic, which reveals the different items that users prefer. Therefore, identifying user popularity preferences are significant for personalized recommendations. Although many methods have analyzed user popularity preferences, most of them only consider particular types of popularity preferences, leading to inappropriate recommendations for users who have other popularity preferences. To comprehensively study user popularity preferences, we propose a User Popularity preference aware Sequential Recommendation (UPSR) method. By sequentially perceiving user behaviors, UPSR captures the type and the evolution of user popularity preferences. Furthermore, UPSR employs contrastive learning to gather similar users and enhance user interest encoding. Then, we can match items and user popularity preferences more accurately and make more proper recommendations. Extensive experiments validate that UPSR not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods but also reduces popularity bias.}

	abstract = {Traditionally, the random noise is equally injected when training with different data instances in the field of differential privacy (DP). In this paper, we first give sharper excess risk bounds of DP stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. Considering most of the previous methods are under convex conditions, we use Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition to relax it in this paper. Then, after observing that different training data instances affect the machine learning model to different extent, we consider the heterogeneity of training data and attempt to improve the performance of DP-SGD from a new perspective. Specifically, by introducing the influence function (IF), we quantitatively measure the contributions of various training data on the final machine learning model. If the contribution made by a single data instance is so little that attackers cannot infer anything from the model, we do not add noise when training with it. Based on this observation, we design a ‘Performance Improving’ DP-SGD algorithm: PIDP-SGD. Theoretical and experimental results show that our proposed PIDP-SGD improves the performance significantly.}

	abstract = {Data Maps is an interesting method of graphical representation of datasets, which allows observing the model’s behaviour for individual instances in the learning process (training dynamics). The method groups elements of a dataset into easy-to-learn, ambiguous, and hard-to-learn. In this article, we present an extension of this method, Differential Data Maps, which allows you to visually compare different models trained on the same dataset or analyse the effect of selected features on model behaviour. We show an example application of this visualization method to explain the differences between the three personalized deep neural model architectures from the literature and the HumAnn model we developed. The advantage of the proposed HumAnn is that there is no need for further learning for a new user in the system, in contrast to known personalized methods relying on user embedding. All models were tested on the sentiment analysis task. Three datasets that differ in the type of human context were used: user-annotator, user-author, and user-author-annotator. Our results show that with the new explainable AI method, it is possible to pose new hypotheses explaining differences in the quality of model performance, both at the level of features in the datasets and differences in model architectures.}

	abstract = {The term ‘privacy paradox’ refers to the apparent inconsistency between privacy concerns and actual behaviour that also often leads to the dominance of privacy-careless over privacy-respecting platforms. One of the most important explanations for this phenomenon is based on the concept of social norm, which refers to the influence that an individual’s social environment can have on their decisions to accept or reject a specific platform. However, the interdependencies between social norm dynamics and platform adoption have received little attention so far. To overcome this limitation, this article presents a system dynamics simulation model that considers the concept of social norm, shaped by users with diverse privacy concerns, during the adoption process of two alternative social media platforms and identifies the types of situations in which the privacy paradox emerges. The results show a bidirectional minority rule, where (1) the least concerned minority can hinder the more concerned majority from discarding a privacy-careless platform but also (2) the most concerned minority can induce the less concerned majority to adopt a privacy-respecting platform. Both (1) and, to a lesser extent, (2) are types of situations that reflect the privacy paradox.}

	abstract = {The hail cannon has been used to prevent hail storms since the 19th century. The idea of the hail cannon is to create a sequence of shock waves to prevent the formation of clouds before the hail storm. Modern hail cannons employ a mixture of acetylene and oxygen to ignite a sequence of explosions in the lower chamber traveling through the neck and into the cone of the cannon, creating shock waves. The shock waves propagate upwards to the cloud, and they are supposed to prevent the formation of the cloud. According to Wikipedia, there is no scientific evidence for the hail cannon, even though it is commonly used in several countries. In this paper, we propose a numerical simulation to verify the idea of the hail cannon. We employ isogeometric analysis and variational splitting methods. We compare our numerical results with the experimental data. We show that our numerical simulation is indeed the scientific evidence for the hail cannon. We also compare our numerical simulations with the experimental measurements performed with a drone before and after a sequence of generated shock waves.}

	abstract = {The work reported in this article addresses the challenge of building models for non-trivial aerobatic aircraft maneuvers in an automated fashion. It is built using a Behavioural Cloning approach where human pilots provide a set of example maneuvers used by a Machine Learning algorithm to induce a control model for each maneuver. The best examples for each maneuver were selected using a set of objective evaluation metrics. Using those example sets, robust models were induced that could replicate (and in some cases outperform) the human pilots that provided the examples (the clean-up effect). Complete complex maneuvers were performed using a meta-controller capable of sequencing the basic ones learned by imitation. This endeavor was rewarded by the results that show several Machine Learning models capable of performing highly complex aircraft maneuvers.}

	abstract = {The task of four-voice harmonization of a given melody is one of the most fundamental, but at the same time the most complex problems in functional harmony. This problem can be formulated as a discrete optimization problem with constraints using a set of rules coming from the theory of music. Unfortunately, a straightforward solution of such a problem, i.e., a mere fulfillment of the rules, ensures only the formal correctness of the obtained chord sequences, which does not necessarily imply overall musical quality as perceived by humans. Trying to catch some non-formalized factors of this quality we have decided to utilize artificial intelligence methods with some ‘creative‘ potential that can provide solutions at acceptable level of formal correctness. In this paper we perform the harmonization using a genetic algorithm, an algorithm based on a Bayesian network, as well as a hybrid of these. In a series of experiments we compare the performance of the three algorithms with each other and with a rule-based system that provides chord sequences at a high level of formal correctness. Besides the formal evaluation all obtained solutions were rated by musical experts. The results show that the studied algorithms can generate solutions musically more interesting than those produced by the rule-based system, even if the former are less formally correct than the latter.}

	abstract = {Simulation is a useful and effective way to analyze and study complex, real-world systems. It allows researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to make sense of the inner working of a system that involves many factors often resulting in some sort of emergent behavior. The number of parameter value combinations grows exponentially and it quickly becomes infeasible to test them all or even to explore a suitable subset. How does one then efficiently identify the parameter value combinations that matter for a particular simulation study? In addition, is it possible to train a machine learning model to predict the outcome of an agent-based model (ABM) with a systematically chosen small subset of parameter value combinations? We explore these questions in this paper. We propose utilizing covering arrays to create t-way (t = 2, 3, etc.) combinations of parameter values to significantly reduce an ABM’s parameter value exploration space. In our prior work we showed that covering arrays are useful for systematically decreasing an ABM’s parameter space. We now build on that work by applying it to Wilensky’s Heat Bugs model and training a random forest machine learning model to predict simulation results by using the covering arrays to select our training and test data. Our results show that a 2-way covering array provides sufficient training data to train our random forest to predict three different simulation outcomes. Our process of using covering arrays to decrease parameter space to then predict ABM results using machine learning is successful.}

Although many supercomputers have already reached petascale capacities using many-core architectures and accelerators, numerous scientific applications still need to be adapted to make use of these new resources. To ensure a smooth transition to a platform-agnostic code base, we developed a prototype of a portability and parallelization framework named vecpar. In this paper, we introduce the technical concepts, the main features and we demonstrate the framework’s potential by comparing the runtimes of the single-source vecpar implementation (compiled for different architectures) with native serial and parallel implementations, which reveal significant speedup over the former and competitive speedup versus the latter. Further optimizations and extended portability options are currently investigated and are therefore the focus of future work.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks have shown superior capabilities on graphs that contain multiple types of entities with rich semantic information. However, they are usually (semi-)supervised learning methods which rely on costly task-specific labeled data. Due to the problem of label sparsity on heterogeneous graphs, the performance of these methods is limited, prompting the emergence of some self-supervised learning methods. However, most of self-supervised methods aggregate meta-path based neighbors without considering implicit neighbors that also contain rich information, and the mining of implicit neighbors is accompanied by the problem of introducing irrelevant nodes. Therefore, in this paper we propose a self-supervised deep heterogeneous graph neural networks with contrastive learning (DHG-CL) which not only preserves the information of implicitly valuable neighbors but also further enhances the distinguishability of node representations. Specifically, (1) we design a cross-layer semantic encoder to incorporate information from different high-order neighbors through message passing across layers; and then (2) we design a graph-based contrastive learning task to distinguish semantically dissimilar nodes, further obtaining discriminative node representations. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed DHG-CL outperforms the state-of-the-arts.}

	abstract = {The Beryllium-doped (Be-doped) diamond and Beryllium related (Be-X) co-doped diamond have been carefully investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) to explore the possibility to achieve effective and shallow n-type doping in diamond. Although the ionization energy and formation energy of interstitial/substitutional Be-doped diamond is not ideal, the introduction of Be-related co-doping techniques (Be-N/O/S) greatly improves the electrical properties in diamonds. We found, for the first time, n-type diamond doping can be realized in Be-N, Be-O and Be-S co-doped systems, among which Be-N3 has the best performance. Be-N3 has the advantages of low ionization energy (0.25\u2009eV), low formation energy (−1.59\u2009eV), and direct bandgap. The N-2p states play a crucial role in the conduction band edge of Be-N3 co-doped diamond. Hence, the Be-N3 could be expected to become a promising alternative for N-type shallow doping in diamond.}

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies in satellite telemetry data is pivotal in ensuring its safe operations. Although there exist various data-driven techniques for the task of determining abnormal parts of the signal, they are virtually never validated over real telemetries. Analyzing such data is challenging due to its intrinsic characteristics, as telemetry may be noisy and affected by incorrect acquisition, resulting in missing parts of the signal. In this paper, we tackle this issue and propose a machine learning approach for detecting anomalies in single-channel satellite telemetry. To validate its capabilities in a practical scenario, we build a dataset capturing the nominal and anomalous telemetry data captured on board OPS-SAT—a nanosatellite launched and operated by the European Space Agency. Our extensive experimental study showed that the proposed algorithm offers high-quality anomaly detection in real-life satellite telemetry, reaching 98.4% accuracy over the unseen test set.}

	abstract = {The perimeter of a wildfire is essential for prediction of the spread of a wildfire. Real-time information on an active wildfire can be obtained with Thermal InfraRed (TIR) data collected via aerial surveys or satellite imaging, but often lack the actual numerical parametrization of the wildfire perimeter. As such, additional image processing is needed to formulate closed polygons that provide the numerical parametrization of wildfire perimeters. Although a traditional image segmentation method (ISM) that relies on image gradient or image continuity can be used to process a TIR image, these methods may fail to accurately represent a perimeter or boundary of an object when pixels representing high infrared values are sparse and not connected. An ISM processed TIR image with sparse high infrared pixels often results in multiple disconnected sub-objects rather than a complete object. This paper solves the problem of detecting wildfire perimeters from TIR images in three distinct image processing steps. First, Delaunay triangulation is used to connect the sparse and disconnected high-value infrared pixels. Subsequently, a closed (convex) polygon is created by joining adjacent triangles. The final step consists of an iterative trimming method that removes redundant triangles to find the closed (non-convex) polygon that parametrizes the wildfire perimeter. The method is illustrated on a typical satellite TIR image of a wildfire, and the result is compared to those obtained by traditional ISMs. The illustration shows that the three image processing steps summarized in this paper yield an accurate result for representation of the wildfire perimeter.}

	abstract = {When testing scientific software, it is often challenging or even impossible to craft a test oracle for checking whether the program under test produces the expected output when being executed on a given input – also known as the oracle problem in software engineering. Metamorphic testing mitigates the oracle problem by reasoning on necessary properties that a program under test should exhibit regarding multiple input and output variables. A general approach consists of extracting metamorphic relations from auxiliary artifacts such as user manuals or documentation, a strategy particularly fitting to testing scientific software. However, such software typically has large input-output spaces, and the fundamental prerequisite – extracting variables of interest – is an arduous and non-scalable process when performed manually. To this end, we devise a workflow around an autoregressive transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) towards the extraction of variables from user manuals of scientific software. Our end-to-end approach, besides a prompt specification consisting of few examples by a human user, is fully automated, in contrast to current practice requiring human intervention. We showcase our LLM workflow over three case studies of scientific software documentation, and compare variables extracted to ground truth manually labelled by experts.}

	abstract = {The paradigm shift towards data-driven science is massively transforming the scientific process. Scientists use exploratory data analysis to arrive at new insights. This requires them to specify complex data analysis workflows, which consist of compositions of data analysis functions. Said functions encapsulate information extraction, integration, and model building through operations specified in linear algebra, relational algebra, and iterative control flow among these. A key challenge in these complex workflows is to understand and act upon irregularities in these workflows, such as outliers in aggregations. Regardless whether irregularities stem from errors or point to new insights, they must be localized and rationalized, in order to ensure the correctness and overall trustworthiness of the workflow. We propose to automatically reduce a workflow’s input data while still observing some outcome of interest, thereby computing a minimal reproducible example to support workflow debugging. In essence, we reduce the problem to the determination of the input relevant to reproducing the irregularity. To that end, we present a portfolio of different strategies being tailored to data analysis workflows that operate on tabular data. We investigate their feasibility in terms of input reduction, and compare their effectiveness and efficiency within three characteristic cases.}

	abstract = {Learning representations of nodes has been a crucial area of the graph machine learning research area. A well-defined node embedding model should reflect both node features and the graph structure in the final embedding. In the case of dynamic graphs, this problem becomes even more complex as both features and structure may change over time. The embeddings of particular nodes should remain comparable during the evolution of the graph, what can be achieved by applying an alignment procedure. This step was often applied in existing works after the node embedding was already computed. In this paper, we introduce a framework – RAFEN – that allows to enrich any existing node embedding method using the aforementioned alignment term and learning aligned node embedding during training time. We propose several variants of our framework and demonstrate its performance on six real-world datasets. RAFEN achieves on-par or better performance than existing approaches without requiring additional processing steps.}

	abstract = {In Federated Learning (FL), a shared model is learned across dispersive clients each of which often has small and heterogeneous data. As such, datasets in FL setting may suffer from the non-IID (Independent and identically distributed) problem. In this paper, we propose a BAGAN as machine learning model which has the ability to create data for minority classes, and a Bi-FedAvg model as a new approach to mitigate non-IID problems in FL settings. The performance comparison between FedAvg and Bi-FedAvg in both IID and Non-IID environments will be shown in terms of accuracy, converge stability and category cross-entropy loss. On the other hand, the training and testing performance among FedAvg, FedAvg with a conditional GAN model, and FedAvg with BAGAN-GP model, on IID and Non-IID environments with three imbalanced datasets will be compared and discussed. The results indicate that Bi-FedAvg fails to outperform Fed-Avg, for Bi-FedAvg suffers from model quality loss or even divergence when running on non-IID data partitions. In addition to that, our experiments demonstrate that higher quality images for complex image datasets can be generated by BAGAN and combining federated learning and Balancing GAN model together is conducive to obtaining a high-level privacy-preserving capability and achieving more competitive model performance. The project will give an inspired further exploration of the implementation of a combination between Federated learning and BAGAN on image classification in real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Graph machine learning models have been successfully deployed in various application areas. One of the most prominent types of models – Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) – provides an elegant way of extracting expressive node-level representation vectors, which can be used to solve node-related problems, such as classifying users in a social network. However, many tasks require representations at the level of the whole graph, e.g., molecular applications. In order to convert node-level representations into a graph-level vector, a so-called readout function must be applied. In this work, we study existing readout methods, including simple non-trainable ones, as well as complex, parametrized models. We introduce a concept of ensemble-based readout functions that combine either representations or predictions. Our experiments show that such ensembles allow for better performance than simple single readouts or similar performance as the complex, parametrized ones, but at a fraction of the model complexity.}

	abstract = {The adjoint reversal of long evolutionary calculations (e.g. loops), where each iteration depends on the output of the previous iteration, is a common occurrence in computational engineering (e.g. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation), physics (e.g. molecular dynamics) and computational finance (e.g. long Monte Carlo paths). For the edge case of a scalar state, the execution, as well as adjoint control flow reversal, are inherently serial operations, as there is no spatial dimension to parallelize. Our proposed method exploits the run time difference between passive function evaluation and augmented forward evaluation, which is inherent to most adjoint AD techniques. For high dimensional states, additional parallelization of the primal computation can and should be exploited at the spatial level. Still, for problem sizes where the parallelization of the primal has reached the barrier of scalability, the proposed method can be used to better utilize available computing resources and improve the efficiency of adjoint reversal. We expect this method to be especially useful for operator-overloading AD tools. However, the concepts are also applicable to source-to-source transformation and handwritten adjoints, or a hybrid of all approaches. For illustration, C++ reference implementations of a low dimensional evolution (lorenz attractor) and a high dimensional evolution (computational fluid dynamics problem in OpenFOAM) are discussed. Both theoretical bounds on the speedup and run time measurements are presented.}

However, results outside the US have been less clear, particularly in countries with a more diverse political landscape that does not fall into the traditional Liberal/Conservative dichotomy. Here, we expand the Moral Foundations Dictionary to European Portuguese, which we then use to analyze 10 years of transcripts of parliamentary sessions using standard Data Science and Text Mining techniques. Despite a larger number of represented parties, we show that no traditional parties fall into the Conservative or Liberal characterization and that the political landscape in Portugal is relatively homogeneous with the major difference observed concerning the dichotomy between Government and the parliament.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a graph-based approach to modelling and analysis of spatial (GIS) datasets supporting the deployment of smart city solutions. The presented approach is based on the spatially-triggered graph transformations (STGT) methodology, which allows for materialisation of spatial relationships detected using suitable tools, as well as performing measurements and modifications of geometries. The theory is illustrated using a real-world example which concerns street lighting. It shows how an existing traffic sensor network can be used to enable dynamic dimming of lamps, which can result in significant energy usage savings. Also, network analysis is applied to broaden the coverage of such systems, even in case of sensor sparsity. The presented results have been obtained in a real-world project and are due for larger-scale validation in the near future.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new approach to multivariate forecasting cryptocurrency prices using a hybrid contextual model combining exponential smoothing (ES) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The model consists of two tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track provides additional information to the main track, extracted from representative series. This information as well as information extracted from exogenous variables is dynamically adjusted to the individual series forecasted by the main track. The RNN stacked architecture with hierarchical dilations, incorporating recently developed attentive dilated recurrent cells, allows the model to capture short and long-term dependencies across time series and dynamically weight input information. The model generates both point daily forecasts and predictive intervals for one-day, one-week and four-week horizons. We apply our model to forecast prices of 15 cryptocurrencies based on 17 input variables and compare its performance with that of comparative models, including both statistical and ML ones.}

	abstract = {The article presents the results of work on improving sentiment and emotion recognition for Polish texts using a big data-based expansion process and larger neural language models. The proposed recognition method is intended to serve in a therapeutic dialogue system to analyze sentiment and emotion in human utterances. First, the language model is enhanced, by replacing the BERT neural language model with RoBERTa. Next, the emotion-based text corpus is enlarged. A novel process of augmenting an emotion-labeled text corpus using semantically similar data from an unlabeled corpus, inspired by semi-supervised learning methods, is proposed. The process of using the Common Crawl web archive to create an enlarged corpus, named CORTEX+pCC, is presented. An empathetic dialogue system named Terabot, incorporating the elaborated method, is also described. The system is designed to employ elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychiatric patients. The improved language model trained on the enlarged CORTEX+pCC corpus resulted in remarkably improved sentiment and emotion recognition. The average accuracy and F1 scores increased by around 3% and 8% relative, which will allow the dialogue system to operate more appropriately for the emotional state of the patient.}

	abstract = {Missing data can be described by the absence of values in a dataset, which can be a critical issue in domains such as healthcare. A common solution for this problem is imputation, where the missing values are replaced by estimations. Most imputation methods are suitable for the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) and Missing At Random (MAR) mechanisms but produce biased results for Missing Not At Random (MNAR) values. An effective approach to mitigate this bias effect is to use the delta-adjustment method. This method assumes the imputation is performed for the MAR mechanism and adjusts the imputed values to become valid under MNAR assumptions by applying a correction factor. Such adjustment is usually defined manually by a domain expert, which often makes this method unfeasible. In this work, we propose an automatic procedure to find an approximate delta adjustment value for every feature of the dataset, which we call Automatic Delta-Adjustment Method. The proposed procedure is validated in an experimental setup comprising 10 datasets of the healthcare domain injected with MNAR values. The results from seven state-of-the-art imputation methods are compared with and without the adjustment, and applying the correction provides a significantly lower imputation error for all methods.}

The growth of public data, and the increasing practice of data sharing and reuse, emphasises the importance of data provenance and increases the need for modellers to understand how data processing decisions might impact model output. One key step in the data processing pipeline is that of data integration and entity resolution, where entities are matched across disparate datasets. In this paper, we present a new formulation of data integration in complex networks that incorporates integration uncertainty. We define an approach for understanding how different data integration setups can impact the results of network diffusion models under this uncertainty, allowing one to systematically characterise potential model outputs in order to create an output distribution that provides a more comprehensive picture.}

	abstract = {Cyberloafing considered as non-work-related excessive Internet use at work is embedded in everyday’s work across organizations. Despite growing concerns about the waste of energy, time, money, and corporate data security caused by cyberloafing, there is still debate about the impact of cyberloafing on key work-related factors of job demands, work performance, satisfaction, and stress. The existing measures of cyberloafing in organizations seem obsolete, so the need to create a tool tailored to changing repertoire of cyberactivities has become warranted. Therefore, we developed and empirically verified a new Cyberloafing Scale, the CBLS-15, to measure four dimensions and a total score of this phenomenon. The CBLS-15 scale includes 15 items grouped into four dimensions 1) Information browsing (IB), 2) Social networking (SN), 3) Personal matters (PM), and 4) Gambling/Adult content (GA). In support of the external validity of the CBS-15, we found positive associations of cyberloafing with workload, cognitive demands, role conflict, and stress, and negative relationship with work satisfaction and work performance. The CBLS-15 can be useful for researchers and practitioners as a diagnostic tool. Our results are a valuable contribution to the literature on cyberloafing in modern organizations, providing important insights into how work-related factors may influence non-work Internet use at work.}

	abstract = {While fairness-aware machine learning algorithms have been receiving increasing attention, the focus has been on centralized machine learning, leaving decentralized methods underexplored. Federated Learning is a decentralized form of machine learning where clients train local models with a server aggregating them to obtain a shared global model. Data heterogeneity amongst clients is a common characteristic of Federated Learning, which may induce or exacerbate discrimination of unprivileged groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. In this work we propose FAIR-FATE: a novel FAIR FederATEd Learning algorithm that aims to achieve group fairness while maintaining high utility via a fairness-aware aggregation method that computes the global model by taking into account the fairness of the clients. To achieve that, the global model update is computed by estimating a fair model update using a Momentum term that helps to overcome the oscillations of non-fair gradients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in machine learning that aims to achieve fairness using a fair Momentum estimate. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that FAIR-FATE outperforms state-of-the-art fair Federated Learning algorithms under different levels of data heterogeneity.}

	abstract = {We propose a multi-agent cellular automata model for analy-sing the traffic flow with various types of agents (drivers). Agents may differ by their vehicles’ acceleration/deceleration values and the delay value of their decision-making. We propose a model in which the main parameters are chosen to reflect different types of driving. Based on valuable previous works, accurate data for possible acceleration/deceleration are used. Additionally, to accurately reflect the cars’ dimensions and their limited movement in a traffic jam, a small-cell cellular automaton is used, where a set of cells represents one car. We present the results of a numerical simulation showing the influence of the main factors of the driving type on the traffic flow. Research shows that aggressive braking has a greater negative impact on traffic flow than aggressive acceleration.}

	abstract = {Early exit, as an effective method to accelerate pre-trained language models, has recently attracted much attention in the field of natural language processing. However, existing early exit methods are only suitable for low acceleration ratios due to two reasons: (1) The shallow classifiers in the model lack semantic information. (2) Exit decisions in the intermediate layers are unreliable. To address the above issues, we propose a Contrastive self-distillation BERT with kernel alignment-based inference (CsdBERT), which aims to let shallow classifiers learn deep semantic knowledge to make comprehensive predictions. Specifically, we classify the early exit classifiers into teachers and students based on classification loss to distinguish the representation ability of the classifiers. Firstly, we present a contrastive learning approach between teacher and student classifiers to maintain the consistency of class similarity between them. Then, we introduce a self-distillation strategy between these two kinds of classifiers to solidify learned knowledge and accumulate new knowledge. Finally, we design a kernel alignment-based exit mechanism to identify samples of different difficulty for accelerating BERT inference. Experimental results on the GLUE and ELUE benchmarks show that CsdBERT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also maintains \\(95\\%\\) performance at \\(4\\times \\) speed.}

	abstract = {Toward realization of the Digital Flight for the next-generation vehicle, numerical simulation of turning flights of a flying car was performed with consideration of fluid-rigid body interaction. The vehicle use in the paper is electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) octorotor type with four contra-rotating propeller units which successfully performed manned flight test. The simulation is conducted such that the flying car mimicks its real-world counterpart by generating force solely through the rotation of its eight propellers. The moving computational domain method was adopted to realize the free movement of the vehicle in three-dimensional space. The whole computational grid is divided into eight domains to reproduce rotation of propellers. The propeller rotations are achieved without any simplification by applying the multi-axis sliding mesh approach. Moreover, to fly the flying car as intended, an attitude of the body in the flight is controlled properly to by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. As a result, the vehicle flies under only the lift generated by the propeller and the turning flights of a flying car with coaxial propellers are reproduced. In addition, this simulation results are different from analytical results based on simplified aerodynamic force. Therefore, it is suggested that this method is the effective one for numerical flight tests of a multi-rotor aircraft on a computer.}

	abstract = {Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection is one of the challenges for deep networks used for image recognition. Although recent works have proposed several state-of-the-art methods of OoD detection, no clear recommendation exists as to which of the methods is inherently best. Our studies and recent results suggest that there is no universally best OoD detector, as performance depends on the in-distribution (ID) and OoD benchmark datasets. This leaves ML practitioners with an unsolvable problem - which OoD methods should be used in real-life applications where limited knowledge is available on the structure of ID and OoD data. To address this problem, we propose a novel, ensemble-based OoD detector that combines outlierness scores from different categories: prediction score-based, (Mahalanobis) distance-based, and density-based. We showed that our method consistently outperforms individual SoTA algorithms in the task of (i) the detection of OoD samples and (ii) the detection of adversarial examples generated by a variety of attacks (including CW, DeepFool, FGSM, OnePixel, etc.). Adversarial attacks commonly rely on the specific technique of CNN feature extraction (GAP - global average pooling). We found that detecting adversarial examples as OoD significantly improves if we also ensemble over different feature extraction methods(such as GAP, cross-dimensional weighting (CroW), and layer-concatenated GAP). Our method can be readily applied with popular DNN architectures and does not require additional representation retraining for OoD detection (All results are fully reproducible, the source code is available at https://github.com/twalkowiak/WNN-OOD).}

	abstract = {Online Social Networks have revolutionized how we consume and share information, but they have also led to a proliferation of content not always reliable and accurate. One particular type of social accounts is known to promote unreputable content, hyperpartisan, and propagandistic information. They are automated accounts, commonly called bots. Focusing on Twitter accounts, we propose a novel approach to bot detection: we first propose a new algorithm that transforms the sequence of actions that an account performs into an image; then, we leverage the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks to proceed with image classification. We compare our performances with state-of-the-art results for bot detection on genuine accounts/bot accounts datasets well known in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposal, because the detection capability is on par with the state of the art, if not better in some cases.}

The resulting connections can increase the credibility of information about a given entity and serve as a link between different scholarly graphs.

	abstract = {Obtaining overlaps between all pairs from billions of strings is a fundamental computational challenge in de novo whole genome assembly. This paper presents a memory-efficient, massively parallel algorithm that uses GPUs to find overlaps from large sequencing datasets with a very low probability of false positives. Here we use a Rabin-fingerprint-based indexing method which stores the strings with their fingerprints and uses them to generate the fingerprints of suffixes and prefixes. We then sort these fingerprints in hybrid CPU-GPU memory and stream them in GPU to find matches. Experiments show that our implementation can detect a trillion highly probable overlaps within 1.5 billion DNA fragments in just over two hours. Compared to the existing CPU-based approach, it routinely achieves speedups of 5–15x while having a collision rate of 1 in 20 million.}

	abstract = {Prescribed fires are controlled burns of vegetation that follow a burn plan to reduce fuel build-up and mitigate unanticipated wildfire impacts. To understand the risks associated to a prescribed burn, modern fire simulation tools can be used to simulate the progression of a prescribed fire as a function of burn conditions that include ignition patterns, wind conditions, fuel moisture and terrain information. Although fire simulation tools help characterize fire behavior, the unknown non-linear interactions between burn conditions requires the need to run multiple fire simulations (ensembles) to formulate an allowable range on burn conditions for a burn plan. Processing the ensembles is often a labor intensive process run by user-domain experts that interpret the simulation results and carefully label the safety of the prescribed fire. The contribution of this paper is an algorithm of ensemble based learning that automates the safety labeling of ensembles created by a modern fire simulation tool. The automated safety labeling in this algorithm is done by first extracting important prescribed fire performance metrics from the ensembles and learn the allowable range of these metrics from a subset of manually labeled ensembles via a gradient free optimization. Subsequently, remaining ensembles can be labeled automatically based on the learned threshold values. The process of learning and automatic safety labeling is illustrated on 900 ensembles created by QUIC-Fire of a prescribed fire in the Yosemite, CA region. The results show a performance of over 80% matching of learned automated safety labels in comparison to manually generated safety labels created by fire domain experts.}

We present a review of recent research and development in the SLAM application in a wide range of domains, like autonomous driving, robotics and augmented reality (AR). Then we focus on the methods selected from the perspective of their usefulness in the AR systems for training and servicing the flight simulators. The localization and mapping in such an environment are much more complex than in others since the flight simulator is relatively small and close area. Our previous experiments showed that the built-in SLAM system in HoloLens is insufficient for such areas and has to be enhanced with additional elements, like QR codes. Therefore, the presented study on other methods can improve the localization and mapping of AR systems in flight simulators.}

The study focuses on Chameleon, a task-based dense linear algebra software whose routines are computed using a tile-based algorithmic scheme and executed in the available computing resources of the system using a scheduler which dynamically handles data dependencies among the basic computational kernels of each linear algebra routine. The proposed strategies are applied to select the best values for the parameters that affect the performance of the routines, such as the tile size or the scheduling policy, among others. Also, parallel optimized implementations provided by existing linear algebra libraries, such as Intel MKL (on multicore CPU) or cuBLAS (on GPU) are used to execute each of the computational kernels of the routines. Results obtained on a heterogeneous system composed of several multicore and multiGPU are satisfactory, with performances close to the experimental optimum.}
