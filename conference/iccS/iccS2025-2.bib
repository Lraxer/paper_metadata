	abstract = {Multiplexes (also termed Multilayer Networks or networks of networks) are useful for modeling data sets with multiple entity types, and relationships among them. The notion of\xa0a community is well-defined for simple graphs (or a monoplex/network) and is widely used for aggregate analysis on graphs. Several simple graph algorithms (e.g., Infomap, Louvain) for computing a community and algorithms for computing other metrics (e.g., centrality, substructure, etc.) exist as well. Although multilayer networks (MLNs) are used for modeling, the concept of a community\xa0and algorithms for its computation are lacking. Ideally, an\xa0MLN community definition should be comparable to the simple\xa0graph definition and be a generalization. As MLNs have structure in\xa0terms of layers, including inter-layer edges, it is important to define\xa0a community that includes its structure and semantics. The resulting community should also be an MLN. The focus of this paper is\xa0on heterogeneous MLN (or HeMLN), which is a type of MLN with explicitly defined inter-layer edges. In this paper, we introduce a community definition\xa0for HeMLNs that is structure-preserving and is also consistent with\xa0the traditional definition. Layer semantics are also preserved\xa0for drill-down and visualization. First, we define a community for\xa0any k connected layers of a HeMLN (termed k-community (1-community is the same as\xa0the traditional community on a simple graph or a layer of HeMLN.))\xa0using binary composition. Then, we propose an algorithm for\xa0its computation using the concept of bipartite graphs. Further, we\xa0show how weight metrics can be customized to include the semantics\xa0of participating community characteristics. Our definition:\xa0i) leverages extant simple graph community computation algorithms,\xa0ii) composes partial results from different layers for computing\xa0HeMLN communities (i.e., uses the decoupling approach), iii)\xa0is customizable using weight metrics based on participating communities, and iv) is computationally efficient. We\xa0have experimentally validated the community concept (definition\xa0and computation) on several real-world and synthetic data sets.}

	abstract = {We propose an iterative quantum-assisted least squares (i-QLS) optimization method that leverages quantum annealing\xa0to overcome the scalability and precision limitations of prior quantum least squares approaches. Unlike traditional QUBO-based formulations, which suffer from an exponential qubit overhead due\xa0to fixed discretization, our approach refines the solution\xa0space iteratively, enabling exponential convergence while maintaining\xa0a constant qubit requirement per iteration. This iterative refinement transforms the problem into an anytime algorithm, allowing\xa0for flexible computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we extend\xa0our framework beyond linear regression to non-linear function approximation via spline-based modeling, demonstrating\xa0its adaptability to complex regression tasks. We empirically validate i-QLS on the D-Wave quantum annealer, showing that our method efficiently scales to high-dimensional problems, achieving competitive accuracy with classical solvers while outperforming prior quantum approaches. Experiments confirm that i-QLS enables near-term quantum hardware to perform regression tasks with improved precision and scalability, paving the way for practical quantum-assisted machine learning applications.}

	abstract = {Network modularity is central to understanding phenomena in diverse domains, from biology and social science to engineering\xa0and computational physics. However, computing the optimal modularity—an NP-hard measure quantifying community strength—has remained computationally intractable at large scales. Most approaches resort to heuristics without formal optimality guarantees. This paper contributes to the computational science of complex systems by introducing a novel MaxSAT-based framework that\xa0can compute optimal network modularity values for larger networks\xa0than previously possible. Leveraging this new capability, we extensively evaluate heuristic solutions and, for the first time, include\xa0the state-of-the-art memetic graph clustering heuristic VieClus. Remarkably, VieClus identifies optimal modularity values for all tested networks, ranging from 103 previously studied instances to 52 new, larger ones, and does so in seconds.\xa0This result contrasts with earlier conclusions that heuristics frequently fail to find the optimal modularity. By combining a powerful MaxSAT encoding, which supports\xa0proof logging for verification, with a fast and effective heuristic,\xa0we demonstrate that even intricate network structures can be tackled efficiently. This synergy brings us closer to making complex network analysis and community detection tractable, robust,\xa0and verifiable—a goal firmly aligned with the core mission\xa0of computational science.}

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of websites has posed significant challenges to cyberspace management. To effectively manage websites, we introduce the innovative concept of website association in\xa0this paper and propose a website association model, WebAA. Website association seeks to determine whether target websites belong to\xa0the same organization based on their features, playing a crucial role\xa0in cyberspace management. Unlike website identification, website association enables more accurate organizational alignment through fine-grained analysis of website features. Specifically, malicious website association helps investigators identify the organizations behind them, thereby addressing the root causes of the harm\xa0they cause. In simple terms, the proposed website association model\xa0in this paper consists of four modules. In the first module,\xa0we calculate the similarity score based on external resources\xa0by analyzing the dependency relationships of the target websites\xa0on these resources. The second module employs the BERT model to analyze the similarity of HTML texts between the target websites\xa0and generates a similarity score. The third module focuses on\xa0the website domain names, calculating their similarity using Levenshtein distance and obtaining the similarity score. In the fourth module, the final similarity score is obtained by weighting the\xa0three similarity scores, which is then used to determine whether the\xa0two websites belong to the same organization. Extensive experiments\xa0on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can efficiently associate thousands of website pairs within milliseconds with\xa0an accuracy exceeding 90%. Striving for applicability\xa0and replicability, we release ready-to-use raw data from our study.}

	abstract = {Urban mobility plays a crucial role in the functioning\xa0of cities, influencing economic activity, accessibility, and quality\xa0of life. However, the effectiveness of analytical models\xa0in understanding urban mobility patterns can be significantly affected by the spatial scales employed in the analysis. This paper explores the impact of spatial scales on the performance of the gravity\xa0model in explaining urban mobility patterns using public transport\xa0flow data in Singapore. The model is evaluated across multiple spatial scales of origin and destination locations, ranging from individual bus stops and train stations to broader regional aggregations. Results indicate the existence of an optimal intermediate spatial scale at which the gravity model performs best. At the finest scale, where individual transport nodes are considered, the model exhibits poor performance due to noisy and highly variable travel patterns. Conversely, at larger scales, model performance also suffers\xa0as over-aggregation of transport nodes results in excessive generalisation which obscures the underlying mobility dynamics. Furthermore, distance-based spatial aggregation of transport\xa0nodes proves to outperform administrative boundary-based aggregation, suggesting that actual urban organisation and movement patterns\xa0may not necessarily align with imposed administrative divisions.\xa0These insights highlight the importance of selecting appropriate spatial scales in mobility analysis and urban modelling in general, offering valuable guidance for urban and transport planning efforts aimed\xa0at enhancing mobility in complex urban environments.}

	abstract = {Instant Messaging (IM) applications, such as Telegram and WeChat, have become indispensable tools for individuals. To protect users’ privacy, popular IM applications employ advanced encryption mechanisms. However, we demonstrate that the encrypted traffic of popular IM applications can still leak information about users’ social relationships. In this paper, we reveal that the message notification traffic in IM application is exploitable and propose a novel privacy attack called NotiCorr, which allows an adversary to infer the users in the same group based on flow correlation. Specifically, even if the IM application is not running, the client will still instantly receive group message notifications. To this end, we extract robust fingerprints from both message notification and message transmission traffic to enable attacks in more realistic usage scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the privacy risks posed by message notification traffic in IM applications. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NotiCorr significantly outperforms related methods. Finally, we discuss the mitigation strategies.}

	abstract = {Hailstorms are intense, localized weather phenomena that can severely impact agriculture, infrastructure, and property, making precise forecasting essential for risk management. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is widely used for numerical weather prediction, offering numerous physical parameterization options to represent atmospheric processes. However, due to the large number of possible configurations, identifying the most suitable configuration is a challenge. This research uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to systematically refine WRF physics schemes for hail prediction in Central Europe, specifically for the hail events of June 2022. Within this framework, WRF configurations are treated as individuals in a population that evolves through selection, crossover, and mutation over multiple iterations. Fitness is evaluated using the F2 score. This methodology allows to evaluate more than 2.4 million possible setups improving the WRF model’s capacity to accurately represent hailstorms. This strategy provides a robust framework for testing a wide range of setups, proving its value in refining parameterizations to better forecast impactful weather phenomena.}

	abstract = {Memes are widely used for humor and cultural commentary, but they are increasingly exploited to spread hateful content. Due to their multimodal nature, hateful memes often evade traditional text-only or image-only detection systems, particularly when they employ subtle or coded references. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal hate detection framework that integrates key components: OCR to extract embedded text, captioning to describe visual content neutrally, sub-label classification for granular categorization of hateful content, RAG for contextually relevant retrieval, and VQA for iterative analysis of symbolic and contextual cues. This enables the framework to uncover latent signals that simpler pipelines fail to detect. Experimental results on the Facebook Hateful Memes dataset reveal that the proposed framework exceeds the performance of unimodal and conventional multimodal models in both accuracy and AUC-ROC.}

	abstract = {Optimization plays a central role in modern radiation therapy, where it is used to determine optimal treatment machine parameters in order to deliver precise doses adapted to each patient case. In general, solving the optimization problems that arise can present a computational bottleneck in the treatment planning process, as they can be large in terms of both variables and constraints. As high precision is often sought, second-order optimization algorithms, such as sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and/or interior point methods (IPM) are commonly used. Existing implementations of these algorithms often use direct linear solvers internally, and are typically intended to run on CPUs. Utilizing iterative linear solvers instead is an active research topic in the optimization community, and one which carries the potential to enable efficient GPU acceleration for these types of optimization problems. Numerical stability issues make this a difficult problem for optimization solvers targeting problems from a wide range of application areas, however. In this paper, we develop and implement a GPU-accelerated interior point method for optimization problems from radiation therapy using iterative linear algebra. We utilize a so called doubly augmented formulation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker linear systems, together with a Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, which is able to find sufficiently accurate search directions while running on GPU. By evaluating our solver on real optimization problems from a commercial treatment planning system for radiation therapy, we show that our method can accelerate the aggregated time-to-solution by 1.4 and 4.4 times, respectively, for two patient cases.}

This paper addresses the challenge of detecting malicious webpages using LLMs, an area with limited research. We evaluate LLMs by expanding zero-shot and few-shot query formulations, testing previously unassessed open-source and proprietary models, and assessing robustness under adversarial conditions. Additionally, we verify model performance using Chain of Thought reasoning and compare these explanations with traditional methods.

The issue of adjusting neural network structure is one of the core problems in artificial intelligence. A\xa0highly desirable scenario is a dynamic architecture that evolves structurally during the training process. In this paper, we propose a new and powerful tool that facilitates dynamic changes in network structure. We introduce a novel form of residual connections based on matrix extensions, enabling adaptable weight matrices and enhancing structural flexibility. The approach enhance the potential for structural modifications. We conducted a series of comprehensive experiments confirming that the new residual connections scheme behaves very well. The new type of connection improves performance by enabling better error flow during the error backpropagation phase, resulting in more efficient training. Our method demonstrates superior performance and enhanced trackability during the training process. The paper is supplemented by Python source code to ensure reproducibility. This method marks a significant starting point, showing immense potential for more advanced dynamic neural network models and transfer learning with dynamic models.}

	abstract = {The recent rise of Bitcoin has sparked an unprecedented trend of enthusiasts acquiring expensive hardware for mining. This self-perpetuating race, driven by Bitcoin’s PoW consensus mechanism, has led to the creation of massive computational centers dedicated solely to solving impractical hash inversions. However, these computational resources could be redirected toward more meaningful tasks if nodes were properly incentivized. In this paper, we introduce Proof of Training (PoT), a novel consensus mechanism that offers two key advantages over previous approaches. First, it replaces wasteful computations with ML training. Second, by aligning the inherent distrust between nodes in blockchain networks with distributed model training, PoT not only achieves consensus but also produces a trained model along with proof that it was trained on the client-provided data. PoT enables clients to hire the blockchain network to provably train arbitrary models using their provided datasets and architectures. Meanwhile, nodes that participate in training are rewarded with PoT cryptocurrency based on their computational contributions.}

	abstract = {This study presents two novel approaches for developing a multiple-meta-instance selection method, an advanced algorithm designed for efficient pruning of training sample in classification problems. The proposed meta-instance selection framework reformulates the traditional instance selection problem by introducing a meta-feature space, a problem-agnostic representation space. The transformation enables instance selection to be framed as a classification task in the meta-feature space, facilitating efficient computation with a time complexity of O(nlog(n)). A standard classification algorithm, such as Random Forest, can then be employed in the meta-feature space to determine the inclusion or exclusion of individual samples. To enhance performance, we explore two strategies for combining multiple meta-instance selection algorithms: (1) constructing an ensemble of meta-classifiers and (2) concatenating many meta-sets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the meta-set concatenation approach surpasses both classical instance selection techniques and existing meta-instance selection methods. Moreover, the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates the instance selection process—achieving even by two or three orders of magnitude speed-up, depending on dataset size and the reference instance selection method.}

The proposed approach combines B-spline basis functions with the PIES formalism to approximate the results in challenging problems such as notched plates or concentrated loads. The B-spline function with a specific degree and knots is used in approximating series instead of previously applied polynomials (such as Lagrange or Chebyshev). Increasing knot multiplicity to reduce continuity at some locations or increasing the number of knots in singular regions allows for more accurate results. The proposed approach is validated through selected problems. The results confirm that the B-spline-enhanced PIES approach can effectively solve singular problems with improved accuracy.}

	abstract = {Boolean matrix factorization aims to represent binary data as a product of two factor matrices, in order to uncover the underlying structure of the data and find a compressed representation. However, finding the factors of a given ground truth is computationally hard and calls for fast implementations that accomplish a good approximation in reasonable time. We present cuTeBool, a novel parallel algorithm that exploits Tensor Cores on CUDA-enabled GPUs for fast matrix operations based on a randomized approach. Our comprehensive performance evaluation shows that it produces approximate factorization competitive to other state-of-the-art tools within vastly reduced runtime for a variety of input matrices. Moreover, our algorithm is the only available method that scales well with the size of the ground truth and is able to factorize matrices that are at least one order-of-magnitude larger than all competitors. We further analyze algorithmic parameters allowing us to find a trade-off between performance and reconstruction quality.}

	abstract = {The detection of malicious traffic remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity, particularly with the widespread adoption of encryption protocols, which obscure malicious activities within legitimate network traffic. Traditional detection methods typically rely on single-flow analysis and fail to capture the multi-flow interactions present in malicious traffic, resulting in poor detection performance in scenarios with mixed benign and malicious flows. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages multi-instance learning (MIL) to address the challenge of mixed traffic by aggregating flows into bags and employing attention mechanisms to prioritize critical instances. Our framework processes encrypted traffic by first segmenting bursts to capture traffic patterns, followed by CNN-based feature extraction to identify relevant characteristics. The attention pooling mechanism then prioritizes significant instances, effectively filtering out irrelevant flows and emphasizing multi-flow interactions that are indicative of attacks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and precision, highlighting the framework’s effectiveness in detecting encrypted malicious traffic in complex network environments.}

	abstract = {The purpose of the article is to develop a new dimensionality reduction algorithm for data that are described by many features of different nature. A method of feature selection is based on a new concept of metrical importance of the features. The concept of feature importance is based on metrical properties of data and is inspired by the principle component analysis. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method and certain accordance of it with other concepts of feature importance.}

	abstract = {In meta-learning tasks with tabular data, the choice of meta-features significantly impacts model performance and interpretability. This study investigates the necessity and methods of meta-feature selection in the context of meta-learning, particularly for tabular datasets. We address the fundamental question: Is it better to select a subset of meta-features or use the entire feature set? We examine various selection techniques, including filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, as well as a novel causal-based approach utilizing counterfactual reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that feature selection generally enhances performance, with causal-based methods, especially those leveraging counterfactual generation, showing superior efficiency and generalizability. Furthermore, we explore how these methods fare under shifts in data, particularly when non-informative features are added. The results reveal that the counterfactual method maintains high efficacy across different meta-learners and exhibits a favorable balance between model performance and interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of meta-feature selection in improving the adaptability and transparency of meta-learners for tabular data tasks.

	abstract = {The paper presents a posteriori error estimation strategy in the parametric integral equation system (PIES). It uses collocation point differences between solutions obtained numerically by PIES and another solutions interpolated based on the initial PIES analysis. Various techniques for interpolation are proposed: by repeating the interpolation omitting one collocation point, by interpolating using only values from adjacent collocation points and by the one degree higher polynomial obtained using the least squares approximation. This allows the calculation of local and global percentage error using the integral over the mentioned differences. Finally, it can be applied to ensure convergence of the solutions using the PIES method or to adaptive refinement of distribution or number of collocation points by identifying boundary regions where the error is relatively high.}
