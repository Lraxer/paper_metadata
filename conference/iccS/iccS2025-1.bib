	abstract = {Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the interplay between machine learning (ML) and cheminformatics has driven advancements in bioactivity prediction. However, the challenge of model explainability remains a significant barrier to adopting these approaches in drug discovery. This study addresses critical shortcomings in existing modeling techniques by examining the assumptions of feature independence and contribution additivity that are the foundation of traditional explainability methods. We investigate fingerprint-based and molecular graph models within quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling. While these models demonstrate impressive predictive performance, they offer limited actionable insights for medicinal chemists. To assist researchers in developing useful and interpretable activity prediction models, we propose a new benchmark based on the pharmacophore concept, commonly used in preliminary compound filtering. Furthermore, we introduce PharmacoScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess whether ML-based explanations prioritize essential pharmacophore components over non-critical features. Our findings highlight a crucial misalignment between ML model explanations and established pharmacophore principles, revealing a pressing need for innovative interpretability strategies in cheminformatics. This work not only offers a valuable resource but also sets the stage for future research, enhancing the transparency of ML in drug discovery.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of a reinforcement learning algorithm known as the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network to discover bus scheduling strategies and compare them against conventional approaches. In particular, we look into real-time control strategies where buses may choose to stay or leave at bus stops. We explore both waiting time and travel time as the optimization objectives. The results for uniform bus frequency show that average waiting time can be reduced by allowing buses to stay longer at stops with higher passengers’ arrival rate but at the cost of increased average travel time. This is also supported by our analytical calculation on a theoretical bus loop model. We then apply our method to a model based on a real world bus loop in Nanyang Technological University. The results highlight the potential benefit of reinforcement learning methods to find novel strategies that can be better than conventional approaches.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach for crafting targeted adversarial examples (attacks) using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Our method leverages XAI to identify key input elements that, when altered, can mislead NLP models, such as BERT and large language models (LLMs), into producing specific incorrect outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our targeted attacks across a range of NLP tasks and models, even in scenarios where internal model access is restricted. Our approach is particularly effective in zero-shot learning settings, underscoring its adaptability and transferability to both traditional and conversational AI systems. In addition, we outline mitigation strategies, demonstrating that adversarial training and fine-tuning can enhance model defenses against such attacks. Although our work highlights the vulnerabilities of LLMs and BERT models to adversarial manipulation, it also lays the groundwork for developing more robust models, advancing the dual goal of understanding and securing black-box NLP systems. Through targeted adversarial examples and SHAP-based techniques, we not only expose the weaknesses of existing models but also propose strategies to enhance AI’s resilience to deceptive linguistic input.}

	abstract = {Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINN) train the parameters of neural networks (NN) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). They perform unsupervised training based on the physical laws described by the weak-form residuals of the PDE over an underlying discretized variational setting; thus defining a loss function in the form of a weighted sum of multiple definite integrals representing a testing scheme. However, this classical VPINN loss function is not robust. To overcome this, we employ Robust Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RVPINN), which modifies the original VPINN loss into a robust counterpart that produces both lower and upper bounds of the true error. The robust loss modifies the original VPINN loss by using the inverse of the Gram matrix computed with the inner product of the energy norm. The drawback of this robust loss is the computational cost related to the need to compute several integrals of residuals, one for each test function, multiplied by the inverse of the proper Gram matrix. In this work, we show how to perform efficient generation of the loss and training of RVPINN method on GPGPU using a sequence of einsum tensor operations. As a result, we can solve our 2D model problem within 350\xa0s on A100 GPGPU card from Google Colab Pro. We advocate using the RVPINN with proper tensor operations to solve PDEs efficiently and robustly. Our tensorial implementation allows for 18 times speed up in comparison to for-loop type implementation on the A100 GPGPU card.}

The desired function of spatial coordinates, corresponding to the refractive index, is represented as a deep neural network.

	abstract = {Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) provided new potential in harvesting wind energy in far offshore deep-sea regions and contributed to the world decarbonization Net-Zero target. Providing structural health monitoring (SHM) is crucial for ensuring the structural integrity of FOWT in lifecycle. However, the SHM is technically challenging with high Operational and Maintenance Expenditure (OPEX). Recently, Digital Twin (DT) and advanced sensor technologies offer alternative solutions to provide effective strategy in SHM remotely. Data-driven DT with deep learning models can formulate highly nonlinear dynamics systems. Yet, these existing models only perform the “black box” prediction without explicitly modeling the spatial-temporal relationship and consider only homogenous loading exerted in contrast to the complicated loading combination of FOWT with wind, wave and sea current. To address the existing modelling limitations, a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Encoder-Decoder-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) surrogate model of FOWT is presented in this work, which can perform 50 times faster than the real-time of simulation data set with accurate prediction of wind turbine tower bottom forces in the dominant dynamic modes force-aft and side-side directions. The training data is based on the software QBlade simulation and focuses on the OC4 5MW DeepCwind FOWT structure. A holistic quantitative analysis is carried out to validate the tractable latent space vectors for this complex FOWT system.}

	abstract = {Low-rank adapters (LoRAs) have emerged as an efficient method for customizing large-scale diffusion models, but their internal representations remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive investigation of the interpretability of adapter weight-spaces for image diffusion models. To that end, we open-source a dataset of 100,000 Stable Diffusion adapters fine-tuned across a hierarchy of image concepts amounting to 264 leaf classes, complete with training metadata. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that adapter weights encode meaningful semantic information about their training data, enabling direct interpretation without image generation. We evaluate multiple weight-space representations, including raw parameters, statistical summaries, and learned embeddings, to determine their effectiveness in predicting training data characteristics. To demonstrate real-world impact, we apply our findings to the critical task of detecting potentially harmful content on newly introduced NSFW (Not Safe For Work) toy dataset of Stable Diffusion LoRAs fine-tuned on harmful content. This work advances the interpretability of adapter-based fine-tuning and provides practical tools for understanding and auditing adapted diffusion models.}

	abstract = {Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth’s magnetosphere driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and O’Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the 2015 St. Patrick’s Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution.}

	abstract = {Human activity recognition systems using visual content analysis algorithms use data collected from a variety of sensors, the most popular of which are RGB cameras. Highly accurate motion information can be recorded using motion capture and then used to generate synthetic human body models. The advantage of such data is the absence of other objects in the background, the visualization accuracy and the anonymity of a person. This paper proposes a modified action recognition approach which creates action representations using simple features observed over time, including shape measurements, ratios and centroid trajectory. A feature vector consists of shape descriptors calculated separately for each video frame. These are then normalised, transformed to the frequency domain and supplemented with trajectory information. Action representations are classified using a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer and varying number of hidden neurons. The high effectiveness values obtained in the experiments show that the appropriate composition of elementary features of moving objects brings considerable benefits.}

	abstract = {This research examines the effectiveness of super-resolution techniques in improving object detection accuracy in football. Given the sport’s fast pace and the need for precise tracking of players and the ball, super-resolution can offer significant improvements. The study applies super-resolution techniques to SoccerNet football videos and evaluates their impact on Faster R-CNN detection accuracy. Findings reveal a significant boost in object detection accuracy following the application of super-resolution preprocessing. Enhancing object detection by integrating super-resolution techniques provides substantial advantages, particularly in low-resolution settings, with a 12% rise in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) range of 0.50:0.95 for 320\xa0\\(\\times \\)\xa0240 pixel images when the resolution is quadrupled using RLFN. As the image dimensions grow, the extent of improvement becomes less pronounced; however, a consistent enhancement in detection quality remains clear. Moreover, the implications of these results for real-time sports analytics, player tracking, and the overall viewing experience are discussed.}

	abstract = {The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) has been extended to kilometer-scale (km-ELM) resolutions, enabling high-fidelity simulations of terrestrial processes at 1\xa0km \\(\\times \\) 1\xa0km grid spacing. In ELM, domain decomposition partitions the computational domain across processors, ensuring efficient parallel execution. Currently, round-robin decomposition is applied, providing a straightforward way to distribute computational workload. As ELM continues evolving at the kilometer-scale (km-scale), particularly with integrating lateral flow modeling, decomposition strategies must also account for the increased workload and data movement. This paper introduces a flexible user-defined domain decomposition framework, allowing users to customize domain partitioning based on application requirements. The impact of different decomposition strategies is evaluated across various applications concerning computation, communication, and I/O. Results demonstrate that while 1D partitioning yields superior I/O performance, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) clustering effectively reduces inter-process communication overhead. This study lays the groundwork for scalable partitioning in large-scale land surface simulations, enhancing next-generation Earth system modeling.}

	abstract = {In this study, we explore the limitations of early-exit architectures, which are designed to enhance computational efficiency in neural networks, focusing particularly on both single and multi-label classification tasks within the computer vision domain. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework that not only advances research in this area but also bridges an important gap in understanding how these architectures perform within the complexities of multi-label settings. Our findings reveal a significant challenge: while early-exits improve efficiency without compromising accuracy in single-label tasks, they struggle to offer similar benefits in multi-label classification, necessitating uniquely tailored strategies. Further insights from our ablation suggest that the difficulty in achieving benefits from early-exits in multi-label classification may stem from the varying complexities of processing distinct classes within a single instance. This work lays a solid foundation for future research focused on developing early-exit strategies that effectively handle the complexities of diverse classification contexts.}

	abstract = {As climate change increases the threat of weather-related disasters, the importance of weather control research is growing. The goal of weather control is to mitigate disaster risks by applying interventions with optimal timing, location, and intensity. This study considers a simulation-based control framework in which interventions in the wind velocity field serve as inputs and accumulated precipitation as the output. The objective is to identify optimal interventions that minimize total precipitation. However, the optimization process is highly challenging due to the vast scale and complexity of weather phenomena, which introduces two major challenges. First, obtaining accurate gradient information for optimization is difficult. In addition, numerical weather prediction models demand enormous computational resources, necessitating parameter optimization with minimal function evaluations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method for designing weather interventions based on black-box optimization, which enables efficient exploration without requiring gradient information. The proposed method is evaluated in two distinct control scenarios: one-shot initial value intervention and sequential intervention based on model predictive control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted among four representative black-box optimization methods in terms of total rainfall reduction. Experimental results show that Bayesian optimization achieves higher control effectiveness than the others, particularly in high-dimensional search spaces. These findings suggest that Bayesian optimization is a highly effective approach for weather intervention computation.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection is a commonly used and critical defense mechanism in the field of cybersecurity for identifying abnormal traffic online. However, the phenomenon of concept drift leads to a decrease in the accuracy of online intrusion detection systems in recognizing malicious traffic. Traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems are unable to adapt to the changes in data distribution of dynamic data streams. To address this issue, we propose DWOIDS, an online intrusion detection system based on dual adaptive windows and a Hoeffding tree classifier. When concept drift occurs in network data streams, it employs dual adaptive windows to monitor the prediction error of the classifier, continuously refining the classifier’s accuracy in identifying malicious traffic. We conducted experimental evaluations on multiple datasets. Our proposed method demonstrated superior classification performance when compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {The emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019 sparked a global pandemic, profoundly impacting societies and economies worldwide. To mitigate its spread, governments have implemented various preventive measures, prompting extensive research into transmission risk assessment. To evaluate the transmission risk systematically, we developed a framework integrating agent-based modeling (ABM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and applied the framework to a preschool COVID-19 cluster in Singapore as a case study. Individual movement and behaviors are simulated with ABM, and CFD is employed to compute virus particle flow which is critical for transmission risk. In the case study, we categorized the infected individual’s movement into three types based on the initial destinations and evaluated its impact on the transmission risk. Simulation results show that the average risk level is nearly the same for all three movement types and it changes across time depending on the degree of infected individual’s active movement.}

	abstract = {The transactional activity of a bank’s customers contains a wealth of information regarding their behavior. By examining the transactions of either a specific group or all clients of the bank, it is possible to gain insight into the macroeconomic environment and utilize this to anticipate various outcomes. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic behavioral model for bank clients based on econophysics principles. Additionally, we identified the non-homogeneous function in the dynamic equation using physics-informed neural network. We also interpreted this non-homogeneity through the lens of news reports from social media platforms and news agencies. The model demonstrated accurate results in a numerical simulation of the restoration of the initial dependency. We also showed the potential for creating scenarios in which news events impact the behavior of bank customers.}

	abstract = {Analyzing multi-featured time series data is critical for space missions making efficient event detection, potentially onboard, essential for automatic analysis. However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature’s magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA’s MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA’s THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.}

	abstract = {Explicitly simulating the transport of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) across anatomical scales with submicron precision—necessary for capturing ligand-receptor interactions between CTCs and endothelial walls—remains infeasible even on modern supercomputers. In this work, we extend the hybrid CPU-GPU adaptive physics refinement (APR) method to couple a moving finely resolved region capturing adhesive dynamics between a cancer cell and nearby endothelium to a bulk fluid domain. We present algorithmic advancements that: enable the window to traverse vessel walls, resolve adhesive interactions within the moving window, and accelerate adhesive computations with GPUs. We provide an in-depth analysis of key implementation challenges, including trade-offs in data movement, memory footprint, and algorithmic complexity. Leveraging the advanced APR techniques introduced in this work, we simulate adhesive cancer cell transport within a large microfluidic device at a fraction of the computational cost of fully explicit models. This result highlights our method’s ability to significantly expand the accessible problem sizes for adhesive transport simulations, enabling more complex and computationally demanding studies.}

	abstract = {Advancing single-cell analysis requires tools that not only enable precise experimental measurements but also offer predictive capabilities to guide device optimization and expand experimental possibilities. This study addresses this need by developing a digital twin framework for mechano-node-pore sensing (mechano-NPS), a high-throughput microfluidic platform for single-cell analysis. By creating a virtual replica that integrates models of fluid dynamics and cellular behavior, the digital twin serves as a critical tool for both device development and hypothesis exploration. The foundation of the digital twin was established by accurately modeling the fluid dynamics within the mechano-NPS device, with simulations at various inlet pressures verified against analytical solutions. To ensure biological relevance, cellular models were rigorously tested to replicate key behaviors within the platform. The digital twin’s performance was validated against experimental data, focusing on cell velocity and whole cell deformation index (wCDI). While variances in cell velocity highlighted systematic biases, the strong agreement of simulated wCDI with experimental results underscores the digital twin’s reliability. This framework not only demonstrates the potential to enhance the mechano-NPS platform but also exemplifies how digital twins can transform experimental approaches in cellular biology.}

	abstract = {Scientific computing increasingly depends on neural architecture search (NAS) to identify accurate neural networks (NNs) that facilitate breakthroughs in various fields, from protein classification to material discovery. However, conventional NAS workflows face challenges due to excessive training times and inefficient energy consumption resulting from redundant computations and inflexible orchestration. In this paper, we present A4NN.2, the next generation of the Analytics for Neural Network (A4NN) workflow, which overcomes these challenges by introducing a structural similarity engine and advanced orchestration using the Wilkins framework. These enhancements eliminate redundant training and enable modular high-performance workflow executions. A4NN.2 accelerates NN training, reduces energy consumption, and demonstrates broad applicability across benchmark datasets and scientific domains. When used to train NNs to classify protein configurations from X-ray images, A4NN.2 achieves significant efficiency gains by reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, thus accelerating scientific discovery in structural biology.}
