The procedure uses data describing the real social relations in the community, like marital status or number of kids. Results show the power-law behavior of the distribution of links and, typical for small worlds, the independence of the clustering coefficient on the size of the graph.}

	abstract = {Recently, efforts have been made in computational criminology to study the dynamics of criminal organisations and improve law enforcement measures. To understand the evolution of a criminal network, current literature uses social network analysis and agent-based modelling as research tools. However, these studies only explain the short-term adaptation of a criminal network with a simplified mechanism for introducing new actors. Moreover, most studies do not consider the spatial factor, i.e. the underlying social network of a criminal network and the social environment in which it is active. This paper presents a computational modelling approach to address this literature gap by combining an agent-based model with an explicit social network to simulate the long-term evolution of a criminal organisation. To analyse the dynamics of a criminal organisation in a population, different social networks were modelled. A comparison of the evolution between the different networks was carried out, including a topological analysis (secrecy, flow of information and size of largest component). This paper demonstrates that the underlying structure of the network does make a difference in its development. In particular, with a preferentially structured population, the prevalence of criminal behaviour is very pronounced. Moreover, the preferential structure provides criminal organisations a certain efficiency in terms of secrecy and flow of information.}

	abstract = {Recent studies on anthropogenic climate change demonstrate a disproportionate effect on agriculture in the Global South and North. Questionnaires have become a common tool to capture the impact of climatic shocks on household agricultural income and consequently on farmers’ adaptation strategies. These questionnaires are high-dimensional and contain data on several aspects of an individual (household) such as spatial and demographic characteristics, socio-economic conditions, farming practices, adaptation choices, and constraints. The extraction of insights from these high-dimensional datasets is far from trivial. Standard tools such as Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, and Regression models are routinely used in such analysis, but they either rely on a pairwise correlation matrix, assume specific (conditional) probability distributions, or assume that the survey data lies in a linear subspace. Recent advances in manifold learning techniques have demonstrated better detection of different behavioural regimes from surveys. This paper uses Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation Survey data to compare three non-linear manifold techniques: Fisher Information Non-Parametric Embedding (FINE), Diffusion Maps and t-SNE. Using a simulation framework, we show that FINE appears to consistently outperform the other methods except for questionnaires with high multi-partite information. Although not limited by the need to impose a grouping scheme on data, t-SNE and Diffusion Maps require hyperparameter tuning and thus more computational effort, unlike FINE which is non-parametric. Finally, we demonstrate FINE’s ability to detect adaptation regimes and corresponding key drivers from high-dimensional data.}

	abstract = {Tracking the evolution of discussions on online social spaces is essential to assess populations’ main tendencies and concerns worldwide. This paper investigates the relationship between topic evolution and speech toxicity on Twitter. We construct a Dynamic Topic Evolution Model (DyTEM) based on a corpus of collected tweets. To build DyTEM, we leverage a combination of traditional static Topic Modelling approaches and sentence embeddings using sBERT, a state-of-the-art sentence transformer. The DyTEM is represented as a directed graph. Then, we propose a hashtag-based method to validate the consistency of the DyTEM and provide guidance for the hyperparameter selection. Our study identifies five evolutionary steps or Topic Transition Types: Topic Stagnation, Topic Merge, Topic Split, Topic Disappearance, and Topic Emergence. We utilize a speech toxicity classification model to analyze toxicity dynamics in topic evolution, comparing the Topic Transition Types in terms of their toxicity. Our results reveal a positive correlation between the popularity of a topic and its toxicity, with no statistically significant difference in the presence of inflammatory speech among the different transition types. These findings, along with the methods introduced in this paper, have broader implications for understanding and monitoring the impact of topic evolution on the online discourse, which can potentially inform interventions and policy-making in addressing toxic behavior in digital communities.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable. We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA. Our approach can be extended to validate synthetic networks created for multiple infrastructures such as transportation, communication, water, and gas networks.}

	abstract = {As the demand for electric vehicles continues to surge worldwide, it becomes increasingly imperative for the government to plan and anticipate its practical impact on society. In particular, any city/state needs to guarantee sufficient and proper placement of charging stations to service all current/future electric vehicle adopters. Furthermore, it needs to consider the inevitable additional strain these charging stations put on the existing power grid. In this paper, we use data-driven models to address these issues by providing an algorithm that finds optimal placement and connections of electric vehicle charging stations in the state of Virginia. Specifically, we found it suffices to build 10,733 additional charging stations to cover \\(75\\%\\) of the population within 0.33\xa0miles (and everyone within 2.5\xa0miles). We also show optimally connecting the stations to the power grid significantly improves the stability of the network. Additionally, we study 1) the trade-off between the average distance a driver needs to travel to their nearest charging station versus the number of stations to build, and 2) the impact on the grid under various adoption rates. These studies provide further insight into various tools policymakers can use to prepare for the evolving future.}

	abstract = {Neural networks perform very well on difficult problems such as image or speech recognition as well as machine text translation. Classification based on fragmented and dispersed data representing certain properties of images or computer’s vision is a complex problem. Here, the suitability of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network was evaluated using fragmented data in the problem of recognizing objects in images. The great difficulty of the considered problem is, there is not images data as such but only data on some properties of images stored in a dispersed form. More specifically, it was demonstrated that applying a \\(k-\\)nearest neighbors classifier in the first step to generate predictions based on fragmented data, and then using a RBF neural network to learn how to correctly recognize the systems of generated predictions for making a final classification is a good approach for recognizing objects in images. An additional step of training the weights (centers) between the input and hidden layers of a RBF network was proposed. In general, this investigation demonstrates that adding this step significantly improves the correctness of recognizing objects in images.}

	abstract = {Processing of deforming shapes represented by sequences of triangle meshes with connectivity varying in time is difficult, because of the lack of temporal correspondence information, which makes it hard to exploit the temporal coherence. Establishing surface correspondence is not an easy task either, especially since some surface patches may have no corresponding counterpart in some frames, due to self-contact. Previously, it has been shown that establishing sparse correspondence via tracking volume elements might be feasible, however, previous methods suffer from severe drawbacks, which lead to tracking artifacts that compromise the applicability of the results. In this paper, we propose a new, temporally global optimisation step, which allows to improve the intermediate results obtained via forward tracking. Together with an improved formulation of volume element affinity and a robust means of identifying and removing tracking irregularities, the procedure yields a substantially better model of temporal volume correspondence.}

	abstract = {Deep learning was used to detect boulders that can damage excavators in opencast mines. Different network architectures were applied, i.e., modern YOLOv5, RetinaNet and Mask-RCNN. Studies were carried out in which the results obtained using a few networks were compared. The abovementioned neural networks were exploited in a framework for detection of oversized boulders on a conveyor belt operating in an opencast coal mine. The method is based on the analysis of a certain number of consecutive frames of the film from an industrial camera. The novelty relies on checking the detection of a boulder within subsequent frames and allowing the skipping of a prescribed small number of neighboring frames with false negative detections. This allows one to make a decision about stopping a conveyor belt after detecting a boulder in consecutive frames even when they are interleaved with frames that contained a boulder missed by a detector due to misleading environmental conditions such as shadows or sand. The method was tested on recordings from an opencast mine in Poland. The proposed method can help prevent the failure of expensive equipment.}

	abstract = {Many machine learning models are applied on facial expression classification and there are three main issues affecting the performance of any algorithms in classifying emotions based on facial expressions, and these issues include image illumination, image quality and partial features recognition. Many approaches have been proposed to handle these issues. Unfortunately, one of the main challenges in detecting and classifying facial expression process is minimal differences of features between different types of emotions that can be used to differentiate these different types of emotions. Thus, there is a need to enrich each type of emotion with more relevant extracted features by having a more effective approach to extract features that can be used to represent each type of emotions more effectively and efficiently. This work addresses the issue of improving the emotion recognition accuracy by introducing a novel hybrid approach that combines the Depth Active Appearance Model (DAAM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). The proposed DAAM and DCNNs model can be used to assist one in identifying emotions and classify learner involvement and interest in the topic which are plotted as feedback to the instructor to improve learner experience. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets namely, JAFFE and CK+ and the results are compared to the state-of-the-art results. The empirical study showed that the proposed DAMM-CNNs hybrid method managed to perform the face expression recognition with 97.4% for the JAFFE dataset and 96.9% for the CK+ dataset.}

	abstract = {League of Legends (LoL) is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game with over 160 champions and a competitive esports scene. The ban-and-pick system allows players to choose champions before a match, which can greatly impact the outcome, especially in professional leagues. This article presents an overview of the development of a champion recommendation system for League of Legends, with a focus on the evaluation and comparison of multiple machine learning models. Our system offers real-time recommendations during the pick and ban phase, utilizing data from professional and high-level games. The accuracy and performance of the various models are analyzed and presented, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in solving the task of champion recommendation. Results show that the player’s statistics on a champion are the biggest determinants of a game’s outcome.}

	abstract = {Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer. In its modification called ELM Radial Basis Function the input data is a priori clustered into a number of sets represented by their centroids. The matrix of distances between each sample and centroid is calculated and applied as input data to the neural network. This work conducts a comparison study of the ELM Radial Basis Function classification performance upon applying either k-means, k-medoids or mean shift clustering methods. Generated results are obtained from two datasets i.e. Wine Quality-White and Ionosphere. The computations are based on full datasets or on the same both sets reduced by a feature selection algorithm. The parameters of the classifiers such as number of neurons in hidden layer, the value of k in k-means and k-medoids, the value of radius in mean shift are optimized through an iterative procedure upon maximizing an accuracy or minimizing Mean Square Error and computation time. The different distance metrics for k-means and k-medoids, and mean shift with Gaussian or flat kernel function are also compared. The results obtained with Softplus and linear activation function (applied in most of the computations in this work) are juxtaposed with the results generated by other activation functions.}

	abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) like other Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and data processing tasks, requires a large amount of data to be effective. Thus, one of the most significant challenges confronting ML/DL tasks, including NLP, is a lack of data. This is especially noticeable in the case of text data for niche languages like Polish. Manual collection and labelling of text data is the primary method for obtaining language-specific data. However, this is a lengthy and labour-intensive process. As a result, researchers use a variety of other solutions, such as machine translation from another, more developed language in the field, to obtain data more quickly and affordably. For these reasons the suitable experiments, described in the paper, were carried out, resulting in a machine translation model that translates texts from English into Polish. Its results were compared with those of a pre-trained model and translations were subjected to human testing. Moreover, the paper presents the influence of different pre-processing stages on the final result of text classification in Polish in terms of one of six emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise.}

	abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRS) can dynamically capture user fine-grained preference by directly asking whether a user likes an attribute or not. However, like traditional recommender systems, accurately comprehending users’ preferences remains a critical challenge for CRS to make effective conversation policy decisions. While there have been various efforts made to improve the performance of CRS, they have neglected the impact of the users’ social context, which has been proved to be valuable in modeling user preferences and enhancing the performance of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a social-enhanced user preference estimation model (SocialCRS) to leverage the social context of users to better learn user embedding representation. Specifically, we construct a user-item-attribute heterogeneous graph and apply a graph convolution network (GCN) to learn the embeddings of users, items, and attributes. Another GCN is used on the user social context graph to learn the social embedding of users. To estimate better user preference, the attention mechanism is adopted to aggregate the embedding of the user’s friends. By aggregating these users’ embeddings, we obtain social-enhanced user preferences. Through extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets in a multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods.}

	abstract = {Deep learning and machine learning methods have been recently used in forest classification problems, and have shown significant improvement in terms of efficacy. However, as attributed from the literature, they have the challenge of having insufficient model variance and restricted generalization capabilities. The goal of this study is to improve the accuracy of forest image classification through the development of a hybrid model that incorporates both deep learning and machine learning techniques. This study has proposed an ensemble approach of the Deep Learning technique (ResNet50 in particular), and machine learning model (specifically XGBoost) to increase the prediction capability of classifying satellite forest images. The sole purpose of ResNet50 is to generate a set of features that will in turn be used by the XGBoost algorithm to perform the classification process. The XGBoost algorithm was compared against a fully connected ResNet50 model and other classifiers such as random forest (RF) and light gradient boost machine (LGBM). The best classification results were obtained from XGBoost (0.77), followed by RF (0.74), LGBM (0.73), and ResNet50 (0.59).}

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for estimating the radius of blood vessels using vesselness functions computed at multiple scales. The multiscale vesselness technique is commonly used to enhance blood vessels and reduce noise in angiographic images. The corrected and binarized image resulting from this technique is then used to construct a 3D vector model of the blood vessel tree. However, the accuracy of the model and consequently the accuracy of radii estimated from the model may be limited by the image voxel spacing. To improve the accuracy of the estimated vessel radii, the method proposed in this study makes use of the vesselness functions that are already available as by-products of the preceding enhancement procedure. This approach speeds up the estimation process and maintains sub-voxel accuracy. The proposed method was validated and compared with two other state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative comparison involved artificially generated images of tubes with known geometries, while the qualitative assessment involved analyzing a real magnetic resonance angiogram. The results obtained demonstrate the high accuracy and usefulness of the proposed method. The presented algorithm was implemented, and the source code was made freely available to support further research.}

It uses the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and methods for background/foreground detection. In order to evaluate the developed tracking algorithm, the dataset consisting of three simulation sequences and two real ones was prepared. The sequences contain from one to ten drones moving with different flight patterns. The simulation sequences were created using the Unreal Engine and the AirSim plugin, whereas the real sequences were registered in the Human Motion Lab at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. The lab is equipped with the Vicon motion capture system, which was used to acquire ground truth data. The conducted experiments show the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. For the simulation data, tracking errors from 0.086\xa0m to 0.197\xa0m were obtained, while for real data, the error was 0.101–0.124\xa0m. The system was developed for augmented reality applications, especially games. The dataset is available at http://bytom.pja.edu.pl/drones/.}

We leverage data collected by the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager using the SunPy and PyTorch libraries to create a vector-based mathematical representation of the Sun’s magnetic field regions. This approach enables us to compare short vectors instead of comparing full-disk images. To reduce retrieval time, we use a fully-connected autoencoder to compress the 144-element descriptor to a 36-element semantic hash. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, which achieved the highest precision value compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed method is not only applicable for solar image retrieval but also for classification tasks.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel architecture of a convolutional neural network designed for the segmentation of intracranial arteries in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA). The proposed architecture is based on the V-Net model, however, with substantial modifications in the bottleneck and the decoder part. In order to leverage multiscale characteristics of the input vessel patterns, we postulate to pass the network embeddings generated on the encoder path output through the atrous spatial pyramid pooling block. We motivate that this mechanism allows the decoder part to rebuild the segmentation mask based on local features, however, determined at various ranges of voxels neighborhoods. The ASPP outputs are aggregated using a simple gated recurrent unit which, on the other hand, facilitates the learning of feature maps’ relevance with respect to the final output. We also propose to enrich the global context information provided to the decoder by including a vessel-enhancement block responsible for filtering out background tissues. In this study, we also aimed to verify if it is possible to train an effective deep-learning vessel segmentation model based solely on synthetic data. For that purpose, we reconstructed 30 realistic cerebral arterial tree models and used our previously developed MRA simulation framework.}

	abstract = {Let a three-dimensional ball intersect a three-dimensional polyhedron given by its triangulated boundary with outward unit normals. We propose a numerical method for approximate computation of the intersection volume by using voxelization of the interior of the polyhedron. The approximation error is verified by comparison with the exact volume of the polyhedron provided by the Gauss divergence theorem. Voxelization of the polyhedron interior is achieved by the aid of an indicator function, which is very similar to the signed distance to the boundary of the polyhedron. The proposed numerical method can be used in 3D quantification of glenoid bone loss.}

	abstract = {Reverse engineering is one of the classical approaches for quailty assessment in industrial manufacturing. A key technology in reverse engineering is surface reconstruction, which aims at obtaining a digital model of a physical object from a cloud of 3D data points obtained by scanning the object. In this paper we address the surface reconstruction problem for surfaces that can exhibit large smooth bumps. To account for this type of features, our approach is based on using exponentials of polynomial functions in two variables as the approximating functions. In particular, we consider three different models, given by bivariate distributions obtained by combining a normal univariate distribution with a normal, Gamma, and Weibull distribution, respectively. The resulting surfaces depend on some parameters whose values have to be optimized. This yields a difficult nonlinear continuous optimization problem solved through an artificial immune systems approach based on the clonal selection theory. The performance of the method is discussed through its application to a benchmark comprised of three examples of point clouds.}

	abstract = {Abrupt and rapid high-amplitude changes in a dynamical system’s states known as extreme events appear in many processes occurring in nature, such as drastic climate patterns, rogue waves, or avalanches. These events often entail catastrophic effects, therefore their description and prediction is of great importance. However, because of their chaotic nature, their modelling represents a great challenge up to this day. The applicability of a data-driven modularity-based clustering technique to identify precursors of rare and extreme events in chaotic systems is here explored. The proposed identification framework based on clustering of system states, probability transition matrices and state space tessellation was developed and tested on two different chaotic systems that exhibit extreme events: the Moehliss-Faisst-Eckhardt model of self-sustained turbulence and the 2D Kolmogorov flow. Both exhibit extreme events in the form of bursts in kinetic energy and dissipation. It is shown that the proposed framework provides a way to identify pathways towards extreme events and predict their occurrence from a probabilistic standpoint. The clustering algorithm correctly identifies the precursor states leading to extreme events and allows for a statistical description of the system’s states and its precursors to extreme events.}

	abstract = {Turbulence is characterised by chaotic dynamics and a high-dimensional state space, which make this phenomenon challenging to predict. However, turbulent flows are often characterised by coherent spatiotemporal structures, such as vortices or large-scale modes, which can help obtain a latent description of turbulent flows. However, current approaches are often limited by either the need to use some form of thresholding on quantities defining the isosurfaces to which the flow structures are associated or the linearity of traditional modal flow decomposition approaches, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition. This problem is exacerbated in flows that exhibit extreme events, which are rare and sudden changes in a turbulent state. The goal of this paper is to obtain an efficient and accurate reduced-order latent representation of a turbulent flow that exhibits extreme events. Specifically, we employ a three-dimensional multiscale convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to obtain such latent representation. We apply it to a three-dimensional turbulent flow. We show that the Multiscale CAE is efficient, requiring less than 10% degrees of freedom than proper orthogonal decomposition for compressing the data and is able to accurately reconstruct flow states related to extreme events. The proposed deep learning architecture opens opportunities for nonlinear reduced-order modeling of turbulent flows from data.}

Recently, graph-based architectures have been proven to be especially suitable for molecular systems. However, the construction of robust and transferable potentials, resulting in stable dynamical trajectories, still needs to be researched. In this work, we design and compare several neural architectures with different graph convolutional layers to predict the energy of water cluster anions, a system of fundamental interest in chemistry and biology. After identifying the best aggregation procedures for this problem, we have obtained accurate, fast-evaluated and easy-to-implement graph neural network models which could be employed in dynamical simulations in the future.}

	abstract = {We introduce a gradient-free data-driven framework for optimizing the power output of a wind farm based on a Bayesian approach and large-eddy simulations. In contrast with conventional wind farm layout optimization strategies, which make use of simple wake models, the proposed framework accounts for complex flow phenomena such as wake meandering, local speed-ups and the interaction of the wind turbines with the atmospheric flow. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated for the case of a small wind farm consisting of five wind turbines. It is shown that it can find optimal designs within a few iterations, while leveraging the above phenomena to deliver increased wind farm performance.}

	abstract = {In the last decade, the scientific community has devolved its attention to the deployment of data-driven approaches in scientific research to provide accurate and reliable analysis of a plethora of phenomena. Most notably, Physics-informed Neural Networks and, more recently, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) proved to be effective both in system integration and identification. However, there is a lack of an in-depth analysis of the proposed techniques. In this work, we make a contribution by testing the UDE framework in the context of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) discovery. In our analysis, performed on two case studies, we highlight some of the issues arising when combining data-driven approaches and numerical solvers, and we investigate the importance of the data collection process. We believe that our analysis represents a significant contribution in investigating the capabilities and limitations of Physics-informed Machine Learning frameworks.}

	abstract = {The reconstruction of gap-free signals from observation data is a critical challenge for numerous application domains, such as geoscience and space-based earth observation, when the available sensors or the data collection processes lead to irregularly-sampled and noisy observations. Optimal interpolation (OI), also referred to as kriging, provides a theoretical framework to solve interpolation problems for Gaussian processes (GP). The associated computational complexity being rapidly intractable for n-dimensional tensors and increasing numbers of observations, a rich literature has emerged to address this issue using ensemble methods, sparse schemes or iterative approaches. Here, we introduce a neural OI scheme. It exploits a variational formulation with convolutional auto-encoders and a trainable iterative gradient-based solver. Theoretically equivalent to the OI formulation, the trainable solver asymptotically converges to the OI solution when dealing with both stationary and non-stationary linear spatio-temporal GPs. Through a bi-level optimization formulation, we relate the learning step and the selection of the training loss to the theoretical properties of the OI, which is an unbiased estimator with minimal error variance. Numerical experiments for 2d+t synthetic GP datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed scheme to learn computationally-efficient and scalable OI models and solvers from data. As illustrated for a real-world interpolation problems for satellite-derived geophysical dynamics, the proposed framework also extends to non-linear and multimodal interpolation problems and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation methods, when dealing with very high missing data rates.}

	abstract = {We present the physics-informed long short-term memory (PI-LSTM) network to reconstruct and predict the evolution of unmeasured variables in a chaotic system. The training is constrained by a regularization term, which penalizes solutions that violate the system’s governing equations. The network is showcased on the Lorenz-96 model, a prototypical chaotic dynamical system, for a varying number of variables to reconstruct. First, we show the PI-LSTM architecture and explain how to constrain the differential equations, which is a non-trivial task in LSTMs. Second, the PI-LSTM is numerically evaluated in the long-term autonomous evolution to study its ergodic properties. We show that it correctly predicts the statistics of the unmeasured variables, which cannot be achieved without the physical constraint. Third, we compute the Lyapunov exponents of the network to infer the key stability properties of the chaotic system. For reconstruction purposes, adding the physics-informed loss qualitatively enhances the dynamical behaviour of the network, compared to a data-driven only training. This is quantified by the agreement of the Lyapunov exponents. This work opens up new opportunities for state reconstruction and learning of the dynamics of nonlinear systems.}

	abstract = {The study concerns classification based on dispersed data, more specifically data collected independently in many local decision tables. The paper proposes an approach in which coalitions of local tables are generated using Pawlak’s conflict analysis model. Decision trees are built based on tables aggregated within the coalitions The paper examines the impact of the stop criterion (determined by the number of objects in a node) on the quality classification and on the rules’ quality generated by the model. The results are compared with the baseline approach, in which decision trees are built independently based on each of the decision tables. The paper shows that using the proposed model, the generated decision rules have much greater confidence than the rules generated by the baseline method. In addition, the proposed model gives better classification quality regardless of the stop criterion compared to the non-coalitions approach. Moreover, the use of higher values of the stop criterion for the proposed model significantly reduces the length of the rules while maintaining the classification accuracy and the rules’ confidence at a high level.}

The overarching objective of this paper is to compute the stability properties of a chaotic dynamical system, which is time-delayed. The stability analysis is based only on data. We employ the echo state network (ESN), a type of recurrent neural network, and train it on timeseries of a prototypical time-delayed nonlinear thermoacoustic system. By running the trained ESN autonomously, we show that it can reproduce (i) the long-term statistics of the thermoacoustic system’s variables, (ii) the physical portion of the Lyapunov spectrum, and (iii) the statistics of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This work opens up the possibility to infer stability properties of time-delayed systems from experimental observations.}

While the former focuses on system state estimation, the latter provides great inductive biases to learn complex relationships. We here design a hybrid architecture learning the assimilation task directly from partial and noisy observations, using the mechanistic constraint of the 4DVAR\xa0algorithm. Finally, we show in an experiment that the proposed method was able to learn the desired inversion with interesting regularizing properties and that it also has computational interests.}

	abstract = {In the field of large-scale field reconstruction, Kriging has been a commonly used technique for spatial interpolation at unobserved locations. However, Kriging’s effectiveness is often restricted when dealing with non-Gaussian or non-stationary real-world fields, and it can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, supervised deep learning models can potentially address these limitations by capturing underlying patterns between observations and corresponding fields. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning model that utilizes vision transformers and autoencoders for large-scale field reconstruction. The new model is named ViTAE. The proposed model is designed specifically for large-scale and complex field reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ViTAE over Kriging. Additionally, the proposed ViTAE model runs more than 1000 times faster than Kriging, enabling real-time field reconstructions.}

	abstract = {Data assimilation methods are mainly based on the Bayesian formulation of the estimation problem. For cost and feasibility reasons, this formulation is usually approximated by Gaussian assumptions on the distribution of model variables, observations and errors. However, when these assumptions are not valid, this can lead to non-convergence or instability of data assimilation methods. The work presented here introduces the use of kernel methods in data assimilation to model uncertainties in the data in a more flexible way than with Gaussian assumptions. The use of kernel functions allows to describe non-linear relationships between variables. The aim is to extend the assimilation methods to problems where they are currently unefficient. The Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) formulation of the assimilation problem is reformulated using kernels and show the equivalence of the two formulations for the linear kernel. Numerical results on the toy model Lorenz 63 are provided for the linear and hyperbolic tangent kernels and compared to the results obtained by the ETKF showing the potential for improvement.}

	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating physical laws into the models. The partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals are minimized on a set of collocation points which distribution appears to have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Learning (FBOAL) method, which decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The numerical results obtained with FBOAL demonstrate important gains in terms of the accuracy and computational cost of PINNs with FBOAL for non-parameterized and parameterized problems. We also apply FBOAL in a complex industrial application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields.}

	abstract = {Data generated by manufacturing processes can often be represented as a data stream. The main characteristics of these data are that it is not possible to store all the data in memory, the data are generated continuously at high speeds, and it may evolve over time. These characteristics of the data make it impossible to use ordinary machine learning techniques. Specially crafted methods are necessary to deal with these problems, which are capable of assimilation of new data and dynamic adjustment of the model. In this work, we consider a cold rolling mill, which is one of the steps in steel strip manufacturing, and apply data stream methods to predict distribution of rolling forces based on the input process parameters. The model is then used for the purpose of anomaly detection during online production. Three different machine learning scenarios are tested to determine an optimal solution that fits the characteristics of cold rolling. The results have shown that for our use case the performance of the model trained offline deteriorates over time, and additional learning is required after deployment. The best performance was achieved when the batch learning model was re-trained using a data buffer upon concept drift detection. We plan to use the results of this investigation as a starting point for future research, which will involve more advanced learning methods and a broader scope in relation to the cold rolling process.}

	abstract = {The two-dimensional scattered data interpolation problem is investigated. In contrast to the traditional Method of Radial Basis Functions, the interpolation problem is converted to a higher order (biharmonic or modified bi-Helmholtz) partial differential equation supplied with usual boundary conditions as well as pointwise interpolation conditions. To solve this fourth-order problem, the Method of Fundamental Solutions is used. The source points, which are needed in the method, are located partly in the exterior of the domain of the corresponding partial differential equation and partly in the interpolation points. This results in a linear system with possibly large and fully populated matrix. To make the computations more efficient, a localization technique is applied, which splits the original problem into a sequence of local problems. The system of local equations is solved in an iterative way, which mimics the classical overlapping Schwarz method. Thus, the problem of large and ill-conditioned matrices is completely avoided. The method is illustrated via a numerical example.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we address a way to reduce the total computational cost of meshless approximation by reducing the required stencil size through spatially varying computational node regularity. Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation using solely monomial basis can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour. The performance of the proposed hybrid scattered-regular approximation approach, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution, is studied on natural convection driven fluid flow problems. We start with the solution of the de\xa0Vahl\xa0Davis benchmark case, defined on a square domain, and continue with two- and three-dimensional irregularly shaped domains. We show that the spatial variation of the two approximation methods can significantly reduce the computational demands, with only a minor impact on the accuracy.}

Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are then able to introduce a numerical quantity that indicates whether a given stencil size is locally optimal.}

	abstract = {The paper discusses various formulations of the recently developed higher order Multipoint Meshless Finite Difference Method. The novel multipoint approach is based on raising the order of approximation of the unknown function by introducing additional degrees of freedom in stencil nodes, taking into account e.g. the right hand side of the considered differential equation. It improves the finite difference solution without increasing the number of nodes in an arbitrary irregular mesh. In general, the standard version of the Meshless (Generalized) FDM is based on the strong problem formulation. The extensions of the multipoint meshless FDM allow for analysis of boundary value problems posed in various weak formulations, including variational ones (Galerkin, Petrov-Galerkin), minimization of the energy functional, and the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin. Several versions of the multipoint method are proposed and examined. The paper is illustrated with some examples of the multipoint numerical tests carried out for the weak formulations and their comparison with those obtained for the strong formulation.}

	abstract = {Molecular-continuum coupled flow simulations are used in many applications to build a bridge across spatial or temporal scales. Hence, they allow to investigate effects beyond flow scenarios modeled by any single-scale method alone, such as a discrete particle system or a partial differential equation solver. On the particle side of the coupling, often molecular dynamics (MD) is used to obtain trajectories based on pairwise molecule interaction potentials. However, since MD is computationally expensive and macroscopic flow quantities sampled from MD systems often highly fluctuate due to thermal noise, the applicability of molecular-continuum methods is limited. If machine learning (ML) methods can learn and predict MD based flow data, then this can be used as a noise filter or even to replace MD computations, both of which can generate tremendous speed-up of molecular-continuum simulations, enabling emerging applications on the horizon. In this paper, we develop an advanced hybrid ML model for MD data in the context of coupled molecular-continuum flow simulations: A convolutional autoencoder deals with the spatial extent of the flow data, while a recurrent neural network is used to capture its temporal correlation. We use the open source coupling tool MaMiCo to generate MD datasets for ML training and implement the hybrid model as a PyTorch-based filtering module for MaMiCo. It is trained with real MD data from different flow scenarios including a Couette flow validation setup and a three-dimensional vortex street. Our results show that the hybrid model is able to learn and predict smooth flow quantities, even for very noisy MD input data. We furthermore demonstrate that also the more complex vortex street flow data can accurately be reproduced by the ML module.}

	abstract = {Each year, natural disasters force millions of people to evacuate their homes and become internally displaced. Mass evacuations following a disaster can make it difficult for humanitarian organizations to respond properly and provide aid. To help predict the number of people who will require shelter, this study uses agent-based modelling to simulate flood-induced evacuations. We modified the Flee modelling toolkit, which was originally developed to simulate conflict-based displacement, to be used for flood-induced displacement. We adjusted the simulation parameters, updated the rule set, and changed the development approach to address the specific requirements of flood-induced displacement. We developed a test model, called DFlee, which includes new features, such as the simulation of internally displaced persons and returnees. We tested the model on a case study of a 2022 flood in Bauchi state, Nigeria, and validated the results against data from the International Organization for Migration’s Displacement Tracking Matrix. The model’s goal is to help humanitarian organizations prepare and respond more effectively to future flood-induced evacuations.}

	abstract = {This work suggests several methods of uncertainty treatment in multiscale modelling and describes their application to a system of coupled turbulent transport simulations of a tokamak plasma. We propose a method to quantify the usually aleatoric uncertainty of a system in a quasistationary state, estimating the mean values and their errors for quantities of interest, which is average heat fluxes in the case of turbulence simulations. The method defines the stationarity of the system and suggests a way to balance the computational cost of simulation and the accuracy of estimation. This allows, contrary to many approaches, to incorporate of aleatoric uncertainties in the analysis of the model and to have a quantifiable decision for simulation runtime. Furthermore, the paper describes methods for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a model and the results of such a procedure for turbulence simulations, identifying the model’s sensitivity to particular input parameters and sensitivity to uncertainties in total. Finally, we introduce a surrogate model approach based on Gaussian Process Regression and present a preliminary result of training and analysing the performance of such a model based on turbulence simulation data. Such an approach shows a potential to significantly decrease the computational cost of the uncertainty propagation for the given model, making it feasible on current HPC systems.}

To the best of our knowledge, no one has so far dealt with the use of RL techniques for graph edge coloring. The paper contains an adaptation of the method of Zhou et al. to the problem of finding specific Ramsey colorings. The proposed algorithm was tested by successfully finding critical colorings for selected known Ramsey numbers. The results of proposed algorithm are so promising that we may have a chance to find unknown Ramsey numbers.}

	abstract = {We present the analysis of the topological graph descriptor Local Degree Profile (LDP), which forms a widely used structural baseline for graph classification. Our study focuses on model evaluation in the context of the recently developed fair evaluation framework, which defines rigorous routines for model selection and evaluation for graph classification, ensuring reproducibility and comparability of the results. Based on the obtained insights, we propose a new baseline algorithm called Local Topological Profile (LTP), which extends LDP by using additional centrality measures and local vertex descriptors. The new approach provides the results outperforming or very close to the latest GNNs for all datasets used. Specifically, state-of-the-art results were obtained for 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets. We also consider computational aspects of LDP-based feature extraction and model construction to propose practical improvements affecting execution speed and scalability. This allows for handling modern, large datasets and extends the portfolio of benchmarks used in graph representation learning. As the outcome of our work, we obtained LTP as a simple to understand, fast and scalable, still robust baseline, capable of outcompeting modern graph classification models such as Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN). We provide open-source implementation at GitHub.}

	abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in computational sciences with extensive applications in various fields. The most commonly used methods are the algorithms designed to maximize modularity over different partitions of the network nodes. Using 80 real and random networks from a wide range of contexts, we investigate the extent to which current heuristic modularity maximization algorithms succeed in returning maximum-modularity (optimal) partitions. We evaluate (1) the ratio of the algorithms’ output modularity to the maximum modularity for each input graph, and (2) the maximum similarity between their output partition and any optimal partition of that graph. We compare eight existing heuristic algorithms against an exact integer programming method that globally maximizes modularity. The average modularity-based heuristic algorithm returns optimal partitions for only 19.4% of the 80 graphs considered. Additionally, results on adjusted mutual information reveal substantial dissimilarity between the sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partition of the networks in our experiments. More importantly, our results show that near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of commonly used modularity-based heuristics for discovering communities: they rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, exact or approximate optimization algorithms are recommendable for a more methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits.}

A suggested solution to this situation is the effective diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs). Regulations in the European Union aim to encourage consumers to buy electric cars. In addition, car manufacturers are constantly expanding their range of hybrid vehicles (HEVs) and EVs. Nonetheless, consumers have still many doubts regarding adopting an EV. Our survey among social media users investigates the attitudes and readiness of consumers to adopt HEVs and EVs. To investigate the factors underlying consumers’ attitudes to such vehicles, Bayesian networks were used as an exploratory tool. This paper presents results of this analysis.}

While the literature has focused on algorithms for global counts in simple graphs, this paper presents parallel algorithms for global and per-node triangle and square counts in large multigraphs. The algorithms have linear improvements in computational complexity as the number of cores increases. The triangle count algorithm has the same complexity as the best-known algorithm in the literature. The squares count algorithm has a lower execution time than previous methods. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on six real-world graphs and multigraphs, including protein-protein interaction graphs, knowledge graphs and large web graphs.}

	abstract = {Network community detection is a complex problem that has to utilize heuristic approaches. It often relies on optimizing partition quality functions, such as modularity, description length, stochastic block-model likelihood etc. However, direct application of the traditional optimization methods has limited efficiency in finding the global maxima in such tasks. This paper proposes a novel bi-partite attention graph neural network model for supervised and unsupervised network community detection, suitable for unsupervised optimization of arbitrary partition quality functions, as well as for minimization of a loss function against the provided partition in a supervised setting. The model is demonstrated to be helpful in the unsupervised improvement of suboptimal partitions previously obtained by other known methods like Louvain algorithm for some of the classic and synthetic networks. It is also shown to be efficient in supervised learning of the provided community structure for a set of classic and synthetic networks. Furthermore, the paper serves as a proof-of-concept for the broader application of graph neural network models to unsupervised network optimization.}
