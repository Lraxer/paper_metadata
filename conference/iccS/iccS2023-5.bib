	abstract = {Integer factorization and discrete logarithm problem, two problems of classical public-key cryptography, are vulnerable to quantum attacks, especially polynomial-time Shor’s algorithm, which has to be run on the general-purpose quantum computer. On the other hand, one can make quantum computations using quantum annealing, where every problem has to be transformed into an optimization problem, for example, the QUBO problem. Currently, the biggest available quantum annealer, D-Wave advantage, has almost 6,000 physical qubits, and therefore it can solve bigger problems than using general-purpose quantum computers. Even though it is impossible to run Shor’s algorithm on a quantum annealer, several methods allow one to transform factorization or discrete logarithm problems into the QUBO problem. Using a D-Wave quantum annealer, the biggest factored integer had 20 bits, and the biggest field, on which it was possible to compute a discrete logarithm problem using any quantum method, had 6 bits. This paper shows how to transform searching for B-smooth numbers, an important part of the quadratic sieve method for factorization and index calculus for solving discrete logarithm problems, to the QUBO problem and then solve it using D-Wave Advantage quantum solver. The linear algebra step for integer factorization and index calculus methods has been solved using classical computations. Using our method, we factorized the 26-bit integer and computed the discrete logarithm problem over the 18-bit prime field. Therefore we broke the current records in factorization using quantum annealing by 6 bits and in discrete logarithm problem, using any quantum method, by 12 bits.}

	abstract = {As quantum computers mature, the applicability in practice becomes more important. Quantum computers will often be used in a hybrid setting, where classical computers still play an important role in operating and using the quantum computer. However the term hybrid is diffuse and multi-interpretable. In this work we define two classes of hybrid quantum-classical computing: vertical and horizontal hybrid quantum-classical computing. The first is application-agnostic and concerns using and operating quantum computers. The second is application-specific and concerns running an algorithm. For both, we give a further subdivision in different types of hybrid quantum-classical computing and we introduce terms for them.}

	abstract = {\nBlack-box optimization (BBO) can be used to optimize functions whose analytic form is unknown. A common approach to realising BBO is to learn a surrogate model which approximates the target black-box function which can then be solved via white-box optimization methods. In this paper, we present our approach BOX-QUBO, where the surrogate model is a QUBO matrix. However, unlike in previous state-of-the-art approaches, this matrix is not trained entirely by regression, but mostly by classification between “good” and “bad” solutions. This better accounts for the low capacity of the QUBO matrix, resulting in significantly better solutions overall. We tested our approach against the state-of-the-art on four domains and in all of them BOX-QUBO showed better results. A second contribution of this paper is the idea to also solve white-box problems, i.e. problems which could be directly formulated as QUBO, by means of black-box optimization in order to reduce the size of the QUBOs to the information-theoretic minimum. Experiments show that this significantly improves the results for MAX-k-SAT.}

	abstract = {\nAnalysing properties of ground state of a quantum systems, is an important problem with applications in various domains. Recently, Huang et al. [2021] demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be used to efficiently solve this problem with formal guarantees. However this method requires an exponential amount of data to train. In this work we show a method with improved efficiency for a wide class of energy operator. In particular, we show an ML-based method for predicting ground state properties for structured Hamiltonian with sub-exponential scaling in training data. The method relies on efficiently learning low-degree approximation of the energy operator.}

	abstract = {\nDue to the physics behind quantum computing, quantum circuit designers must adhere to the constraints posed by the limited interaction distance of qubits. Existing circuits need therefore to be modified via the insertion of SWAP gates, which alter the qubit order by interchanging the location of two qubits’ quantum states. We consider the Nearest Neighbor Compliance problem on a linear array, where the number of required SWAP gates is to be minimized. We introduce an Integer Linear Programming model of the problem of which the size scales polynomially in the number of qubits and gates. Furthermore, we solve 131 benchmark instances to optimality using the commercial solver CPLEX. The benchmark instances are substantially larger in comparison to those evaluated with exact methods before. The largest circuits contain up to 18 qubits or over 100 quantum gates. This formulation also seems to be suitable for developing heuristic methods since (near) optimal solutions are discovered quickly in the search process.}

	abstract = {One of the first fields where quantum computing will likely show its use is optimisation. Many optimisation problems naturally arise in a quadratic manner, such as the quadratic knapsack problem. The current state of quantum computers requires these problems to be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem, or QUBO. Constrained quadratic binary optimisation can be translated into QUBOs by translating the constraint. However, this translation can be made in several ways, which can have a large impact on the performance when solving the QUBO. We show six different formulations for the quadratic knapsack problem and compare their performance using simulated annealing. The best performance is obtained by a formulation that uses no auxiliary variables for modelling the inequality constraint.}

The reasons for the choice of game type, design and mechanics, and the followed methodology are described in detail here. This paper also includes a preliminary study to determine the effect of the proposed game on the perception, interest and basic knowledge of quantum computing in a group of high school students.

The results presented in this paper were obtained using the QHyper framework, which we developed specifically for this purpose. More specifically, we use the created framework to compare the QAOA results with its two modifications, namely: Weight-Free QAOA (WF-QAOA) and Hyper QAOA (H-QAOA). Additionally, we compare the Basin-hopping global optimization method for subsequent sampling of the initial points for the proposed QAOA modifications with a simple Random Search. The results obtained for the Knapsack Problem indicate that the proposed solution outperforms the original QAOA algorithm and can be promising for QUBO, where adjusting the relative importance of the cost function and the constraints is a significant challenge.}

Though there are algorithmic solutions with high computational complexity available for this combinatorial optimization problem, it is unknown whether quantum-supported solutions may outperform classical algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum-supported solution for coalition structure generation in Induced Subgraph Games (ISGs). Our hybrid classical-quantum algorithm, called GCS-Q, iteratively splits a given n-agent graph game into two nonempty subsets in order to obtain a coalition structure with a higher coalition value. The GCS-Q solves the optimal split problem \\(\\mathcal {O}(n)\\) times, exploring \\(\\mathcal {O}(2^n)\\) partitions at each step. In particular, the optimal split problem is reformulated as a QUBO and executed on a quantum annealer, which is capable of providing the solution in linear time with respect to n. We show that GCS-Q outperforms the currently best classical and quantum solvers for coalition structure generation in ISGs with its runtime in the order of \\(n^2\\) and an expected approximation ratio of \\(93\\%\\) on standard benchmark datasets.}

	abstract = {Quantum Annealing is an optimization process taking advantage of quantum tunneling to search for the global optimum of an optimization problem, although, being a heuristic method, there is no guarantee to find the global optimum. Optimization problems solved by a Quantum Annealer machine are modeled as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (qubo) problems. Combinatorial optimization problems, where variables take discrete values and the optimization is under constraints, can also be modeled as qubo problems to benefit from Quantum Annealing power. However, defining quadratic penalty functions representing constraints within the qubo framework can be a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from data constraint representations as a combination of patterns we isolated in \\(Q\\) matrices modeling optimization problems and their constraint penalty functions. We actually model this learning problem as a combinatorial optimization problem itself. We propose two experimental protocols to illustrate the strengths of our method: its scalability, where correct pattern combinations learned over data from a small constraint instance scale to large instances of the same constraint, and its robustness, where correct pattern combinations can be learned over very scarce data, composed of about 10 training elements only.}

	abstract = {The growing availability of quantum computers raises questions about their ability to solve concrete problems. Existing benchmark protocols still lack problem diversity and attempt to summarize quantum advantage in a single metric that measures the quality of found solutions. Unfortunately, the solution quality metric is insufficient for measuring quantum algorithm performance and should be presented along with time and instances coverage metrics. This paper aims to establish the TAQOS protocol to perform a Tight Analysis of Quantum Optimization Systems. The combination of metrics considered by this protocol helps to identify problems and instances liable to produce quantum advantage on Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices for useful applications. The methodology used for the benchmark process is detailed and an illustrative short case study on the Max-Cut problem is provided.}

	abstract = {One of the major issues for building a complete quantum neural network is the implementation of non-linear activation functions in a quantum computer. In fact, the postulates of quantum mechanics impose only unitary transformations on quantum states, which is a severe limitation for quantum machine learning algorithms. Recently, the idea of QSplines has been proposed to approximate non-linear quantum activation functions by means of the HHL. However, QSplines rely on a problem formulation to be represented as a block diagonal matrix and need a fault-tolerant quantum computer to be correctly implemented. This work proposes two novel methods for approximating non-linear quantum activation functions using variational quantum algorithms. Firstly, we develop the variational QSplines (VQSplines) that allow overcoming the highly demanding requirements of the original QSplines and approximating non-linear functions using near-term quantum computers. Secondly, we propose a novel formulation for QSplines, the Generalized QSplines (GQSplines), which provide a more flexible representation of the problem and are suitable to be embedded in existing quantum neural network architectures. As a third meaningful contribution, we implement VQSplines and GQSplines using Pennylane to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in approximating typical non-linear activation functions in a quantum computer.}

Machine learning approaches can be enhanced using quantum algorithms and work effectively, as demonstrated in this paper. We present our experimental attempts to explore Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) capabilities and test their performance on the collected well-known images of handwritten digits for image classification called the MNIST benchmark. A variational quantum circuit was adopted to build the quantum kernel matrix and successfully applied to the classical SVM algorithm. The proposed model obtained relatively high accuracy, up to 99%, tested on noiseless quantum simulators. Finally, we performed computational experiments on real and recently setup IBM Quantum systems and achieved promising results of around 80% accuracy, demonstrating and discussing the QSVM applicability and possible future improvements.\n}

In this paper, we propose a methodology for efficiently estimating the quality of such approaches by rapidly – and practically in constant time – generating good lower bounds on the optimal value of the objective function using a quantum machine, which can be an excellent benchmark for comparing approximate algorithms. Another natural application is to use the proposed approach in the construction of exact algorithms based on the Branch and Bound method to obtain real optimal solutions.}

	abstract = {Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is one of the most popular quantum supremacy protocols as it does not require universal control over the quantum system, which favors current photonic experimental platforms and there is strong theoretical evidence for its computational hardness. However, over the years, several algorithms have been proposed trying to increase the performance of classically simulating GBS assuming certain constraints, e.g., a low number of photons or shallow interferometers. Most existing improvements of the classical simulation of GBS provide a performance increase regarding the probability calculation, leaving the sampling algorithm itself untouched. This paper provides an asymptotically better sampling algorithm in the case of low squeezing and shallow circuits.}

This case study considers the hypergraph partitioning problem, which is used to generate custom HOBO problems. Our experiments show that D-Wave systems quickly reach limits solving dense HOBO problems. Although the QAOA demonstrates better performance on exact simulations, noisy simulations reveal that the gate error rate should remain under \\(10^{-5}\\) to match D-Wave systems’ performance, considering equal compilation overheads for both device.}

Similarly to other design concepts, unitary designs are mainly used to facilitate averaging over a relevant space, in this case, the unitary group U(d). The most appealing case is when the elements of the design form a group, which in turn is called a unitary group design. However, the application of group designs as a tool is limited by the fact that there is no trivial construction method to get even a group 2-design for arbitrary dimensions. In this paper, we present novel construction methods, based on the representation theory of the unitary group and its subgroups, that allow the building of higher-order unitary designs from group designs.}

As numerical models, the model of the infected person who had a bifurcated airway and that of the exposed person who had an eighth-generation airway were prepared. The volume and number of virus-laden droplets adhered to the inlet patches of the exposed person’s lung were calculated to evaluate the risk of infection when the infected person was talking for 40 s. To identify the lung to which droplets adhered, we labeled the inlet patches of the exposed person’s lung with 53 numbers, and then measured the volume and number of droplets on the inlet patches of lung. We also categorized the lung’s 53 intake patches into five groups and calculated the overall volume and number of attached droplets for each. In addition, we parameterized the angle of the exposed person’s neck to evaluate the effect of the tilting neck on the volume and number of droplets reaching the lungs. We found that the volume and number of droplets adhered to the right middle group of bronchi were remarkably smaller than the other four groups, and weakly depended on the neck angle. The volume and number of droplets adhered to the inlet patches of the lung reached the maximum values when the neck angle was 20° upward.}

	abstract = {This work presents a Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM) for solving a single-phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous media. To discretize this problem, we first construct a fine-grid approximation using the Finite Element Method with a backward Euler time approximation. After time discretization, we use Newton’s method to handle the non-linearity in the resulting equations. To solve the linear system efficiently, we shall use the framework of CEM-GMsFEM by constructing multiscale basis functions on a suitable coarse-grid approximation. These basis functions are given by solving a class of local energy minimization problems over the eigenspaces that contain local information on heterogeneity. In addition, oversampling techniques provide exponential decay outside the corresponding local oversampling regions. Finally, we will provide two numerical experiments on a 3D case to show the performance of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {The multiple markers unstructured conservative level-set method for two-phase flow with variable surface tension is applied in the Direct Numerical Simulation of thermocapillary-migration of a bi-dispersed suspension of droplets. Surface tension is a function of temperature on the interface. Consequently, the called Marangoni stresses induced by temperature gradients on the interface lead to a coupling of the momentum transport equation with the thermal energy transport equation. The finite-volume method on three-dimensional collocated unstructured meshes discretizes the transport equations. Interface capturing is carried out by the unstructured conservative level-set method. The multiple marker approach avoids fluid particles’ numerical and potentially unphysical coalescence. The classical fractional-step projection method solves the pressure-velocity coupling. Unstructured flux limiters schemes solve the convective term of transport equations. Adaptive mesh refinement is incorporated to optimize computational resources. Verifications, validations and numerical findings are reported.}

	abstract = {Ion-induced volume phase transitions in polyelectrolyte gels play an important role in physiological processes such as mucus storage and secretion in the gut, nerve excitation, and DNA packaging. Experiments have shown that changes in ionic composition can trigger rapid swelling and deswelling of these gels. Based on a previously developed computational model, we carry out 2D simulations of gel deswelling within an ionic bath. The dynamics of the volume phase transition are governed by the balance of chemical and mechanical forces on components of the gel. Our simulation results highlight the close connections between the patterns of deswelling, the ionic composition, and the relative magnitude of particle-particle interaction energies.}

This paper first discusses synthesis procedures and properties of PLGA micro/nanoparticles (MPs/NPs) and then examine mechanisms of drug release from PLGA particles. For the core-shell structure of reservoir-type PLGA MPs/NPs, diffusion through the polymeric shell is identified as the main mechanism of drug release. A time-dependent diffusion equation is used to model release from homogeneous spherical particles. Finite volume schemes are developed for the radial diffusion model.

	abstract = {The nonmetallic pipes can effectively avoid the hydrogen embrittlement of metal pipes when transporting hydrogen. However, due to the characters of the nonmetal materials, there will be a large degree of gas permeation when conveying hydrogen by nonmetallic pipes. To select suitable nonmetal pipe materials, the solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of hydrogen in PE, PVC and PVDF amorphous polymers are investigated and compared by molecular dynamics simulations at 270–310\xa0K and 0.1–0.7\xa0MPa, providing guidance for the construction of nonmetallic hydrogen transportation pipes. Simulation results indicate that the solubility coefficients of hydrogen in PE and PVDF rise with the increasing temperature, but show an opposite trend in PVC. Both the diffusion and permeability coefficients increase with the rise of temperature. In a small range of pressure variation, the influence of pressure on diffusion and permeation characteristics is ignorable. Among the three studied amorphous polymers, the permeability coefficient of hydrogen in PE is the largest and that in PVDF is the smallest. In addition, the diffusion of hydrogen molecules in the polymer conforms to the hopping mechanism.}

	abstract = {Flash calculations of the hydrocarbon mixture are essential for determining how the mixture phase behaves, which will ultimately affect subsurface flow and transport. In this paper, a novel numerical scheme is proposed for calculating the two-phase equilibrium of Peng-Robinson (PR) fluid at constant volume, temperature, and moles, namely the volume-temperature (VT) flash framework based on the dynamic model. Since the dynamic model is based on the energy dissipation law and the Onsager’s reciprocal principle, we proposed a linear energy-stable scheme with the help of the convex-concave splitting technique, the energy factorization approach, and the component-wise iteration framework. The scheme eventually results in a fully explicit algorithm, and it avoids the challenges of solving non-linear systems and other difficulties in the traditional flash calculation methods. This scheme inherits the original energy stability and significantly reduces the implementation burden. It also achieves convergence unconditionally, even with a huge time step. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate its accuracy.}

	abstract = {As we move towards scenarios where the adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) becomes massive, smart solutions are required to efficiently solve conflicts in the flight trajectories of aircraft so as to avoid potential collisions. Among the different possible approaches, adopting virtual force fields is a possible solution acknowledged for being simple, distributed, and yet effective. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a directional force field (D-FFP) approach, preliminary assessing its performance benefits compared to a standard force field protocol (FFP) using Matlab simulation. Results show that, in typical scenarios associated with aerial traffic corridors, the proposed approach can reduce the flight time overhead by 32% (on average) while maintaining the required flight safety distances between aircraft.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of web applications, web attacks have become one of the major threats to cyberspace security. Many studies have focused on applying machine learning techniques for web attack traffic detection. However, past approaches suffer from two shortcomings: firstly, handcrafted feature extraction-based approaches are prone to introduce biases in existing perceptions, and secondly, current end-to-end deep learning approaches treat traffic payloads as non-structured string sequences ignoring their inherent structural characteristics. Therefore, we propose a graph-based web attack traffic detection model to identify the payloads in the traffic requests. Each pre-processed payload is transformed as an independent graph in which the node representations are shared through a global feature matrix. Finally, graph-level classification models are trained with graph attention networks combining global information. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets show that our approach successfully exploits local structural characteristics and global information to achieve state-of-the-art performance.}

	abstract = {In an industrial setting, predicting the remaining useful life-time of equipment and systems is crucial for ensuring efficient operation, reducing downtime, and prolonging the life of costly assets. There are state-of-the-art machine learning methods supporting this task. However, in this paper, we argue, that both efficiency and understandability can be improved by the use of explainable AI methods that analyze the importance of features used by the machine learning model. In the paper, we analyze the feature importance before a failure occurs to identify events in which an increase in importance can be observed and based on that indicate attributes with the most influence on the failure. We demonstrate how the analyses of Shap values near the occurrence of failures can help identify the specific features that led to the failure. This in turn can help in identifying the root cause of the problem and developing strategies to prevent future failures. Additionally, it can be used to identify areas where maintenance or replacement is needed to prevent failure and prolong the useful life of a system.}

	abstract = {Obstacles present serious risks and dangers for individuals who are blind or visually impaired (BVI), especially when they are not accompanied by a companion or assistant. In this study, we propose a head-mounted smart device to address this challenge. This study aims to establish a computationally efficient mechanism that can accurately detect the presence of obstacles on the path and provide warnings in real-time. The learned obstacle warning model needs to be reliable and small in size so that it can be embedded in the wearable device and run without consuming too much energy. Moreover, it must be able to deal with natural head turns, which can significantly impact readings from the head-mounted sensors. To determine the most appropriate model that can balance accuracy and real-time performance, we investigated more than thirty models and compared their key metrics. Our study demonstrates that a highly efficient wearable device is feasible and can help BVI individuals avoid obstacles with high accuracy. Additionally, we have collected a large data set that can serve as a benchmark for future studies in this area.}

In this context, this paper researches on building an Emotion Multi-modal Aggregator (EMmA) that will rely on a collection of open-source single source emotion classification methods aggregated to produce an emotion prediction. Although extendable, tested solution takes a video clip and divides into its frames and audio. Then a collection of primary classifiers are applied to each source and their results are combined in a final classifier utilizing machine learning aggregator techniques. The aggregator techniques that have been put to the test were Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors which, with an accuracy of 80%, have demonstrated superior performance over primary classifiers on the selected dataset.}

	abstract = {The use of information technologies in industry is growing year by year. More and more advanced devices are implemented and the software needed for them becomes more complex, which increases the risk of errors. To minimize them, it is necessary to constantly monitor the condition of the system and its components. This paper presents a part of a complex production support system for steel mill, responsible for monitoring and tracking the current state on the production hall. Data on currently performed melts and their condition, collected from two sensor layers - Level1 and Level2 - combining with a camera system that allows tracking the position of the main ladle in the hall, was used to create metamodel based on linear regression and neural network for the temperature drop which is occurring during the transport of liquid steel to the casting machine. This approach enables optimization of production volume and minimizes the risk associated with a temperature drop below the optimal one for casting. Several neural network models were used: YOLOv3 for object detection, CRAFT for text detection and CRNN for text recognition. This information is published to the sensor subsystem, enabling precise determination of the state of each performed melt. The system architecture, prediction accuracies and performance analysis were presented.}

	abstract = {The performance and driving range of electric vehicles are largely determined by the capabilities of their battery systems. To ensure optimal operation and protection of these systems, Battery Management Systems rely on key information such as State of Charge, State of Health, and sensor readings. These critical factors directly impact the range of electric vehicles and are essential for ensuring safe and efficient operation over the long term. This paper presents the development of a battery State of Charge estimation model based on a 1-D convolutional neural network. The data used to train this model are theoretical operating data as well as driving cycles of lithium-ion batteries. An Explainable Artificial Intelligence method is then applied to this model to verify the physical behavior of the black box model. Finally, a testing platform is currently under development to assess the effectiveness of the State of Charge estimation model. Our explainable model, called SocHAP, is compared to other contemporary methods to evaluate its predictive accuracy.}

	abstract = {As network scale expands and concurrent requests grow, unexpected network anomalies are more frequent, leading to service interruptions and degraded user experience. Real-time, accurate troubleshooting is critical for ensuring satisfactory service. Existing troubleshooting solutions adopt ensemble anomaly detection (EAD) to detect anomalies due to its robustness. However, the fixed base classifier parameters in EAD set by expert experience may reduce the efficiency of anomaly detection when faced with different data distributions. Furthermore, the binary results fed to the secondary classifier in EAD cause information loss, leading to compromised accuracy and inaccurate root cause localization. Besides, key performance indicators (KPIs) are crucial for measuring the system performance, but relying on multiple redundant KPIs to identify the root causes of anomalies is time-consuming and error-prone. To address the above issues, we propose a fully automatic troubleshooting system, ATS. A new EAD method is introduced to detect anomalies, then a module is designed to trigger the root cause localization. Specifically, the EAD method updates the parameters of base classifiers to dynamically adapt to different KPI data distributions. The ensemble of soft labels generated by base classifiers is subsequently fed into the secondary classifier to achieve information-lossless anomaly detection. Then, a heuristic module is proposed to select the most appropriate KPI data based on the metric i.e., bilayer relative difference to trigger the efficient root cause localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATS is more than twice as fast as most state-of-the-art solutions while with higher troubleshooting accuracy.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning method that is well-suited for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as it enables the training of machine learning models on distributed datasets. One of the most important advantages of using Federated Learning for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is its capability to optimize resource consumption. AGVs are typically resource-constrained systems and must operate within tight power and computational limits. By using Federated Learning, AGVs can perform model training and updating on-board, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper presents experiments to assess the consumption of resources of the Jetson Nano edge IoT device while training the Federated Learning model, and compares it with referential machine learning approaches.}

Hence, classifiers are trained to predict travel modes, such as the use of private cars vs bikes for individual journeys in the cities. In this work, we focus on parking-related factors to propose how survey data, including spatial data and origin-destination matrices of the transport model, can be transformed into features. Next, we propose how the impact of the newly proposed features on classifiers trained with different machine learning methods can be evaluated. Results of the extensive evaluation show that the features proposed in this study can significantly increase the accuracy of travel mode choice predictions.}

The system is based on the Internet of Things devices and Cloud Native techniques, which allow for measuring several environmental parameters like pollution, EMF pollution, and acoustic threats. In addition to these parameters, characteristic of environmental monitoring, the system has been enhanced with video monitoring techniques, such as evaluating the traffic intensity on the main roads and crowd detection. In particular, a front-end application was implemented to visualize the results on a city map. The system is deployed on Raspberry Pi and NVidia Jetson using Kubernetes as resources orchestrator. We managed to design, implement, and deploy a system that makes measurements and predicts the parameters indicated. The proposed solution has no significant impact on the energy consumption of the measuring stations while increasing the scalability and extensibility of the system.}

	abstract = {This paper presents methods of prediction of casting mechanical parameters based on direct microstructure image analysis using deep neural networks and graphite forms recognition and classification. These methods are applied to predict tensile strength of iron-carbon alloys based on microstructure photos taken with the light-optical microscopy technique, but are general and can be adapted to other applications. In the first approach EfficientNet architecture is used. In the second approach graphite structures are separated, recognized using VGG19 network, counted and classified using support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron and AdaBoost. Accuracy of the first approach is better. However, the second allows to create a classifier, for which the accuracy is also high, and can be easily analyzed by human expert.}

	abstract = {Today, android devices like smartphones, tablets, etc., have penetrated very deep into our modern society and have become an integral part of our daily lives. The widespread adoption of these devices has also garnered the immense attention of malware designers. Many recent reports suggest that existing malware detection systems cannot cope with current malware challenges and thus threaten the android ecosystem’s stability and security. Therefore, researchers are now turning towards android malware detection systems based on machine and deep learning algorithms, which have shown promising results. Despite their superior performance, these systems are not immune to adversarial attacks, highlighting a research gap in this field. Therefore, we design and develop EvoAAttack based on a genetic algorithm to expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art malware detection systems. The EvoAAttack is a targeted false-negative evasion attack strategy for the grey-box scenario. The EvoAAttack aims to convert malicious android applications (by adding perturbations) into adversarial applications that can deceive detection systems. The EvoAAttack agent is designed to convert maximum malware into adversarial applications with minimum perturbations while maintaining syntactic, semantic, and behavioral integrity. We tested EvoAAttack against thirteen distinct malware detection systems based on machine and deep learning algorithms from four different categories. The EvoAAttack was able to convert an average of \\(97.48\\%\\) of malware applications (with a maximum of five perturbations) into adversarial applications (malware variants). These adversarial applications force misclassifications and reduce the average accuracy of thirteen malware detection systems from \\(94.87\\%\\) to \\(50.31\\%\\). Later we also designed a defense strategy (defPCA) to counter the adversarial attacks. The defPCA defense reduces the average forced misclassification rate from \\(97.48\\%\\) to \\(59.98\\%\\) against the same thirteen malware detection systems. Finally, we conclude that threat modeling improves both detection performance and adversarial robustness of malware detection systems.}

	abstract = {Specific research programs, legislation and funding intend to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital, transforming the EU into a green, competitive, low-carbon and resource-efficient economy. These guidelines aim at protecting European citizens from health and environmental risks. Indeed, there is an increasing interest on decarbonization of the electricity generation, with a special focus on the introduction of Renewable Energy Resources (RES). This paper is a preliminary insight into a new control approach from where smart decision is made based on predictions returned by models of sustainable thermal systems (local renewable sources generation devices) and on information gathered from an array of sensors in order to regulate swimming pool’s water temperature. The information (ambient variables and sub-systems internal transfer function modelling) is then combined with an optimization framework which goal is to ultimately, reduce the requirements for human intervention in the swimming pool maintenance and provide resources savings for the final user in terms of financial and natural resources, contributing to a sustainable environment. The research work is developed within the scope of the Ecopool+++\u2009project: Innovative heated pools with reduced thermal losses.}

	abstract = {We consider a novel modeling and computational framework of the distributionally-robust optimization problem of jump-driven general affine process focusing on its application to inland fisheries as a case study. In particular, we consider an exploitation problem of migrating fish population as a major fishery issue. Our target process is the superposition of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes (supOU process) serving as a fundamental model of mean-reverting phenomena with (sub-)exponential memory. It is an affine process and admits a closed-form characteristic function being useful in applications. A theoretical novelty here is the assumption that the supOU process is allowed to have uncertain model parameter values as often encountered in engineering applications. Another novelty is the formulation of a long-term exploitation problem of the supOU process where the uncertainty is penalized through a generalized divergence between benchmark and distorted models. We present a strictly convex discretization of the optimization problem based on the model identified using the existing data of migrating fish population of a river in Japan. Further, the statistical analysis results in this paper are new by themselves. The computational results suggest the optimal harvesting policy of the fish population.}

	abstract = {Traditional global sensitivity analysis (GSA) techniques, such as variance- and density-based approaches, are limited in cases where a comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics is critical, especially for models with diverse timescales and structural complexity, such as system dynamics and agent-based models (ABMs). To address this, we propose a novel manifold learning-based method for GSA in systems exhibiting complex spatiotemporal processes. Our method employs Grassmannian diffusion maps to reduce the dimensionality of the data and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to map stochastic input parameters to diffusion coordinates of the reduced space. We calculate sensitivity indices from PCE coefficients, aggregating multiple outputs and their entire trajectories for a more general estimation of parameter sensitivities. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach by applying it to the Lotka-Volterra model and an epidemic dynamics ABM and capturing diverse temporal dynamics. We establish that the new methodology meets all “good” properties of a global sensitivity measure, making it a valuable alternative to traditional GSA techniques. We anticipate that it will potentially expand the application of manifold-based approaches and deepen the understanding of complex spatiotemporal processes.}

	abstract = {This paper investigated the possibility of obtaining fuzzy solutions to boundary problems using the interval parametric integral equations system (IPIES) method. It focused on the IPIES method because, thanks to the analytical modification of the boundary integral equations (BIE), it does not require classical discretization. In this method, an original modification of directed interval arithmetic was also proposed. Solutions obtained using classical and directed interval arithmetic (known from the literature) were also presented for comparison. The extension of the IPIES method (to obtain fuzzy solutions) was to divide the fuzzy number into \\(\\alpha \\)-cuts (depending on the assumed confidence level). Then, such \\(\\alpha \\)-cuts were represented as interval numbers. Preliminary tests were carried out in which the influence of boundary condition uncertainty on fuzzy solutions (obtained using IPIES) was investigated. The analysis of solutions was presented on examples described by Laplace’s equation. The accuracy verification of the fuzzy PIES solutions required a modification of known, exactly defined analytical solutions. They were defined using intervals and calculated using appropriate interval arithmetic in \\(\\alpha \\)-cuts to obtain fuzzy analytical solutions finally. The research showed the high accuracy of fuzzy solutions obtained using IPIES and confirmed the high potential of the method in obtaining such solutions.}

	abstract = {In this work, we introduce and study a set of tree-based algorithms for resources allocation considering group dependencies between their parameters. Real world distributed and high-performance computing systems often operate under conditions of the resources availability uncertainty caused by uncertainties of jobs execution, inaccuracies in runtime predictions and other global and local utilization events. In this way we can observe an availability over time function for each resource and use it as a scheduling parameter. As a single parallel job usually occupies a set of resources, they shape groups with common probabilities of usage and release events. The novelty of the proposed approach is an efficient algorithm considering groupings of resources by the common availability probability for the resources’ co-allocation. The proposed algorithm combines dynamic programming and greedy methods for the probability-based multiplicative knapsack problem with a tree-based branch and bounds approach. Simulation results and analysis are provided to compare different approaches, including greedy and brute force solution.}

In nonlinear case, the nonuniform improvement of estimates’ accuracy is demonstrated that enables to overperform the quality of linear estimates. An ensemble of numerical results, obtained by four OpenFOAM solvers for the inviscid compressible flow with an oblique shock wave, is used as the input data. A comparison of approximation errors, obtained by these methods, and the exact error, computed as the difference of numerical solutions and the analytical solution, is presented.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the specific kind of uncertainties, which appear in ontology-driven software development. We focus on the development of IoT applications whose source code is generated automatically by an ontology-driven framework. So-called “compatibility uncertainties” pop up when the ontology is being changed while the corresponding generated application is in operation. This specific kind of uncertainties can be treated as a variant of implementation uncertainties. The algorithm of its automated handling is presented. The proposed algorithm is implemented within the SciVi platform and tested in the real-world project devoted to the development of custom IoT-based hardware user interfaces for virtual reality. We use the SciVi platform as a toolset for the automatic generation of IoT devices firmware for ontology-driven Edge Computing but the problem discussed is common for any tools which are used for the generation of ontology-driven software.\n}

	abstract = {\nData from Social Networks is a valuable asset within both a scientific and a business world. In the context of this work, ontological modelling from Social Networks is understood as a knowledge building process to generate a shared domain model. Such a technique relies on a balanced co-existence of human intuition/creativity and technological support, referred to as Hybrid Intelligence. Additionally, it assumes collaborative modelling and collective/social intelligence. The method implies a certain degree of uncertainty that is, in principle, inversely proportional to the achieved consensus. There are two clear different convergence points between the proposed process and collective/social intelligence: (i) at a data level, because of the nature of the input which is generated by different individuals, communities, stakeholders and actors; and (ii) at a modelling level, where human and automatically generated inputs, design decisions and validations are expected to involve several contributors, experts, modellers or analysts. Although looking holistically at the modelling process, this paper concisely focuses mostly on the ontological structure and the associated uncertainty, while resulting systems and studies are object of future work.}

	abstract = {This research is introducing and evaluating the new method supporting grow of programming skills, computational thinking and development of problem-solving approach that evolutionarily introduce programming good practices and paradigms through a block-based programming. The proposed approach utilizes problem-based Scottie-Go game followed by Scratch programming environment implanted to Python programming course to improve the learners’ programming skills and keeps motivation for further discovery of computational problem-solving activity. To date, practically little work has been devoted to examining the relationship between beginner development environments and the development practices they stimulate in their users. This article tries to shed light on this aspect of learning programming by carefully examining the behaviour of novice programmers using the innovative block-based programming learning method.}

In this paper we present some simple “pathological” and “non-pathological” examples for comparison with symbolic calculations which lie behind calculations in FP with double precision. The CAS programs: Mathematica and wxMaxima are used for calculation. We explain, by making calculations directly from the definition of double precision, why in the presented examples such final results were obtained. We present a didactic experiment for students of the Informatics Faculty of Warsaw University of Life Sciences within the course of Numerical Methods.}

	abstract = {Modern programming languages are very complex, diverse, and non-uniform in their structure, code composition, and syntax. Therefore, it is a difficult task for computer science students to retrieve relevant code snippets from large code repositories, according to their programming course requirements. To solve this problem, an AI-based approach is proposed, for students to better understand and learn code semantics, with solutions for real-world coding exercises. First, a large number of solutions are collected from a course titled “Algorithms and Data Structures” and preprocessed, by removing unnecessary elements. Second, the solution code is converted into a sequence of words and tokenized. Third, the sequence of tokens is used to train and validate the model, through a word embedding layer. Finally, the model is used for the relevant code retrieval and classification task, for the students. In this study, a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) is used as the core deep neural network model. For the experiment, approximately 120,000 real-world solutions from three datasets are used. The trained model achieved an average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 94.35%, 94.71%, 94.45%, and 95.97% for the code classification task, respectively. These results show that the proposed approach has potential for use in programming education.\n}

	abstract = {The memory palace, also known as the memory journey, is a mnemonic technique where information to be remembered is encountered along a predetermined path through envisioned places, creating strong spatial and visual connections between the material and specific locations and vivid images. Constructing a memory palace for complex computer science concepts may prove challenging for students, as it requires the identification, selection, and organization of essential ideas from the material. This task is better suited to an expert on the curriculum, such as the instructor. In this paper, a framework for designing and delivering Guided Mnemonic Journeys is proposed. Led by a teacher in person or via audio or video, the approach uses a virtual tour of the university campus at its core. The approach combines various mnemonic techniques to create a more comprehensive approach to memory enhancement. The instructor plans the story arc and places various mnemonic cues along the path and then guides the students through the narrative and imagery, providing context, clear structure, and instructions for each step. A pilot study indicated that students perceived the delivered Guided Mnemonic Journeys positively, appreciating the rich didactic activity and the opportunity to learn new mnemonic techniques.}

The experience presented in the article was gathered during last four years (2019-2022). The COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the way the classes were conducted in 2020 and 2021, gave us an opportunity to compare the same means of gamification used in the same course in different learning environments. The evaluation results show that gamification yielded better results when applied in an in-person environment.}

	abstract = {Agile development (AD) is a methodology that many small businesses have adopted for production convenience, and educators have taken notice of the trend. A need to implement some form of agile development in undergraduate programs at universities is now clear, particularly for undergraduate engineering students who should understand their role in a project focused on AD. This paper presents our preliminary evaluation of user experience (UX) using an Earned Value Management (EVM) simulator, which helps the student understand the team member’s role in an agile development process. The simulator uses a Task-board interface to display task status changes, a burn-down chart to depict the remaining work, and EVM metrics to assess the efficiency of the teamwork. Using the Task-board and EVM models, the simulator offers students different agile project management experimental experiences.}
