	abstract = {In this paper, the issue of tailoring the soft confusion matrix (SCM) based classifier to deal with stream learning task is addressed. The main goal of the work is to develop a wrapping-classifier that allows incremental learning to classifiers that are unable to learn incrementally. The goal is achieved by making two improvements in the previously developed SCM classifier. The first one is aimed at reducing the computational cost of the SCM classifier. To do so, the definition of the fuzzy neighbourhood of an object is changed. The second one is aimed at effective dealing with the concept drift. This is done by employing the ADWIN-driven concept drift detector that is not only used to detect the drift but also to control the size of the neighbourhood. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the reference methods.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of functional, random data classification from equidistant samples. Such data are frequently not easy for classification when one has a large number of observations that bear low information for classification. We consider this problem using tools from the functional analysis. Therefore, a mathematical model of such data is proposed and its correctness is verified. Then, it is shown that any finite number of descriptors, obtained by orthogonal projections on any differentiable basis of \\(L_2(0,\\, T)\\), can be consistently estimated within this model. Computational aspects of estimating descriptors, based on the fast implementation of the discrete cosine transform (DCT), are also investigated in conjunction with learning a classifier and using it on-line. Finally, the algorithm of learning descriptors and classifiers were tested on real-life random signals, namely, on accelerations, coming from large bucket-wheel excavators, that are transmitted to an operator’s cabin. The aim of these tests was also to select a classifier that is well suited for working with DCT-based descriptors.}

Various machine learning methods and their combinations are considered to improve the quality of the classification of imbalanced datasets. This paper presents the approach with the clustering and weighted scoring function based on geometric space are used. In particular, we proposed a significant modification to our earlier algorithm. The proposed change concerns the use of automatic estimating the number of clusters and determining the minimum number of objects in a particular cluster. The proposed algorithm was compared with our earlier proposal and state-of-the-art algorithms using highly imbalanced datasets. The performed experiments show that the proposed modification is statistically better for a larger number of reference classifiers than the original algorithm.}

	abstract = {One of the long-standing difficulties in machine learning involves distortions present in data – different input feature vectors may represent the same entity. This observation has led to the introduction of invariant machine learning methods, for example techniques that ignore shifts, rotations, or light and pose changes in images. These approaches typically utilize pre-defined invariant features or invariant kernels, and require the designer to analyze what type of distortions are to be expected. While specifying possible sources of variance is straightforward for images, it is more difficult in other domains. Here, we focus on learning an invariant representation from data, without any information of what the distortions present in the data, only based on information whether any two samples are distorted variants of the same entity, or not. In principle, standard neural network architectures should be able to learn the invariance from data, given sufficient numbers of examples of it. We report that, somewhat surprisingly, learning to approximate even a simple types of invariant representation is difficult. We then propose a new type of layer, with a richer output representation, one that is better suited for learning invariances from data.}

	abstract = {Many different decision problems require taking a compromise between the various goals we want to achieve into account. A specific group of features often decides the state of a given object. An example of such a task is the feature selection that allows increasing the decision’s quality while minimizing the cost of features or the total budget. The work’s main purpose is to compare feature selection methods such as the classical approach, the one-objective optimization, and the multi-objective optimization. The article proposes a feature selection algorithm using the Genetic Algorithm with various criteria, i.e., the cost and accuracy. In this way, the optimal Pareto points for the nonlinear problem of multi-criteria optimization were obtained. These points constitute a compromise between two conflicting objectives. By carrying out various experiments on various base classifiers, it has been shown that the proposed approach can be used in the task of optimizing difficult data.}

	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for embedding features for action recognition on raw depth maps. Our approach demonstrates high potential when amount of training data is small. A convolutional autoencoder is trained to learn embedded features, encapsulating the content of single depth maps. Afterwards, multichannel 1D CNN features are extracted on multivariate time-series of such embedded features to represent actions on depth map sequences. In the second stream the dynamic time warping is used to extract action features on multivariate streams of statistical features from single depth maps. The output of the third stream are class-specific action features extracted by TimeDistributed and LSTM layers. The action recognition is achieved by voting in an ensemble of one-vs-all weak classifiers. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive results on UTD-MHAD dataset and outperforms by a large margin the best algorithms on 3D Human-Object Interaction Set (SYSU 3DHOI).}

The experiments were performed on a numerical dataset in which three groups are present:\xa0healthy controls, glaucoma suspects, and glaucoma patients. Overall, it consists of medical records from 211 cases described by 48 features, being the values of biomarkers, collected at the time of glaucoma diagnosis. To avoid the risk of losing information hidden in the features, the proposed method – for each base classifier – draws a separate subset of the features from the available pool, according to the probability determined by the anova test. The method was validated with four base classifiers and various subspace sizes, and compared with existing feature selection methods. For all of the presented base classifiers, the method achieved superior results in comparison with the others. A high generalization power is maintained for different subspace sizes which also reduces the need to optimize method hyperparameters. Experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method to create an ensemble of classifiers for small, high-dimensional datasets.}

	abstract = {Missing value imputation is a problem often meet when working with medical and biometric data sets. Prior to working on these datasets, missing values have to be eliminated. It could be done by imputing estimated values. However, imputation should not bias data, nor alter the class balance. This paper presents an innovative approach to the problem of imputation of missing values in the training data for the classification. Method uses the k-NN classifier on a separate features to impute missing values. The unique approach used in this method allows using data from incomplete vectors to impute another incomplete vectors, unlike in conventional methods, where only complete vectors could be used in the imputation process. The paper also describes a test protocol, where the Cross Validation with a Set Substitution method is used as an evaluation tool for scoring missing value imputation methods.}

	abstract = {\nOpen-set classifiers need to be able to recognize inputs that are unlike the training or known data. As this problem, known as out-of-distribution (OoD) detection, is non-trivial, a number of methods to do this have been proposed. These methods are mostly heuristic, with no clear consensus in the literature as to which should be used in specific OoD detection tasks. In this work, we focus on a recently proposed, yet popular, Extreme Value Machine (EVM) algorithm. The method is unique as it uses parametric models of class inclusion, justified by the Extreme Value Theory, and as such is deemed superior to heuristic methods. However, we demonstrated a number of open-set text and image recognition tasks, in which the EVM was outperformed by simple heuristics. We explain this by showing that the parametric (Weibull) model in EVM is not appropriate in many real datasets, which is due to unsatisfied assumptions of the Extreme Value Theorem. Hence we argue that the EVM should be considered another heuristic method.}

	abstract = {Ensemble methods in combination with data preprocessing techniques are one of the most used approaches to dealing with the problem of imbalanced data classification. At the same time, the literature indicates the potential capability of classifier selection/ensemble pruning methods to deal with imbalance without the use of preprocessing, due to the ability to use expert knowledge of the base models in specific regions of the feature space. The aim of this work is to check whether the use of ensemble pruning algorithms may allow for increasing the ensemble’s ability to detect minority class instances at the level comparable to the methods employing oversampling techniques. Two approaches based on the clustering of base models in the diversity space, proposed by the author in previous articles, were evaluated based on the computer experiments conducted on \n\n\n\n benchmark datasets with a high Imbalance Ratio. The obtained results and the performed statistical analysis confirm the potential of employing classifier selection methods for the classification of data with the skewed class distribution.}

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on class imbalance issue which often leads to sub-optimal performance of classifiers. Despite many attempts to solve this problem, there is still a need to look for better ones, which can overcome the limitations of known methods. For this reason we developed a new algorithm that in contrast to traditional random undersampling removes maximum k nearest neighbors of the samples which belong to the majority class. In such a way, there has been achieved not only the effect of reduction in size of the majority set but also the excessive removal of too many points from the given area has been successfully prevented. The conducted experiments are provided for eighteen imbalanced datasets, and confirm the usefulness of the proposed method to improve the results of the classification task, as compared to other undersampling methods. Non-parametric statistical tests show that these differences are usually statistically significant.}

	abstract = {\nNowadays, the task of forecasting the client’s behavior using his/her digital footprints is highly demanded. There are many approaches to predict the client’s next purchase or the next location visited that focus on achieving the best possible prediction quality in terms of different quality metrics. Within such approaches, the quality is however usually evaluated on the entire set of clients, without dividing them into classes with a different predictability rate of client’s behavior. In contrast to the approaches of this type, we propose a method for the identification of the client’s behaviour predictability class by means of a foreign trip in the next month by using only client’s historical transactional data. In a sense, this allows us to estimate the quality of forecasting the client’s foreign trip before the actual prediction procedure. Our experiments show that the approach is rather efficient and that the predictability classes obtained quite agree with the prediction quality classes found within the actual forecasting.}

	abstract = {As smartphones strive to provide more versatility and functionality to satiate their growing demand, more user data becomes vulnerable and exposed to attackers. Successful mobile malware attacks could steal a user’s location, photos, or even banking information. Due to the lack of post-attack strategies, firms also risk going out of business due to data theft. Thus, there is a need to not only detect malware intrusion in smartphones but to also identify the data that has been stolen in order to assess, aid in recovery and prevent future attacks. In this paper, we propose such a machine learning solution (https://github.com/PrasannaKumaran/AndroidDataTheft) which is accessible, non-intrusive and can perform intrusion detection and stolen data classification for any app under supervision. We do this with Android usage data obtained from publicly available data collection framework–SherLock. We test the performance of our architecture for multiple users on real-world data collected using the same framework. Our architecture exhibits less than 9% inaccuracy in detecting malware and can classify the type of data that is being stolen with 83% certainty.\n}

	abstract = {One of the outstanding benchmark architectures for point cloud processing with graph-based structures is Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN). Though it works well for classification of nearly perfectly described digital models, it leaves much to be desired for real-life cases burdened with noise and 3D scanning shadows. Therefore we propose a novel, feature-preserving vicinity abstraction (VA) layer for the EdgeConv module. This allowed for enriching the global feature vector with the local context provided by the k-NN graph. Rather than processing a point together with its neighbours at once, local information is aggregated before further processing, unlike in the original DGCNN. Such an approach enabled a model to learn accumulated information instead of max-pooling features from local context at the end of each EdgeConv module. Thanks to this strategy mean- and overall classification accuracy increased by 9.4pp and 4.4pp, respectively. Furthermore, thanks to processing aggregated information rather than the entire vicinity, the new VA-DGCNN model converges significantly faster than the original DGCNN.}

However, not all publicly known vulnerabilities have criticality rating in CVSS 3.x, which is the latest and most advanced version of the standard. This is due to the large time gap between the publication of the CVSS 2.0 and CVSS 3.x standards, the large number of the detected and published vulnerabilities at the time, and significant differences in the method of determining vulnerability criticality and assigning vector properties to evaluation components. Consequently, organizations using CVSS to prioritize vulnerabilities use both CVSS versions and abandoned the full transition to CVSS 3.x standard. In this paper authors introduce machine learning algorithms for performing conversions from CVSS 2.0 to CVSS 3.x, scores, which should significantly facilitate the upgrade to CVSS 3.x standard for all stakeholders.

	abstract = {Low voltage electricity distribution network actively maintains the stability of its key parameters, primarily against the predictable regularity of seasonal changes. This makes long-term coarse prediction practical, but it hampers the accuracy of a short-term fine-grained one. Such predictability can further improve the stability of the network. This paper presents the outcome of research to determine whether Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can improve the accuracy of the prediction of next-second values of three network parameters: voltage, frequency and harmonic distortions. Four ML models were tested: XGBoost Regressor, Dense neural networks (both one and two layer) and LSTM networks, against static predictors. Real data collected from the actual network were used for both training and testing. The challenging nature of this data is due to the network executing corrective measures, thus making parameter values return to their means. This results in non-normal distribution with strong long-term memory impact, but with no viable correlation to use for short-term prediction. Still, results indicate improvements of up\xa0to 20%, even for non-optimized ML algorithms, with some scope for further improvements.}

	abstract = {Defining accurate and flexible models for real-world networks of human beings is instrumental to understand the observed properties of phenomena taking place across those networks and to support computer simulations of dynamic processes of interest for several areas of research – including computational epidemiology, which is recently high on the agenda. In this paper we present a flexible model to generate age-stratified and geo-referenced synthetic social networks on the basis of widely available aggregated demographic data and, possibly, of estimated age-based social mixing patterns. Using the Italian city of Florence as a case study, we characterize our network model under selected configurations and we show its potential as a building block for the simulation of infections’ propagation. A fully operational and parametric implementation of our model is released as open-source.}

	abstract = {The emergence of word embeddings has created good conditions for natural language processing used in an increasing number of applications related to machine translation and language understanding. Several word-embedding models have been developed and applied, achieving considerably good performance. In addition, several enriching word embedding methods have been provided by handling various information such as polysemous, subwords, temporal, and spatial. However, prior popular vector representations of words ignored the knowledge of synonyms. This is a drawback, particularly for languages with large vocabularies and numerous synonym words. In this study, we introduce an approach to enrich the vector representation of words by considering the synonym information based on the vectors’ extraction and presentation from their context words. Our proposal includes three main steps: First, the context words of the synonym candidates are extracted using a context window to scan the entire corpus; second, these context words are grouped into small clusters using the latent Dirichlet allocation method; and finally, synonyms are extracted and converted into vectors from the synonym candidates based on their context words. In comparison to recent word representation methods, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves considerably good performance in terms of word similarity.}

Goal: This study aimed to show that searching the full text of articles is important for SLRs, and to provide a way to perform such searches in an automated and unified way. Method: The authors created a tool that allows users to download the full text of articles and perform a full-text search. Results: The tool, named ASH, provides a meta-search interface that allows users to obtain much higher search completeness, unifies the search process across all digital libraries, and can overcome the limitations of individual search engines. We use a practical example to identify the potential value of the tool and the limitations of some of the existing digital library search facilities. Conclusions: Our example confirms both that it is important to create such tools and how they can potentially improve the SLR search process. Although the tool does not support all stages of SLR, our example confirms its value for supporting the SLR search process.}

	abstract = {Learning from imbalanced data streams is one of the challenges for classification algorithms and learning classifiers. The goal of the paper is to propose and validate a new approach for learning from data streams. However, the paper references a problem of class-imbalanced data. In this paper, a hybrid approach for changing the class distribution towards a more balanced data using the over-sampling and instance selection techniques is discussed. The proposed approach assumes that classifiers are induced from incoming blocks of instances, called data chunks. These data chunks consist of incoming instances from different classes and a balance between them is obtained through the hybrid approach. These data chunks are next used to induce classifier ensembles. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using several selected benchmark datasets and the computational experiment results are presented and discussed. The results of the computational experiment show that the proposed approach for eliminating class imbalance in data streams can help increase the performance of online learning algorithms.}

Appropriate data quality ensures the validity of decisions made by any decision-maker. A very promising area to overcome common data quality issues is computational intelligence. This paper examines from past to current intelligence techniques used for assessing data quality, reflecting the trend for the last two decades. Results of a bibliometric analysis are derived and summarized based on the embedded clustered themes in the data quality field. In addition, a network visualization map and strategic diagrams based on keyword co-occurrence are presented. These reports demonstrate that computational intelligence, such as machine and deep learning, fuzzy set theory, evolutionary computing is essential for uncovering and solving data quality issues.}

To evaluate the MPF performance we solve instances of two well-known NP-hard problems – job shop scheduling and flow shop scheduling. In MPF a collective of simple agents works in parallel communicating indirectly through the access to the common memory. Each agent receives a solution from this memory and writes it back after a successful improvement. Computational experiment results confirm that the proposed MPF framework can offer competitive results as compared with other recently published approaches.}

	abstract = {The article is dedicated to the issue of classification based on independent data sources. A\xa0new approach proposed in the paper is a classification method for independent local decision tables that is based on the bagging method. For each local decision table, sub-tables are generated with the bagging method, based on which the decision trees are built. Such decision trees classify the test object, and a probability vector is defined over the decision classes for each local table. For each vector decision classes with the maximum value of the coordinates are selected and the final joint decision for all local tables is made by majority voting. The results were compared with the baseline method of generating one decision tree based on one local table. It cannot be clearly stated that more bootstrap replicates guarantee better classification quality. However, it was shown that the bagging classification trees produces more unambiguous results which are in many cases better than for the baseline method.}

It consists of three main elements: social agents with a specified knowledge structure, a list of communication modes describing how agents send outbound messages, and a list of integration strategies describing how agents react to incoming messages. The model is described in detail, with examples given for important subalgorithms. The model is then analyzed in comparison to epidemic SI models in knowledge diffusion tasks and tested in a simulated environment. The tests show that it behaves according to the expectations for real world groups.}

The core of the proposed approach is a generic spatial Susceptible-Infected-Recovered stochastic discrete system. Our model aims at evaluating the effect of prophylactic and mobility limitation measures on the impact and magnitude of the epidemics spread. The paper introduces the modeling approach and, next, it proceeds to the development of a multi-agent simulation system. The proposed system is implemented and evaluated using the GAMA multi-agent platform, using several simulation scenarios, while the experimental results are discussed in detail. Our model is abstract and well defined, making it very suitable as a starting point for extension and application to more detailed models of the specific problems.}

Majority of the existing studies focus on maximizing global coverage in the social network through initial seeds selection. In reality, networks are heterogeneous and different nodes can be a goal depending on campaign objectives. In this paper a novel approach with multi-attribute targeted influence maximization is proposed. The approach uses the multi-attribute nature of the network nodes (age, gender etc.) to better target specified groups of users. The proposed approach is verified on a real network and compared to the classic approaches delivers 7.14% coverage increase.}

	abstract = {This study presents a new hybrid approach to predictive modelling of disease dynamics for finding optimal therapy. We use existing methods, such as expert-based modelling methods, models of system dynamics and ML methods in compositions together with our proposed modelling methods for simulating treatment process and predicting treatment outcomes depending on the different therapy types. Treatment outcomes include a set of treatment-goal values, therapy types include a combination of drugs and treatment procedures. Personal therapy recommendation by this approach is optimal in terms of achieving the best treatment multipurpose outcomes. We use this approach in the task of creating a practical tool for finding optimal therapy for T2DM disease. The proposed tool was validated using surveys of experts, clinical recommendations [1], and classic metrics for predictive task. All these validations have shown that the proposed tool is high-quality, interpretable and usability, therefore it can be used as part of the Decision Support System for medical specialists who work with T2DM patients.}

	abstract = {In General Practitioner’s work the fundamental problem is the accuracy of the diagnosis under time constraints and health care cost limitations. The General Practitioner (GP) after an interview and a physical examination makes a preliminary diagnosis. The goal of the paper is to find the set of tests with such total diagnostic potential in verification of this diagnosis that is not smaller than a threshold value and with minimal total cost of tests. In proposed solution method, the set of preliminary diagnoses after the interview and the physical examination is given. For each preliminary diagnosis, for each test, diagnostic potential of the test in verification of the diagnosis is determined using Analytic Hierarchy Process based method with medical expert participation. Then binary linear programming problem with constraint imposed on total diagnostic potential of tests but with criterion function of minimal total test cost is solved for each diagnosis. For the case study when the patient with lumbal pain is coming to the GP, for each of six preliminary diagnoses, for each test, the diagnostic potentials of tests have been estimated. Then for each diagnosis, the solution of the binary linear programming problem has been found. A limitation of the case study is the estimation of diagnostic potential of tests by one expert only.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive network model for the development of and recovery from burnout was designed and analysed. The current literature lacks adequate adaptive models to describe the processes involved in burnout. In this research, the informal conceptual models from Golembiewski and Leiter-Maslach were combined with additional first- and second-order adaptive components and used to design a computational network model based on them. Four different scenarios were simulated and compared, where the importance of the therapy and the ability to learn from it was emphasised. The results show that if there was no therapy present, the emotion regulation was too poor to have effect. However, at the moment therapy was applied, the emotion regulation would start to help against a burnout. Another finding was that one long therapy session has more effect than several shorter sessions. Lastly, therapy only had a significant long-lasting effect when adaquate neuro-plasticity occurred.}

	abstract = {Emotions play an important role in everyday life and contribute to physical and emotional well-being. They can be identified by verbal or non-verbal signs. Emotional states can be also detected by electroencephalography (EEG signals). However, efficient information retrieval from the EEG sensors is a difficult and complex task due to noise from the internal and external artifacts and overlapping signals from different electrodes. Therefore, the appropriate electrode selection and discovering the brain parts and electrode locations that are most or least correlated with different emotional states is of great importance. We propose using reversed correlation-based algorithm for intra-user electrode selection, and the inter-subject subset analysis to establish electrodes least correlated with emotions for all users. Moreover, we identified subsets of electrodes most correlated with emotional states. The proposed method has been verified by experiments done on the DEAP dataset. The obtained results have been evaluated regarding the recognition of two emotions: valence and arousal. The experiments showed that the appropriate reduction of electrodes has no negative influence on emotion recognition. The differences between errors for recognition based on all electrodes and the selected subsets were not statistically significant. Therefore, where appropriate, reducing the number of electrodes may be beneficial in terms of collecting less data, simplifying the EEG analysis, and improving interaction problems without recognition loss.}

	abstract = {Normally, it takes many years of theoretical and clinical training for a physician to be the movement disorder specialist. It takes additional multiple years of the clinical practice to handle various “non-typical” cases. The purpose of our study was to predict neurodegenerative disease development by abstract rules learned from experienced neurologists. Theory of mind (ToM) is human’s ability to represent mental states such as emotions, intensions or knowledge of others. ToM is crucial not only in human social interactions but also is used by neurologists to find an optimal treatment for patients with neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). On the basis of doctors’ expertise, we have used supervised learning to build AI system that consists of abstract granules representing ToM of several movement disorders neurologists (their knowledge and intuitions). We were looking for similarities between granules of patients in different disease stages to granules of more advanced PD patients. We have compared group of 23 PD with attributes measured three times every half of the year (G1V1, G1V2, G1V3) to other group of 24 more advanced PD (G2V1). By means of the supervised learning and rough set theory we have found rules describing symptoms of G2V1 and applied them to G1V1, G1V2, and G1V3. We have obtained the following accuracies for all/speed/emotion/cognition attributes: G1V1: 68/59/53/72%; G1V2: 72/70/79/79%; G1V3: 82/92/71/74%. These results support our hypothesis that divergent sets of granules were characteristic for different brain’s parts that might degenerate in non-uniform ways with Parkinson’s disease progression.}

	abstract = {Apart from various other neural and hormonal changes caused by stress, frequent and long-term activation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress leads in an adaptive manner to the inadequacy of the stress response system. This leads to a cognitive dysfunction where the subject is no more able to downregulate his or her stress due to the atrophy in the hippocampus and hypertrophy in the amygdala. These atrophies can be dealt with by antidepressant treatment or psychological treatments like cognitive and behavioural therapies. In this paper, an adaptive neuroscience-based computational network model is introduced which demonstrates such a cognitive dysfunction due to a long-term stressor and regaining of the cognitive abilities through a cognitive-behavioural therapy: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Simulation results are reported for the model which demonstrates the adaptivity as well as the dynamic interaction of the involved brain areas in the phenomenon.}

	abstract = {Among the most disabling disorders, mental illness is one that affects millions of people across the world. Although a great deal of research has been done to prevent mental disorders, detecting mental illness in potential patients remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel metaphor-based approach (MAM) to determine whether a social media user has a mental disorder or not by classifying social media texts. We observe that the social media texts posted by people with mental illness often contain many implicit emotions that metaphors can express. Therefore, we extract these texts’ metaphor features as the primary indicator for the text classification task. Our approach firstly proposes a CNN-RNN (Convolution Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) framework to enable the representations of long texts. The metaphor features are then applied to the attention mechanism for achieving the metaphorical emotions-based mental illness detection. Subsequently, compared with other works, our approach achieves creative results in the detection of mental illnesses. The recall scores of MAM on depression, anorexia, and suicide detection are the highest, with 0.50, 0.70, and 0.65, respectively. Furthermore, MAM has the best F1 scores on depression and anorexia detection tasks, with 0.51 and 0.71.}

	abstract = {Process mining is an emerging study area adopting a data-driven approach and classical model-based process analysis. Process mining techniques are applicable in different domains and may represent standalone tools or integrated solutions within other fields. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a meta-states concept to extract additional features from discovered process models for predictive modelling. We show how a simple assumption about cyclic process behaviours can not only help to structure and interpret the process model but to be used in machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the proposed approach for hypertension control status prognosis within a remote monitoring program. The results are potential for medical diagnosis and model interpretation.}

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks have already found widespread use for the formation of artificial, but realistic images of a wide variety of content, including medical imaging. Mostly they are considered to be used for expanding and augmenting datasets in order to improve accuracy of neural networks classification. In this paper we discuss the problem of evaluating the quality of computer tomography images of lung cancer, which is characterized by small size of nodules, synthesized using two different generative adversarial network, architectures – for 2D and 3D dimensions. We select the set of metrics for estimating the quality of the generated images, including Visual Turing Test, FID and MRR metrics; then we carry out a problem-oriented modification of the Turing test in order to adapt it both to the actually obtained images and to resource constraints. We compare the constructed GANs using the selected metrics; and we show that such a parameter as the size of the generated image is very important in the development of the GAN architecture. We consider that with this work we have for the first time shown that for small neo-plasms, direct scaling of the corresponding solutions used to generate large neo-plasms (for example, gliomas) is ineffective. Developed assessment methods have shown that additional techniques like MIP and special combinations of metrics are required to generate small neoplasms. In addition, an important conclusion can be considered that it is very important to use GAN networks not only, as is usually the case, for augmentation and expansion of the datasets, but for direct use in clinical practice by radiologists.}

	abstract = {This paper evaluates three convolutional neural network architectures – U-Net, SegNet, and Fully Convolutional (FC) DenseNets – in application to kidney segmentation in the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI). We found U-Net to outperform the alternative solutions with the Jaccard coefficient equal to 94% against 93% and 91% for SegNet and FCDenseNets, respectively. As a next step, we propose to classify renal mask voxels into cortex, medulla, and pelvis based on temporal characteristics of signal intensity time courses. We evaluate our computational framework on a set of 20 DCE-MRI series by calculating image-derived glomerular filtration rates (GFR) – an indicator of renal tissue state. Then we compare our calculated GFR with the available ground-truth values measured in the iohexol clearance tests. The mean bias between the two measurements amounts to −7.4 ml/min/1.73\xa0m2 which proves the reliability of the designed segmentation pipeline.}

	abstract = {Feature selection is an important step of machine learning pipeline. Certain models may select features intrinsically without human interactions or additional algorithms applied. Such algorithms usually belong to neural networks class. Others require help of a researcher or feature selection algorithms. However, it is hard to know beforehand which variables contain the most relevant information and which may cause difficulties for a model to learn the correct relations. In that respect, researchers have been developing feature selection algorithms. To understand what methods perform better on tabular medical data, we have conducted a set of experiments to measure accuracy, stability and compare interpretation capacities of different feature selection approaches. Moreover, we propose an application of Bayesian Inference to the task of feature selection that may provide more interpretable and robust solution. We believe that high stability and interpretability are as important as classification accuracy especially in predictive tasks in medicine.}

	abstract = {The paper addresses the problem of extending an existing and widely used program for Polish public healthcare with a function for detecting possible occurrences of drug side effects. The task is performed in two steps. First, we extract information that binds names of drugs with side effects and their frequency. In the next step, we look for similar phrases in the list of side effect phrases. For all words in phrases, we use Polish Wordnet to find similar ones, and check if phrases with replaced words exist in the list. For long side effect phrases, which never occur in patient records, we look for simpler internal side effect phrases to generate alarms. Finally, we evaluate to what extent this action increases the efficiency of side effect alarms.}

	abstract = {To popularise in silico trials for development of new medical devices, drugs, or treatment procedures, we present the modelling framework des-ist (Discrete Event Simulation framework for In Silico Trials). This framework supports discrete event-based simulations. Here, events are collected in an acyclic, directed graph, where each node corresponds to a component of the overall in silico trial. A simple API and data layout are proposed to easily couple numerous simulations by means of containerised environments, i.e. Docker and Singularity. An example in silico trial is highlighted studying treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as considered in the INSIST project. The proposed framework enables straightforward coupling of the discrete models, reproducible outcomes by containerisation, and easy parallel execution by GNU Parallel. Furthermore, des-ist supports the user in creating, running, and analysing large numbers of virtual cohorts, automating repetitive user interactions. In future work, we aim to provide a tight integration with validation, verication and uncertainty quantication analyses, to enable sensitivity analysis of individual components of in silico trials and improve trust in the computational outcome to successfully augment classical medical trials and thereby enable faster development of treatment procedures.}

	abstract = {There is a range of public health tools and interventions to address the global pandemic of COVID-19. Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly represented interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects.}

	abstract = {In this research, we aimed to assess the influence of herd immunity levels on the process of co-circulation of influenza strains in urban populations and to establish how the stochastic nature of epidemic processes might affect this influence. A spatially explicit individual-based model of multistrain epidemic dynamics was developed and simulations were performed using a 2010 synthetic population of Saint Petersburg, Russia. According to the simulation results, the largest influenza outbreaks are associated with low immunity levels to the virus strains which caused by these strains. At the same time, high immunity levels per se do not prevent outbreaks, although they might affect the resulting levels of disease prevalence. The results of the study will be used in the research of long-term immunity formation dynamics to influenza strains in Russian cities.}

We present a method for such two-way coupling of a one-dimensional arterial blood flow model and a three-dimensional tissue perfusion model. The two-way coupling occurs through the pial surface, where the pressure drop between the models is captured using a coupling resistance. The two-way coupled model is used to simulate arterial blood flow and tissue perfusion during an acute ischaemic stroke. Infarct volume is estimated by setting a threshold on the perfusion change. By two-way coupling these two models, the effect of retrograde flow and its effect on tissue perfusion and infarct volume can be captured.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a comparison of effectiveness of the artificial intelligence techniques in diagnosis of arteriovenous fistula condition. The use of discrete cosine transform (DTC) combined cepstrum in the feature extraction process made it possible to increase the value of classification quality indicators by about 10% (when compared to the previous approach based on averaged energy values in the third octave bands). This paper presents a methodology of extracting features from the acoustic signal emitted by the fistula. The supervised machine learning technique of k-NN, Multilayer Perceptron, RBF Network and Decision Tree C4.5 classifiers was applied to develop the classification model. For this, signals obtained from 38 patients on chronic hemodialysis were used. The results show that the cepstral analysis and obtained features provide an accuracy of above 90% in proper detection of vascular access stenosis.}

	abstract = {ECG recordings from wearable devices are affected with a relatively high amount of noise due to body motion and long time of the examination, which leads to many false alarms on ill-state detection and forces medical staff to spend more time on describing each recording. ECG quality assessment is hard due to impulse character of the signal and its high variability. In this paper we describe an anomaly detection algorithm based on the Autoencoder trained on good quality examples only. Once trained, this neural network reconstructs clean ECG signals more accurately than noisy examples, which allows to distinguish both classes. Presented method achieves a normalized F1 score of 93.34% on the test set extracted from public dataset of 2011\xa0PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge, outperforming the solution based on the best competition participants. In contrary to many state-of-the-art methods it can be applied even on short, single-channel ECG signals.}

	abstract = {Coronary artery stenosis is a condition that restricts blood flow to the myocardium, potentially leading to ischemia and acute coronary events. To decide whether an intervention is needed, different criteria can be used, e.g. calculation of fractional flow reserve (FFR). FFR can also be computed based on computer simulations of blood flow (virtual FFR, vFFR). Here we propose an alternative, more direct, metric for assessing the hemodynamic value of stenosis from computational models, the computed volumetric flow drop (VFD). VFD and vFFR are computed for several stenosis locations using a 1D model of the left coronary tree, and also an analytical model is presented to show why FFR value may differ from the true flow reduction. The results show that FFR\u2009=\u20090.8, which is often used as a criterion for stenting, may correspond to a reduction in volumetric flow from less than 10% to almost 30% depending on the stenosis location. The implications are that FFR-based assessment may overestimate the hemodynamic value of stenosis, and it’s preferable to use a more direct metric for simulation-based estimation of stenosis value.}

	abstract = {Triage in emergency department (ED) is adopted procedure in several countries using different emergency severity index systems. The objective is to subdivide patients into categories of increasing acuity to allow for prioritization and reduce emergency department congestion. However, while several studies have focused on improving the triage system and managing medical resources, the classification of patients depends strongly on nurse’s subjective judgment and thus is prone to human errors. So, it is crucial to set up a system able to model, classify and reason about vague, incomplete and uncertain knowledge. Thus, we propose in this paper a novel fuzzy ontology based on a new Fuzzy Emergency Severity Index (F-ESI_2.0) to improve the accuracy of current triage systems. Therefore, we model some fuzzy relevant medical subdomains that influence the patient’s condition. Our approach is based on continuous structured and unstructured textual data over more than two years collected during patient visits to the ED of the Lille University Hospital Center (LUHC) in France. The resulting fuzzy ontology is able to model uncertain knowledge and organize the patient’s passage to the ED by treating the most serious patients first. Evaluation results shows that the resulting fuzzy ontology is a complete domain ontology which can improve current triage system failures.}

	abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS) play an increasingly important role in medical practice. By assisting physicians in making clinical decisions and subsequent recommendations, medical DSS are expected to improve the quality of healthcare. The role of DSS in diabetes treatment and in particular in post clinical treatment by organizing an improved regime of food balance and patient diets is the target area of the study. Based on the Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Ontology (DMTO), the developed DSS for dietary recommendations for patients with diabetes mellitus is aimed at improvement of patient care. Having into account the clinical history and the lab test profiles of the patients, these diet recommendations are automatically inferred using the DMTO subontologies for patient’s lifestyle improvement and are based on reasoning on a set of newly developed production rules and the data from the patients records. The research presented in the paper is focused at intelligent integration of all data related to a particular patient and reasoning on them in order to generate personalized diet recommendations. A special-purpose knowledge base has been created, which enriches the DMTO with a set of original production rules and supports the elaboration of broader and more precise personalized dietary recommendations in the scope of the electronic health record services.}
