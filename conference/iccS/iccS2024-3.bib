	abstract = {The process of developing antenna structures typically involves prototype measurements. While accurate validation of far-field performance can be performed in dedicated facilities like anechoic chambers, high cost of construction and maintenance might not justify their use for teaching, or low-budget research scenarios. Non-anechoic experiments provide a cost-effective alternative, however the performance metrics obtained in such conditions require appropriate correction. In this paper, we consider a multitaper approach for post-processing antenna far-field characteristics measured in challenging, non-anechoic environments. The discussed algorithm enhances one-shot measurements to enable extraction of line-of-sight responses while attenuating interferences from multi-path propagation and the noise from external sources of electromagnetic radiation. The performance of the considered method has been demonstrated in uncontrolled conditions using a compact spline-based monopole. Furthermore, the approach has been favorably validated against the state-of-the-art techniques from the literature.}

	abstract = {Design of antennas for modern applications is a challenging task that combines cognition-driven development of topology intertwined with tuning of its parameters using rigorous numerical optimization. However, the process can be streamlined by neglecting the engineering insight in favor of automatic determination of structure geometry. In this work, a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antenna is considered. The radiator is developed using a bi-stage algorithm that involves min-max classification of randomly-generated topologies followed by local tuning of the promising designs using a trust-region optimization applied to a feature-based representation of the structure frequency response. The automatically generated antenna is characterized by –10\xa0dB reflection for over 600\xa0MHz around the center frequency of 6.5\xa0GHz and a dual-lobe radiation pattern. The obtained performance figures make the radiator of use for in-door positioning applications. The design method has been favorably compared against the frequency-based trust-region optimization.}

	abstract = {Antenna far-field performance is normally evaluated in expensive laboratories that maintain strict control over the propagation environment. Alternatively, the responses can be measured in non-anechoic conditions and then refined to extract the information on the structure field-related behavior. Here, a framework for correction of antenna measurements performed in non-anechoic test site has been proposed. The method involves automatic synchronization (in time-domain) of spatially separated measurements followed by their combination so as to augment the fraction of the signal that represents the antenna performance while suppressing the interferences. The method has been demonstrated based on six experiments performed in an office room. The performance improvement due to proposed post-processing amounts to 9.4\xa0dB, which is represents up to over 5\xa0dB improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Numerical methods are important tools for design of modern antennas. Trust-region (TR) methods coupled with data-efficient surrogates based on finite differentiation (FD) represent a popular class of antenna design algorithms. However, TR performance is subject to FD setup, which is normally determined a priori based on rules-of-thumb. In this work, the effect of FD perturbations on the performance of TR-based design is evaluated on a case study basis concerning a total of 80 optimizations of a planar antenna structure. The obtained results demonstrate that, for the considered radiator, the performance of the final designs obtained using different FD setups may vary by as much as 18\xa0dB (and by over 4\xa0dB on average). At the same time, the a priori perturbations in a range between 1.5% and 3% (w.r.t. the initial design) seem to be suitable for maintaining (relatively) consistent and high-quality results.}

	abstract = {Design of ultra-wideband antennas for in-door localization applications is a challenging task. It involves development of geometry that maintains appropriate balance between the size and performance. In this work, a topologically-flexible monopole has been generated using a stratified framework which embeds a gradient-based trust-region (TR) optimization algorithm in a meta-loop that gradually increases the structure dimensionality. The optimization has been performed using a composite objective function that maintains acceptable size/performance trade-off. The final design features a reflection below\u2009−10\xa0dB within the UWB spectrum and a small footprint of only 182\xa0mm2. The considered method has been benchmarked against a standard TR-based routine executed directly on a multi-dimensional electromagnetic model of the antenna.}

	abstract = {With the depletion of IPv4 address resources, the prevalence of IPv4 address leasing services by hosting providers has surged. These services allow users to rent IP blocks, offering an affordable and flexible solution compared to traditional IP address allocation. Unfortunately, this convenience has led to an increase in abuse, with illegal users renting IP blocks to host malicious content such as phishing sites and spam services. To mitigate the issue of IP abuse, some research focuses on individual IP identification for point-wise blacklisting. However, this approach leads to a game of whack-a-mole, where blacklisted IPs become transient due to content migration within the IP block. Other studies take a block perspective, recognizing and classifying IP blocks. This enables the discovery of potentially malicious IPs within the block, effectively countering service migration issues. However, existing IP block identification methods face challenges as they rely on specific WHOIS fields, which are sometimes not updated in real-time, leading to inaccuracies. In terms of classification, methods rely on limited statistical features, overlooking vital relationships between IP blocks, making them susceptible to evasion. To address these challenges, we propose BlockFinder, a two-stage framework. The first stage leverages the temporal and spatial stability of services to identify blocks of varying sizes. In the second stage, we introduce an innovative IP block classification model that integrates global node and local subgraph representations to comprehensively learn the graph structure, thereby enhancing evasion difficulty. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.}

We aim to check which clustering and inference parameters influence the inference efficiency. We used four various real datasets in our experimental stage. Overall, we proceeded with almost twenty thousand experiments. The results prove that the clustering algorithm, the amount of input data, the method of cluster representation, and the subject of clustering significantly impact the inference efficiency.}

	abstract = {Energy efficiency research aims to optimize the use of computing resources by minimizing energy consumption and increasing computational efficiency. This article explores the effect of the directive-based parallel programming model on energy efficiency for the multithreaded WZ factorization on multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and multi-core Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Implementations of the multithreaded WZ factorization (both the basic and its variant optimized by strip-mining vectorization) are based on OpenMP and OpenACC. Strip-mining gave clear enhancement in comparison to the basic version. The energy efficiency is much better on GPU than on CPU; and on CPU, the use of OpenMP is more energy-efficient; however, for GPU, OpenACC gives better results.}

	abstract = {The design and implementation of algorithms for increasingly large and complex modern supercomputers requires the definition of data structures and workload distribution mechanisms in a productive and scalable way. In this paper, we propose a PGAS data structure along with a Work-Stealing mechanism for the class of parallel tree-based algorithms that explore unbalanced trees using the depth-first search strategy. The contribution has been implemented and packaged as an open-source module in the Chapel PGAS language. The experimentation of the contribution in a single-node setting using backtracking applied to fine-grained Unbalanced Tree-Search (UTS) benchmark shows that 68% of the linear speed-up can be achieved. In addition, the scalability of the contribution has been evaluated using the Branch-and-Bound algorithm to solve big instances of the Flowshop Scheduling problem on a large cluster. The reported results reveal that 50% of strong scaling efficiency is achieved using 400 computer nodes (51,200 processing cores).\n}

	abstract = {The paper investigates the stability of text-to-text T5 models in keyword generation tasks, highlighting the sensitivity of their results to subtle experimental variations such as the seed used to shuffle fine-tuning data. The authors advocate for incorporating error bars and standard deviations when reporting results to account for this variability, which is common practice in other domains of data science, but not common in keyphrase generation. Through experiments with T5 models, they demonstrate how small changes in experimental conditions can lead to significant variations in model performance, particularly with larger model sizes. Furthermore, they analyze the coherence within a family of models and propose novel approaches to assess the stability of the model. In general, the findings underscore the importance of considering experimental variability when evaluating and comparing text-to-text models for keyword generation tasks.}

	abstract = {Dictionary-based methods are one of the strategies that have grown in the realm of time series classification. Particularly, these methods are effective for time series data that have different lengths. Our contribution involves introducing the integration of a dictionary-based technique with stacked ensemble learning. This study is unique since it combines the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) with stacking gated recurrent units (GRU) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), referred to as SGCNN, which has not been previously investigated in time series classification. Our approach uses the SAX technique to transform unprocessed numerical data into a symbolic representation. Next, the classification process is done using the SGCNN classifier. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our approach performs admirably across various datasets. In particular, our method achieves the second position among current advanced dictionary-based methods.}

	abstract = {Generally, evaluating the performance offered by an HPC I/O system with different configurations and the same application allows selecting the best settings. This paper proposes to use agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to evaluate the performance of the I/O software stack to allow researchers to choose the best possible configuration without testing the real system. Testing configurations in a simulated environment minimizes the risk of disrupting real systems. In particular, this paper analyzes the communication layer of an HPC I/O system, more specifically the communication layer of the parallel file system (PVFS2). ABMS has been selected because it enables a rapid change in the level of analysis for modeling and implementing a simulator. It can focus on both macro- and micro-levels (how the aggregate behavior of system agents is born and analyzing their individual behavior).}

In this project, we simulate Real Clinical Trials using Virtual Clinical Trials (VCT) for COPD patients, offering possibilities not feasible in traditional trials, such as exploring treatment adherence levels and creating virtual cohorts with specific characteristics. We propose a cohort-based management strategy leveraging data analytics to identify patterns within the COPD patient population and advocate for employing a finite-state machine (FSM) approach to model COPD exacerbations. Further research and validation are crucial to refine and scale this integrated model.}

	abstract = {This study presents a computational framework to investigate and predict the complicated multiphase properties of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for sustainable technological progress. Although their electromechanical properties vary by phase, lead-free piezoelectric materials show a considerable thermo-electromechanical response. Lead-free materials such as Bi\\(_{0.5}\\)Na\\(_{0,5}\\)TiO\\(_{3}\\) (BNT) and other BNT-type piezoelectric materials transition to rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases with temperature variation. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Multiple phases can occur simultaneously under specific thermal, electrical, and mechanical conditions, leading in complex multiphase behaviour. These materials’ performance must be assessed by studying such behaviour. This study uses Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to simulate material micro-domain phase transitions. The computational model for BNT-type piezoelectric material covers temperature-induced ferroelectric domain switching and phase transitions. Therefore, the developed computational approach will assist us in better understanding the influence of these materials’ complex multiphase behaviour on creating sustainable solutions with green technologies.}

One example of the practical engagement is the care taken to minimize emissions of the various greenhouse gases, e.g. carbon dioxide. While e-commerce does not directly affect emissions, it does consume electricity, the generation of which increases the amount of \\(CO_2\\) in the atmosphere. This paper focuses on analyzing the carbon footprint of the top 100 most popular Polish e-shops in order to verify their commitment to sustainability. The research uses a measurement method used in online carbon footprint calculators, which, despite significant simplifications, allows a rough estimate of a website’s impact on carbon dioxide emissions. Nevertheless, the perceived limitations of the algorithm used made it possible to suggest directions for its development, which could significantly affect the accuracy of the calculations.}

Reducing computation time for fast-running continuous model implementations enables efficient development of hybrid models. In the hybrid simulation model, the discrete-event simulation approach was used as one of the components. Technical and conceptual solutions to the observed problems were presented, experiments based on demographic data from the Wrocław region, Poland were performed and it was indicated that an effective hybrid simulation will allow to include additional cause-and-effect relationships in the models.}

	abstract = {Protein thermostability is one of the most important features of bio-engineered proteins with significant scientific and industrial applications. Unfortunately, obtaining thermostable proteins is both expensive and complex. Recent advances in Protein Language Models (pLM) offer promising framework for sequence-to-sequence problems, especially in the realm of protein thermostability prediction. In this work, we present EsmTemp, a transfer learning model based on the ESM-2 pLM architecture. EsmTemp undergoes training on a meticulously curated dataset comprising 24,000 protein sequences with known melting temperatures. A rigorous evaluation, conducted through a 10-fold cross-validation, yields a coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)) of 0.70 and a mean absolute error of 4.3\\(^{\\circ }\\)C. These outcomes highlight how pLM has the potential to advance our understanding of protein thermostability and facilitate the rational design of enzymes for various applications.}

	abstract = {The resiliency of criminal networks against law enforcement interventions has driven researchers to investigate methods of creating accurate simulated criminal networks. Despite these efforts, insights reaching law enforcement agencies remain general and insufficient, warranting a new approach. Therefore, we created CrimeSeen - an interactive visualization and simulation environment for exploring criminal network dynamics using computational models. CrimeSeen empowers law enforcement agencies with the possibility to independently test specific scenarios and identify the most effective disruption strategy before deploying it. CrimeSeen comprises of three components: Citadel, a web-based network visualization and simulation tool serving as the interface; the model, defining rules for criminal network dynamics over time, with the Criminal Cocaine Replacement Model as the use-case in this project; and the simulator, connecting the model and interface and enhancing their functionality through transformations, triggers, and statistics. CrimeSeen was evaluated with sequential usability testing, revealing a positive trend in effectiveness and efficiency over time, with mean scores exceeding 80%. However, user satisfaction did not significantly change and remained below the average for web applications, prompting recommendations for future work.}

	abstract = {Thanks to the broad application fields, learning neural networks is still a more significant problem nowadays. Any attempt in the construction of faster learning algorithms is highly well come. This article presents a new way of learning neural networks with kernels with modified pseudo-inverse learning by modified SVD. The new algorithm constructs the kernels during the learning and estimates the right number in the results. There is no longer a need to define their number of kernels before the learning. This means there is no need to test networks with a number of kernels that is too large, and the number of kernels is no longer a parameter in the selection process (in cross-validation). The results show that the proposed algorithm constructs reasonable kernel bases, and final neural networks are accurate in classification.}

We introduced JDFlow, a novel normalizing flow method to capture multivariate structures in time series data. The framework involves a latent process driven by a neural SDE based on the Merton jump diffusion model. By using maximum likelihood estimation to determine the intensity parameter of the Poisson process in neural SDE, we achieved better results in generating time series data compared to previous methods. We also proposed a new approach to assess synthetic time series quality using a Wasserstein-based similarity measure, which compares signature cross-section distributions of original and generated time series.}

	abstract = {The understanding of large-scale scientific software is a significant challenge due to its diverse codebase, extensive code length, and target computing architectures. The emergence of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), provides novel pathways for understanding such complex scientific codes. This paper presents S3LLM, an LLM-based framework designed to enable the examination of source code, code metadata, and summarized information in conjunction with textual technical reports in an interactive, conversational manner through a user-friendly interface. S3LLM leverages open-source LLaMA-2 models to enhance code analysis through the automatic transformation of natural language queries into domain-specific language (DSL) queries. In addition, S3LLM is equipped to handle diverse metadata types, including DOT, SQL, and customized formats. Furthermore, S3LLM incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LangChain technologies to directly query extensive documents. S3LLM demonstrates the potential of using locally deployed open-source LLMs for the rapid understanding of large-scale scientific computing software, eliminating the need for extensive coding expertise and thereby making the process more efficient and effective. S3LLM is available at https://github.com/ResponsibleAILab/s3llm.}

Iterated codes offer a solution for constructing long codes with a simple coder and decoder. However, a basic iterative code decoder cannot fully exploit the code’s potential, as some error patterns within its correction capacity remain uncorrected. We propose two neural network-assisted decoders: one based on a classical neural network, and the second employing a convolutional neural network. Based on conducted research, we proposed an iterative neural network-based decoder. The resulting decoder demonstrated significantly improved overall performance, exceeding that of the classical decoder, proving the efficient application of neural networks in iterative code decoding.}

Forecasting which tasks gets done in a working week is important because it could help workers understand (i) whether their workload is manageable and (ii) which task scheduling approach helps to maximize the amount of work done and/or minimize the negative consequences of unfinished work. Here we present a working week simulation prototype, R2, and showcase how it can be used to forecast the working week for three archetypical workers. We show that R2 forecasts are sensitive to different task loads, task scheduling strategies and different levels of emerging work complications. We also highlight how R2 supports a new type of validation setting, namely that of user self-validation, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of this new validation approach. We provide R2 as an online platform to allow users to create their own worker profile and task lists, and believe the tool could serve as a starting point for more in-depth research efforts on user-centric working week modelling.}

Such wavefield simulations are suitable for GPUs, which have exhibited improved computational performance in recent years, and the use of GPUs is expected to speed up such simulations. However, available computational performance on GPUs is typically not fully exploited, and the conventional method involves some numerical dispersion. Thus, in this paper, we propose an explicit structured-mesh wavefield simulation method that uses INT8 Tensor Cores and reduces numerical dispersion to speed up computation on GPUs. The proposed method was implemented for GPUs, and its performance was evaluated in a simulation experiment of a real-world problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is 17.0 times faster than the conventional method.}

	abstract = {The ground structure can substantially influence seismic ground motion underscoring the need to develop a ground structure model with sufficient reliability in terms of ground motion estimation for earthquake damage mitigation. While many methods for generating ground structure models have been proposed and used in practice, there remains room for enhancing their reliability. In this study, amid many candidate 3D ground structure models generated from geotechnical engineering knowledge, we propose a method for selecting a credible 3D ground structure model capable of reproducing observed earthquake ground motion, utilizing seismic ground motion data solely observed at the ground surface and employing 3D seismic ground motion analysis. Through a numerical experiment, we illustrate the efficacy of this approach. By conducting \\(10^2\\)–\\(10^3\\) cases of fast 3D seismic wave propagation analyses using graphic processing units (GPUs), we demonstrate that a credible 3D ground structure model is selected according to the quantity of seismic motion information. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that the accuracy of seismic motions using ground structure models that were selected from the pool of candidate models is higher than that using ground structure models that were not selected from the pool of candidate models.}

	abstract = {Accurate retrodictions of the past evolution of convection in the Earth’s mantle are crucial to obtain a qualitative understanding of this central mechanism behind impactful geological events on our planet. They require highly resolved simulations and therefore extremely scalable numerical methods. This paper applies the massively parallel matrix-free finite element framework HyTeG to approximate solutions to stationary Stokes systems and time-dependent, coupled convection problems. It summarizes the underlying mathematical model and verifies the implementation through semi-analytical setups and community benchmarks. The numerical results agree with the expected outcomes from the literature.}

	abstract = {In this article, we propose an accuracy-assuring technique for finding a solution for unsymmetric linear systems. Such problems are related to different areas such as image processing, computer vision, and computational fluid dynamics. Parallel implementation of Krylov subspace methods speeds up finding approximate solutions for linear systems. In this context, the refined approach in pipelined BiCGStab enhances scalability on distributed memory machines, yielding to substantial speed improvements compared to the standard BiCGStab method. However, it’s worth noting that the pipelined BiCGStab algorithm sacrifices some accuracy, which is stabilized with the residual replacement technique. This paper aims to address this issue by employing the ExBLAS-based reproducible approach. We validate the idea on a set of matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.}

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a means of obtaining approximate solutions of partial differential equations and systems through the minimisation of an objective function which includes the evaluation of a residual function at a set of collocation points within the domain. The quality of a PINNs solution depends upon numerous parameters, including the number and distribution of these collocation points. In this paper we consider a number of strategies for selecting these points and investigate their impact on the overall accuracy of the method. In particular, we suggest that no single approach is likely to be “optimal” but we show how a number of important metrics can have an impact in improving the quality of the results obtained when using a fixed number of residual evaluations. We illustrate these approaches through the use of two benchmark test problems: Burgers’ equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.}

	abstract = {Water movement in soil is essential for weather monitoring, prediction of natural disasters, and agricultural water management. Richardson-Richards’ equation (RRE) is the characteristic partial differential equation for studying soil water movement. RRE is a non-linear PDE involving water potential, hydraulic conductivity, and volumetric water content. This equation has underlying non-linear parametric relationships called water retention curves (WRCs) and hydraulic conductivity functions (HCFs). This two-level non-linearity makes the problem of unsaturated water flow of soils challenging to solve. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm to combine physics in data-driven techniques. From noisy or sparse observations of one variable (water potential), we use PINNs to learn the complete system, estimate the parameters of the underlying model, and further facilitate the prediction of infiltration and discharge. We employ training on RRE, WRC, HCF, and measured values to resolve two-level non-linearity directly instead of explicitly deriving water potential or volumetric water content-based formulations. The parameters to be estimated are made trainable with initialized values. We take water potential data from simulations and use this data to solve the inverse problem with PINN and compare estimated parameters, volumetric water content, and hydraulic conductivity with actual values. We chose different types of parametric relationships and wetting conditions to show the approach’s effectiveness.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a training of Physics Informed Neural Networks with fully connected neural networks for approximation of solutions of one-dimensional advection-diffusion problem. In this context, the neural network is interpreted as a non-linear function of one spatial variable, approximating the solution scalar field, namely \\(y=PINN(x)=A_n \\sigma (A_{n-1} ...A_2\\sigma (A_1+b1)+b2)+...+b_{n-1})+b_n\\). In the standard PINN approach, the \\(A_i\\) denotes dense matrices, \\(b_i\\) denotes bias vectors, and \\(\\sigma \\) is the non-linear activation function (sigmoid in our case). In our paper, we consider a case when \\(A_i\\) are hierarchical matrices \\(A_i=\\mathcal{H}_i\\). We assume a structure of our hierarchical matrices approximating the structure of finite difference matrices employed to solve analogous PDEs. In this sense, we propose a hierarchical neural network for training and approximation of PDEs using the PINN method. We verify our method on the example of a one-dimensional advection-diffusion problem.}

	abstract = {Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a class of neural models that are trained by minimizing a combination of the residual of the governing partial differential equation and the initial and boundary data, have gained immense popularity in the natural and engineering sciences. Despite their observed empirical success, an analysis of the training efficiency of residual-driven PINNs at different architecture depths is poorly documented. Usually, neural models used for machine learning tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing have deep architectures, that is, a larger number of hidden layers. In PINNs, we show that for a given trainable parameter count (model size), a shallow network (less layers) converges faster than a deep network (more layers) for the same error characteristics. To illustrate this, we examine the one-dimensional Poisson’s equation and evaluate the gradient for residual and boundary loss terms. We show that the characteristics of the gradient of the loss function are such that for residual loss, shallow architectures converge faster. Empirically, we show the implications of our theory through various experiments.}

Our approach is based upon the observation that matrices generated in this manner are not arbitrary, but inherit properties from differential operators that they discretize. Consequently, we seek to represent a learnable distribution of high-performance preconditioners from a low-dimensional subspace through a carefully-designed autoencoder, which is able to generate SPAI preconditioners for these systems. The concept has been implemented on a variety of finite element discretizations of second- and fourth-order elliptic partial differential equations with highly promising results.}

	abstract = {The following work presents a new method to solve Poisson’s equation and, more generally, sparse linear systems using graph neural networks. We propose a supervised approach to solve the discretized representation of Poisson’s equation at every time step of a simulation. This new method will be applied to plasma physics simulations for Hall-Effect Thruster’s modeling, where the electric potential gradient must be computed to get the electric field necessary to model the plasma’s behavior. Solving Poisson’s equation using classical iterative methods represents a major part of the computational costs in this setting. This is even more critical for unstructured meshes, increasing the problem’s complexity. To accelerate the computational process, we propose a graph neural network to give an initial guess of Poisson’s equation solution. The new method introduced in this article has been designed to handle any meshing structure, including structured and unstructured grids and sparse linear systems. Once trained, the neural network would be used inside a numerical simulation in inference to give an initial guess of the solution for each simulation time step for all right-hand sides of the linear system and all previous time step solutions. In most industrial cases, Hall-Effect thrusters’ modeling requires a large unstructured mesh that one single processor cannot hold regarding memory capacity. We then propose a partitioning strategy to tackle the challenge of solving linear systems on large unstructured grids when they cannot be on a single processor.}

	abstract = {A straightforward way of solving global optimization problems is to find all local optima of the objective function. Therefore, the ability of detecting multiple local optima is a key feature of a practically usable global optimization method. One of such methods is a multi-population evolutionary strategy called the Hierarchic Memetic Strategy (HMS). Although HMS has already proven its global optimization capabilities there is an area for improvement. In this paper we show such an enhancement resulting from the application of the Nearest-Better Clustering. Results of experiments consisting both of curated benchmarks and a real-world inverse problem show that on average the performance is indeed improved compared to the baseline HMS and remains on par with state-of-the-art evolutionary global optimization methods.}

	abstract = {Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is an important task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). While existing state-of-the-art methods primarily leverage pre-trained language models and incorporate external knowledge sources such as confusion sets, they often fall short in fully leveraging local information that surrounds erroneous words. In our research, we aim to bridge a crucial gap by introducing a novel CSC model that is enhanced with a Gaussian attention mechanism. This integration allows the model to adeptly grasp and utilize both contextual and local information. The model incorporates a Gaussian attention mechanism, which results in attention weights around erroneous words following a Gaussian distribution. This enables the model to place more emphasis on the information from neighboring words. Additionally, the attention weights are dynamically adjusted using learnable hyperparameters, allowing the model to adaptively allocate attention to different parts of the input sequence. In the end, we adopt a homophonic substitution masking strategy and fine-tune the BERT model on a large-scale CSC corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the SIGHAN benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Augmented reality may soon revolutionize the world we live in. The incorporation of computer simulations into augmented reality glasses opens new perspectives for the perception of reality. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of performing numerical simulations in real time within augmented reality glasses. We present the technology that can be successfully employed in the real-life simulations of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) based phenomena. We designed and implemented a two- and three-dimensional explicit dynamics solver in Lens Studio using Finite Difference Method (FDM) on the augmented reality glasses. We performed tests on the computational cost, memory usage, and the capability of performing real-life simulations of advection-diffusion and wave propagation problems.}

	abstract = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial problem in many industrial and research applications. Timely detection of anomalies allows, for instance, to prevent defects in manufacturing processes and failures in cyberphysical systems. Deep learning methods are preferred among others for their accuracy and robustness for the analysis of complex multivariate data. However, a key aspect is being able to extract predictions in a timely manner, to accommodate real-time requirements in different applications. In the case of deep learning models, model reduction is extremely important to achieve optimal results in real-time systems with limited time and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a compression method for deep autoencoders that involves three key factors. First, pruning reduces the number of weights, while preventing catastrophic drops in accuracy by means of a fast search process that identifies high sparsity levels. Second, linear and non-linear quantization reduces model complexity by reducing the number of bits for every single weight. The combined contribution of these three aspects allow the model size to be reduced, by removing a subset of the weights (pruning), and decreasing their bit-width (quantization). As a result, the compressed model is faster and easier to adopt in highly constrained hardware environments. Experiments performed on popular multivariate anomaly detection benchmarks, show that our method is capable of achieving significant model compression ratio (between 80% and 95%) without a significant reduction in the anomaly detection performance.}

	abstract = {This research presents an efficient computational method for retrofitting of buildings by employing an active learning-based ensemble machine learning (AL-Ensemble ML) approach developed in OpenSees, Python and MATLAB. The results of the study shows that the AL-Ensemble ML model provides the most accurate estimations of interstory drift (ID) and residual interstory drift (RID) for steel structures using a dataset of 2-, to 9-story steel structures considering four soil type effects. To prepare the dataset, 3584 incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) were performed on 64 structures. The research employs 6-, and 8-story structures to validate the AL-Ensemble ML model's effectiveness, showing it achieves the highest accuracy among conventional ML models, with an R2 of 98.4%. Specifically, it accurately predicts the RID of floor levels in a 6-story structure with an accuracy exceeding 96.6%. Additionally, the programming code identifies the specific damaged floor level in a building, facilitating targeted local retrofitting instead of retrofitting the entire structure promising a reduction in retrofitting costs while enhancing prediction accuracy.}
