	abstract = {Unlike the primary condition under investigation, the term comorbidities define coexisting medical conditions that influence patient care during detection, therapy, and outcome. Tuberculosis continues to be one of the 10 leading causes of death globally. The aim of the study is to present the exploration of classic data mining techniques to find relationships between the outcome of TB cases (cure or death) and the comorbidities presented by the patient. The data are provided by TBWEB and represent TB cases in the territory of the state of SÃ£o Paulo-Brazil, from 2006 to 2016. Techniques of feature selection and classification models were explored. As shown in the results, it was found high relevance for AIDS and alcoholism as comorbidities in the outcome of TB cases. Although the classifier performance did not present a significant statistical difference, there was a great reduction in the number of attributes and in the number of rules generated, showing, even more, the high relevance of the attributes: age group, AIDS, and other immunology in the classification of the outcome of TB cases. The explored techniques proved to be promising to support searching for unclear relationships in the TB context, providing, on average, a 73% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the cases according to characteristics that were analyzed.}

	abstract = {Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a severe disease characterized by an elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The gold standard for PH diagnosis is measurement of mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mPAP) during an invasive Right Heart Catheterization. In this paper, we investigate noninvasive approach to PH detection utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computer Models and Machine Learning. We show using the ablation study, that physics-informed feature engineering based on models of blood circulation increases the performance of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees-based algorithms for classification of PH and regression of values of mPAP. We compare results of regression (with thresholding of estimated mPAP) and classification and demonstrate that metrics achieved in both experiments are comparable. The predicted mPAP values are more informative to the physicians than the probability of PH returned by classification models. They provide the intuitive explanation of the outcome of the machine learning model (clinicians are accustomed to the mPAP metric, contrary to the PH probability).}

	abstract = {Within the area of bioinformatics, Deep Learning (DL) models have shown exceptional results in applications in which histological images, scans and tomographies are used. However, when gene expression data is under analysis, the performance is often limited, further hampered by the complexity of these models that require several instances, in the order of thousands, to provide good results. Due to the difficulty and the costs involved in the collection of medical data, the application of Data Augmentation (DA) techniques to alleviate the lack of samples is a topic of great relevance. State-of-the-art models based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and some introduced modifications are used in this work to investigate the effect of DA for prediction of the vital status of patients from RNA-Seq gene expression data. Experimental results on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models. The application of DA methods significantly increase prediction accuracy, leading by 12% with respect to benchmark data sets and 3.15% with respect to data processed with feature selection. Results based on CGAN models outperform in most cases, alternative methods like the SMOTE or noise injection techniques.}

	abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, rare diseases currently represent a global public health priority. Although it has a low prevalence in the general population, this type of condition collectively affects up to 10% of the entire world population. Therefore, these pathologies are numerous and of a diverse nature, and some factors imply significant challenges for public health, such as the lack of structured and standardized knowledge about rare diseases in health units, the need for communication between multidisciplinary teams to understand phenomena and definition of accurate diagnoses, and the scarcity of experience on specific treatments. In addition, the often chronic and degenerative nature of these diseases generates a significant social and economic impact. This paper aims to present an initiative to develop a network of specialized reference centers for rare diseases in Brazil, covering all country regions. We propose collecting, mapping, analyzing data, and supporting effective communication between such centers to share clinical knowledge, evolution, and patient needs, through well-defined and standardized processes. We used validated structures to ensure data privacy and protection from participating health facilities to create this digital system. We also applied systems lifecycle methodologies, data modeling techniques, and quality management. Currently, the retrospective stage of the project is in its final phase, and some preliminary results can be verified. We developed an intuitive web portal for consulting the information collected, offering filters for personalized queries on rare diseases in Brazil to support evidence-based public decision-making.}

	abstract = {An abnormal growth develop in female uterus is uterus fibroids. Sometimes these fibroids may cause severe problems like miscarriage. If this fibroids are not detected it ultimately grows in size and numbers. Among different image modalities, ultrasound is more efficient to detect uterus fibroids. This paper proposes a model in deep learning for fibroid detection with many advantages. The proposed deep learning model overpowers the drawbacks of the existing methodologies of fibroid detection in all stages like noise removal, contrast enhancement, Classification. The preprocessed image is classified into two classes of data: fibroid and non-fibroid, which is done using the MBF-CDNN method. The method is validated using the parameters Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F-measure. It is found that the sensitivity is 94.44%, specificity 95% and accuracy 94.736%.}

	abstract = {Enormous potential of artificial intelligence (AI) exists in numerous products and services, especially in healthcare and medical technology. Explainability is a central prerequisite for certification procedures around the world and the fulfilment of transparency obligations. Explainability tools increase the comprehensibility of object recognition in images using Convolutional Neural Networks, but lack precision. This paper adapts FastCAM for the domain of detection of medical instruments in endoscopy images. The results show that the Domain Adapted (DA)-FastCAM provides better results for the focus of the model than standard FastCAM weights.}

	abstract = {Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) has variable clinical presentation with significant treatment costs and gaps in the evidence-base to support clinical decision making. The contribution of variations in venous anatomy to the risk of complications following treatment has yet to be characterized in detail. We report the development of a steady-state, 0D model of venous anatomy of the lower limb and assessments of local sensitivity (10% radius variation) and global sensitivity (50% radius variation) of the resulting flows to variability in venous anatomy. An analysis of orthogonal sensitivity was also performed. Local sensitivity analysis was repeated with four degrees of thrombosis in the left common iliac vein. The largest normalised sensitivities were observed in locations associated with the venous return. Both local and global approaches provided similar ranking of input parameters responsible for the variation of flow in a vessel where thrombosis is typically observed. When a thrombus was included in the model increase in absolute sensitivity was observed in the leg affected by the thrombosis. These results can be used to inform model reduction strategies and to target clinical data collection.}

	abstract = {Niemann-Pick Class 1 (NPC1) disease is a rare and neurodegenerative disease, and often metabolomics datasets of NPC1 patients are limited in the number of samples and severely imbalanced. In order to improve the predictive capability and identify new biomarkers in an NPC1 disease urinary dataset, data augmentation (DA) techniques based on computational intelligence are employed to create additional synthetic samples. This paper presents DA techniques, based on the addition of noise, on oversampling techniques and using conditional generative adversarial networks, to evaluate their predictive capacities on a set of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) profiles of urine samples. Prediction results obtained show increases in sensitivity (30%) and in F\\(_{1}\\) score (20%). In addition, multivariate data analysis and variable importance in projection scores have been applied. These analyses show the ability of the DA methods to replicate the information of the metabolites and determined that selected metabolites (such as 3-aminoisobutyrate, 3-hidroxivaleric, quinolinate and trimethylamine) may be valuable biomarkers for the diagnosis of NPC1 disease.}

It is a \n scoring system that is an interpretable machine learning classification model optimized for performance. Scoring systems are commonly used in healthcare and justice. We implement feature discretization (FD) in the hyperparameter optimization process to improve classification performance and refer to the new approach as FD-RiskSLIM. We test the approach using two medical applications. We compare the results of FD-RiskSLIM, RiskSLIM, and other machine learning (ML) models. We demonstrate that scoring models based on RiskSLIM, in addition to being interpretable, perform at least on par with the state-of-the-art ML models such as Gradient Boosting in terms of classification metrics. We show the superiority of FD-RiskSLIM over RiskSLIM.}

	abstract = {This study presents two methods to support the treatment process of inpatients with COVID-19. The first method is designed to predict treatment outcomes; this method is based on machine learning models and probabilistic graph models of patient clustering. The method demonstrates high quality in terms of predictive models, and the structure of the graph model is supported by knowledge from practical medicine and other studies. The method is used as a basis for finding the optimal intervention plan for severe patients. This plan is a set of interventions for patients that are optimal in terms of minimizing the probability of mortality. We tested the method for critically ill patients (item 4.5) and for 30% of all patients with lethal outcomes the methods found an intervention plan that leads to recovery as a treatment outcome as predicted. Both methods show high quality, and after validation by physicians, this method can be used as part of a decision support system for medical professionals working with COVID-19 patients.}

	abstract = {Heart attack (HA) is a sudden health disorder when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heart attack is one of the greatest causes of death and disability globally. Early recognition of the various warning signs of a HA can help reduce the severity. Different machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the heart attack. However, patients with arterial hypertension (AH) are especially prone to this disorder and have several features that distinguish them from other groups of patients. We apply these features to develop a special model for people suffering from AH. Moreover, we contribute to this field bringing more transparency to the modelling using interpretable machine learning. We also compare the patterns learned by methods with prior information used in heart attack scales and evaluate their efficiency.}

	abstract = {The readmission rate is an important indicator of the hospital quality of care. With the upsetting increase in readmission rates worldwide, especially in geriatric patients, predicting unplanned readmissions becomes a very important task, that can help to improve the patientâs well-being and reduce healthcare costs. With the aim of reducing hospital readmission, more attention is to be paid to home healthcare services, since home healthcare patients on average have more compromised health conditions. Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence algorithms were used to develop predictive models using MIMIC-IV repository. Developed predictive models account for various patient details, including demographical, administrative, disease-related and prescription-related data. Categorical features were encoded with a novel customized target encoding approach to improve the model performance avoiding data leakage and overfitting. This new risk-score based target encoding approach demonstrated similar performance to existing target encoding and Bayesian encoding approaches, with reduced data leakage, when assessed using Gini-importance. Developed models demonstrated good discriminative performance, AUC 0.75, TPR 0.69 TNR 0.67 for the best model. These encouraging results, as well as an effective feature engineering approach, can be used in further studies to develop more reliable 30-day readmission predictive models.}

	abstract = {In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a pressing need for an expansion of the ventilator capacity in response to the COVID19 pandemic. Reserved for dire situations, ventilator splitting is complex, and has previously been limited to patients with similar pulmonary compliances and tidal volume requirements. To address this need, we developed a system to enable rapid and efficacious splitting between two or more patients with varying lung compliances and tidal volume requirements. We present here a computational framework to both drive device design and inform patient-specific device tuning. By creating a patient- and ventilator-specific airflow model, we were able to identify pressure-controlled splitting as preferable to volume-controlled as well create a simulation-guided framework to identify the optimal airflow resistor for a given patient pairing. In this work, we present the computational model, validation of the model against benchtop test lungs and standard-of-care ventilators, and the methods that enabled simulation of over 200 million patient scenarios using 800,000 compute hours in a 72\xa0h period.}

	abstract = {The processes of neurodegeneration related to Alzheimerâs disease (AD) begin several decades before the first symptoms. We have used granular computing rules (rough set theory) to classify cognitive data from BIOCARD study that have been started over 20\xa0years ago with 354 normal subjects. Patients were evaluated every year by team of neuropsychologists and neurologists and classified as normal, with MCI (mild cognitive impairments), or with dementia. As the decision attribute we have used CDRSUM (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes) as more quantitative measure than above classification. Based on 150 stable subjects with different stages of AD we have found rules (granules) that classify cognitive attributes with disease stages (CDRSUM). By applying these rules to normal (CDRSUM\u2009=\u20090) 21 subjects we have predicted that one subject might get mild dementia (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20094.5), one very mild dementia (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20092.25), and five other might get questionable impairment (CDRSUM\u2009>\u20090.75). AI methods can find, invisible for neuropsychologists, patterns in cognitive attributes of normal subjects that might indicate their pre-dementia stage.}

Imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) allows HR detection from video recordings and its unbeatable compliance over the state of art methods has made much attention among researchers. Since it is a camera-based technique, measurement accuracy depends on the quality of input images. In this paper, we present a pipeline for efficient measurement of HR that includes a learning-based super-resolution preprocessing step. This preprocessing image enhancement step has shown promising results on low-resolution input images and works better on iPPG algorithms.

It comprises a detailed agentâbased model coupled with SEIR-type compartmental model. While the former makes it possible to simulate the initial phase of an outbreak when the heterogeneity of the contact network is crucial, the latter approximates the disease dynamics after the occurrence of mass infection thus dramatically increasing the framework performance. The numerical experiments with the model are presented and their results are discussed.}

	abstract = {Complex temporal epilepsy belongs to the most common type of brain disorder. Nevertheless, the wave patterns of this type of seizure, especially associated with behavioral changes, are difficult to interpret clinically. A helpful tool seems to be the statistical and time-frequency analysis of modeled epilepsy signals. The main goal of the study is the application of the Van der Pol model oscillator to study brain activity and intra-individual variability during complex temporal seizures registered in one patient. The achievement of the article is the confirmation that the statistical analysis of optimal values of three pairs of parameters of the duffing Van der Pol oscillator model enables the differentiation of the individual phases of the seizure in short-period seizure waves. In addition, the article attempts to compare the real signals recorded during the attack and modeled using frequency and time-frequency analysis. Similarities of power spectra and entropy samples of real and generated signals in low-frequency values are noted, and differences in higher values are explained about the clinical interpretation of the records.}

	abstract = {Imperfect manufacturing is one of the factors affecting the performance of antenna systems. It is particularly important when design specifications are strict and leave a minimum leeway for a degradation caused by geometry or material parameter deviations from their nominal values. At the same time, conventional antenna design procedures routinely neglect to take the fabrication tolerances into account, which is mainly a result of a challenging nature of uncertainty quantification. Nevertheless, the ability to assess the effects of parameter deviations and to mitigate thereof is instrumental in achieving truly robust antenna designs. Furthermore, identifying the antenna-specific relationships between nominal requirements and tolerance immunity is essential to determine the necessary levels of fabrication accuracy, which affects the both the reliability and the manufacturing costs. This paper proposes a technique for multi-criterial optimization of antenna structures oriented towards rendering a family of designs representing trade-offs between the nominal performance and the robustness. The fundamental components of our procedure are feature-based regression models constructed at the level of selected characteristics points of the antenna outputs. The trade-off designs are generated sequentially, using local search carried out for gradually relaxed nominal requirements. Numerical experiments conducted for two microstrip antennas demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of yielding the performance/robustness Pareto set at the cost of only a few dozens of EM analysis of the antenna at hand per design, while ensuring reliability, as validated by means of EM-based Monte Carlo simulation.}

Nonetheless, as reliable evaluation of microwave device characteristics requires full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis, optimization procedures tend to be computationally expensive, to the extent of being prohibitive when using conventional algorithms. Accelerating EM-driven optimization is therefore a matter of practical necessity. This paper proposes a novel approach to reduced-cost gradient-based parameter tuning of passive microwave circuits with numerical derivatives. Our technique is based on restricting the finite-differentiation (FD)-based sensitivity updates to a small set of principal directions, identified as having the most significant effect on the circuit responses over the frequency bands of interest. The principal directions are found in the form of an orthonormal basis, using an auxiliary optimization process repeated before each iteration of the optimization algorithm. Extensive verification experiments conducted using a compact branch-line coupler and a dual-band power divider demonstrate up to fifty percent speedup obtained over the reference algorithm (using full FD sensitivity updates), as well as a considerable improvement over several accelerated algorithms. The computational savings are obtained with negligible degradation of the design quality.}

	abstract = {Accurate information about real estate in the city, and about residential buildings in particular, is the most important resource for managing the development of the urban environment. Information about residential buildings, for example, the number of residents, is used in the inventory and digitization of the urban economy and subsequently becomes the basis of digital platforms for managing urban processes. Inventory of urban property can be carried out independently by different departments within the framework of official functions, which leads to the problem of conflicting information and missing values in urban data, in building data in particular. These problems are especially pronounced when information from different sources is combined to create centralized repositories and digital twins of the city. This leads to the need to develop approaches to filling missing values and correcting distorted information about residential buildings. As part of this work, the authors propose an approach to data imputation of residential buildings, including additional information about the environment. The analysis of the effectiveness of the approach is based on data collected for St. Petersburg (Russia).}

	abstract = {Modern microwave design has become heavily reliant on full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools, which are necessary for accurate evaluation of microwave components. Consequently, it is also indispensable for their development, especially the adjustment of geometry parameters, oriented towards performance improvement. However, EM-driven optimization procedures incur considerable computational expenses, which may become impractical even in the case of local tuning, and prohibitive whenever global search is vital (e.g., multi-model tasks, simulation-based miniaturization, circuit re-design within extended ranges of operating frequencies). This work presents a novel approach to a computationally-efficient globalized parameter tuning of microwave components. Our framework employs the response feature technology, along with the inverse surrogate models. The latter permit low-cost exploration of the parameter space, and identification of the most advantageous regions that contain designs featuring performance parameters sufficiently close to the assumed target. The initial parameter vectors rendered in such a way undergo then local, gradient-based tuning. The incorporation of response features allows for constructing the inverse model using small training data sets due to simple (weakly-nonlinear) relationships between the operating parameters and dimensions of the circuit under design. Global optimization of the two microstrip components (a coupler and a power divider) is carried out for the sake of verification. The results demonstrate global search capability, excellent success rate, as well as remarkable efficiency with the average optimization cost of about a hundred of EM simulations of the circuit necessary to conclude the search process.}

	abstract = {Soil bacteria play a fundamental role in plant growth. This paper focuses on developing and testing some techniques designed to identify automatically such microorganisms. More specifically, the recognition performed here deals with the specific five genera of soil bacteria. Their microscopic images are classified with machine learning methods using shape and image texture descriptors. Feature determination based on shape relies on interpolation and curvature estimation whereas feature recognition based on image texture resorts to the spatial relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels using co-occurrence matrices. From the variety of modelling methods applied here the best reported result amounts to 97% of accuracy. This outcome is obtained upon incorporating the set of features from both groups and subsequently merging classification and feature selection methods: Extreme Learning Machine - Radial Basis Function with Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression with Bayesian Regularization and also k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with Fast Correlation Based Filter. The optimal parameters involved in merged classifiers are obtained upon computational testing and simulation.}

	abstract = {The study introduces a System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) approach with a remote Group Model Building (GMB) component used as an answer to the climate problems of cities related to severe air pollution. The main objective of our research is twofold: to identify the factors and mechanisms that are key for the elimination of fossil-fuel boilers (FFBs) in Poland and to provide a system understanding of the underlying causal relationships and their implications to facilitate eradication of FFBs. The first phase of modelling process is presented: action research represented by remote GMB workshops, attended by 14 participants from Poland and Norway. The workshopsâ results help to identify the key variables, capture the main causal relationships between them, helping to develop the first outline of the causal structure to underlie the simulation model. Despite holding the workshops during social isolation, they proved to be good educational facilitation tool for a key element of the modelling process in the SD methodology - the collection of input data for model building, as well as raising participantsâ awareness of climate change issues. The novelty of the study lies in the application of a proven tool such as dynamic systems modelling to applied research for sustainable development. In particular, using modelling and simulation approaches to support development and practical implementation of the energy transition policies involving the elimination of FFBs and replacement with renewable energy sources. To the best of our knowledge, only a few such studies are being conducted.}

	abstract = {Large concentrations of particulate matter in residential areas are related to the lack of vertical movements of air masses. Their disappearance is associated with the occurrence of the most common ground temperature inversion, which inhibits the natural air convection. As a result, air layers separated by a temperature inversion layer are formed, which practically do not interact with each other. Therefore, to reduce the concentration of particulate matter, mixing of air layers should be forced, or natural processes should be restored. For this purpose, it was proposed to generate shock waves of high pressure in the vertical direction to mix the polluted air and break the inversion layer locally. This paper performs fast isogeometric analysis simulations of the thermal inversion and pollution removal process. We employ a linear computational cost solver using Kronecker product-based factorization. We compare our numerical simulations to an experiment performed with an anti-hail cannon in a highly polluted city of KrakÃ³w, Poland.}

	abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are computational models that represent how factors (nodes) change over discrete steps based on causal impacts (weighted directed edges) from other factors. This approach has traditionally been used as an aggregate, similarly to System Dynamics, to depict the functioning of a system. There has been a growing interest in taking this aggregate approach at the individual-level, for example by equipping each agent of an Agent-Based Model with its own FCM to express its behavior. Although frameworks and studies have already taken this approach, an ongoing limitation has been the difficulty of creating as many FCMs as there are individuals. Indeed, current studies have been able to create agents whose traits are different, but whose decision-making modules are often identical, thus limiting the behavioral heterogeneity of the simulated population. In this paper, we address this limitation by using Genetic Algorithms to create one FCM for each agent, thus providing the means to automatically create a virtual population with heterogeneous behaviors. Our algorithm builds on prior work from Stach and colleagues by introducing additional constraints into the process and applying it over longitudinal, individual-level data. A case study from a real-world intervention on nutrition confirms that our approach can generate heterogeneous agents that closely follow the trajectories of their real-world human counterparts. Future works include technical improvements such as lowering the computational time of the approach, or case studies in computational intelligence that use our virtual populations to test new behavior change interventions.}

	abstract = {Changes in the demographic structure of the population have imposed alterations in the pension systems. In many countries, including Poland, the amount of retirement benefits is highly dependent on life expectancy, which in the case of increases in longevity leads to a decrease in accrued benefits. A dynamic Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to investigate the financial implications of the aging problem in connection with the previously unexpected demographic changes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic on future pension payments. The model uses data from Polish statistical databases. The study distinguishes different life cycle profiles, i.e. women and men with average and minimum wage earnings. Simulation experiments are conducted in two variants. The first variant takes into account the currently registered shortening of life expectancy, while the second variant assumes that life expectancy is continuously lengthening, as it was observed until the outbreak of the Covid-19 epidemic. The simulation results show that the Covid-19 pandemic has a beneficial effect for future retirees, which is reflected in the expected higher replacement rates at retirement.}

	abstract = {A new surrogate-assisted dynamic programming based optimal path search algorithm â studied in the context of high-performance sailing â is shown to be both effective and (energy) efficient. The key elements in achieving this â the fast and accurate physics-based surrogate model, the integrated refinement of the solution space and simulation model fidelity, and the OpenCL-based spmd-parallelisation of the algorithm â are presented in detail. The included numerical results show the high accuracy of the surrogate model (relative approximation error medians smaller than \\(0.85\\%\\)), its efficacy in terms of computing time reduction (from 39.2 to 45.4 times), and the high speedup of the parallel algorithm (from 5.5 to 54.2). Combining these effects gives (up to) 2461 times faster execution. The proposed approach can also be applied to other domains. It can be considered as a dynamic programming based optimal path planning framework parameterised by a problem specific (potentially variable-fidelity) cost-function evaluator (surrogate).}

The local search is used randomly with some probability instead of the standard crossover procedure in order to generate a new individual. We analyze injecting the local search in two situations: to resolve the conflicts and also without a conflict with a certain probability. The discussed mechanisms improve the obtained results and significantly accelerate the calculations. Moreover, we show that there exists an optimal degree of the local search component, and it depends on the particular crossover operator.}

The underlying motivation is the constant increase in the demand for network traffic due to the development of new access technologies (5G, FTTH), which require particularly large amounts of bandwidth. The aim of this paper is to numerically calculate a transformation that allows determining probability distributions of network edge traffic based on known probability distributions of demand matrix elements. Statistical methods confirmed the proposed transformation. The study is performed for a practically relevant network within selected scenarios determined by realistic traffic demand sets.}

	abstract = {Modelling of large scale data series is of significant importance in fields such as astrophysics and finance. The continuous increase in available data requires new computational approaches such as the use of multicore processors and accelerators. Recently, a novel time series modelling and forecasting method was proposed, based on a recursively updated pseudoinverse matrix which enhances parsimony by enabling assessment of basis functions, before inclusion into the final model. Herewith, a novel GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) accelerated matrix based auto-regressive variant is presented, which utilizes lagged versions of a time series and interactions between them to form a model. The original approach is reviewed and a matrix multiplication based variant is proposed. The GPU accelerated and hybrid parallel versions are introduced, utilizing single and mixed precision arithmetic to increase GPU performance. Discussions around performance improvement and high order interactions are given. A block processing approach is also introduced to reduce memory requirements for the accelerator. Furthermore, the inclusion of constraints in the computation of weights, corresponding to the basis functions, with respect to the parallel implementation are discussed. The approach is assessed in a series of model problems and discussions are provided.}

	abstract = {Triangles are an essential part of network analysis, representing metrics such as transitivity and clustering coefficient. Using the correspondence between sparse adjacency matrices and graphs, linear algebraic methods have been developed for triangle counting and enumeration, where the main computational kernel is sparse matrix-matrix multiplication. In this paper, we use an intersection representation of graph data implemented as a sparse matrix, and engineer an algorithm to compute the âk-countâ distribution of the triangles of the graph. The main computational task of computing sparse matrix-vector products is carefully crafted by employing compressed vectors as accumulators. Our method avoids redundant work by counting and enumerating each triangle exactly once. We present results from extensive computational experiments on large-scale real-world and synthetic graph instances that demonstrate good scalability of our method. In terms of run-time performance, our algorithm has been found to be orders of magnitude faster than the reference implementations of the miniTri data analytics application [18].}

	abstract = {This work proposes a novel adaptive global surrogate modeling algorithm which uses two neural networks, one for prediction and the other for the model uncertainty. Specifically, the algorithm proceeds in cycles and adaptively enhances the neural network-based surrogate model by selecting the next sampling points guided by an auxiliary neural network approximation of the spatial error. The proposed algorithm is tested numerically on the one-dimensional Forrester function and the two-dimensional Branin function. The results demonstrate that global surrogate modeling using neural network-based function prediction can be guided efficiently and adaptively using a neural network approximation of the model uncertainty.}

SD is a technique that utilizes Monte Carlo simulations and distribution decomposition to visually evaluate the source and the outcome of different portions of data. Here, SD is applied to three distinct processes: a model problem, a nondestructive evaluation testing system, and an agricultural food-water-energy system. The results demonstrate successful implementations of SD for the different systems, and the illustrate the potential of SD to support new understanding of cause and effect relationships in complex systems.}

	abstract = {Performing global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can be challenging due to the combined effect of the high computational cost, but it is also essential for engineering decision making. To reduce this cost, surrogate modeling such as neural networks (NNs) are used to replace the expensive simulation model in the GSA process, which introduces the additional challenge of finding the minimum number of training data samples required to train the NNs accurately. In this work, a recently proposed NN-based GSA algorithm to accurately quantify the sensitivities is improved. The algorithm iterates over the number of samples required to train the NNs and terminates using an outer-loop sensitivity convergence criteria. The iterative surrogate-based GSA yields converged values for the Sobolâ indices and, at the same time, alleviates the specification of arbitrary accuracy metrics for the NN-based approximation model. In this paper, the algorithm is improved by enhanced NN modeling, which lead to an overall acceleration of the GSA process. The improved algorithm is tested numerically on problems involving an analytical function with three input parameters, and a simulation-based nondestructive evaluation problem with three input parameters.}

The simulation tests were carried out using real data from the factory shop-floor, services prepared for production monitoring, allowing the calculation of KPIs. The correctness of the solution is confirmed on 20 production units by comparing its results with the blackboard architecture using SQL queries.

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for fitting the boundary geometry with BÃ©zier curves in the parametric integral equation system (PIES). The algorithm determines the coordinates of control points by minimizing the distance between the constructed curves and contour points on the boundary. The minimization is done with the Adam optimizer that uses the gradient of the objective function calculated by automatic differentiation (AD). Automatic differentiation eliminates error-prone manual routines to evaluate symbolic derivatives. The algorithm automatically adjusts to the actual number of curves and their degrees. The presented tests show high accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting boundary may be directly used by the PIES to solve the boundary value problem in 2D governed by the Laplace equation.}

	abstract = {A component-based view of metaheuristics has recently been promoted to deal with several problems in the field of metaheuristic research. These problems include inconsistent metaphor usage, non-standard terminology and a proliferation of metaheuristics that are often insignificant variations on a theme. These problems make the identification of novel metaheuristics, performance-based comparisons, and selection of metaheuristics difficult. The central problem for the component-based view is the identification of components of a metaheuristic. This paper proposes the use of taxonomies to guide the identification of metaheuristic components. We developed a general and rigorous method, TAXONOG-IMC, that takes as input an appropriate taxonomy and guides the user to identify components. The method is described in detail, an example application of the method is given, and an analysis of its usefulness is provided. The analysis shows that the method is effective and provides insights that are not possible without the proper identification of the components.\n}

	abstract = {In the context of humanitarian support for forcibly displaced persons, camps play an important role in protecting people and ensuring their survival and health. A challenge in this regard is to find optimal locations for establishing a new asylum-seeker/unrecognized refugee or IDPs (internally displaced persons) camp. In this paper we formulate this problem as an instantiation of the well-known facility location problem (FLP) with three objectives to be optimized. In particular, we show that AI techniques and migration simulations can be used to provide decision support on camp placement.}

	abstract = {A classical NP-hard problem is the Minimum Edge Clique Cover (minECC) problem, which is concerned with covering the edges of a network (graph) with the minimum number of cliques. There are many real-life applications of this problem, such as in food science, computational biology, efficient representation of pairwise information, and so on. Borrowing ideas from [8], we propose using a compact representation, the intersection representation, of network data and design an efficient and scalable algorithm for minECC. Edges are considered for inclusion in cliques in degree-based orders during the clique construction step. The intersection representation of the input graph enabled efficient computer implementation of the algorithm by utilizing an existing sparse matrix package [11]. We present results from numerical experiments on a representative set of real-world and synthetically constructed benchmark graph instances. Our algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm of [4] in terms of the quality of the edge clique covers returned and running time performance on the benchmark test instances. On some of the largest graph instances whilst existing heuristics failed to terminate, our algorithm could finish the computation within a reasonable amount of time.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, geo-based social group activities have become popular because of the availability of geo-location information. In this paper, we propose a novel Geo-Social Team Formation framework using DSCAN, named DSCAN-GSTF, for impromptu activities, aim to find a group of individuals closest to a location where service requires quickly. The group should be socially cohesive for better collaboration and spatially close to minimize the preparation time. To imitate the real-world scenario, the DSCAN-GSTF framework considers various criteria which can provide effective Geo-Social groups, including a required list of skills, the minimum number of each skill, contribution capacity, and the weight of the userâs skills. The existing geo-social models ignore the expertise level of individuals and fail to process a large geo-social network efficiently, which is highly important for an urgent service request. In addition to considering expertise level in our model, we also utilize the DSCAN method to create clusters in parallel machines, which makes the searching process very fast in large networks. Also, we propose a polynomial parametric network flow algorithm to check the skills criteria, which boosts the searching speed of our model. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on real datasets to determine a competitive solution compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Science collaborations such as ATLAS at the high-energy particle accelerator at CERN use a computer grid to run expensive computational tasks on massive, distributed data sets. Dealing with big data on a grid demands workload management and data allocation to maintain a continuous workflow. Data allocation in a computer grid necessitates some data placement policy that is conditioned on the resources of the system and the usage of data. In part, automatic and manual data policies shall achieve a short time-to-result. There are efforts to improve data policies. Data placement/allocation is vital to coping with the increasing amount of data processing in different data centers. A data allocation/placement policy decides which locations sub-sets of data are to be placed. In this paper, a novel approach copes with the bottleneck related to wide-area file transfers between data centers and large distributed data sets with high dimensionality. The model estimates similar data with a neural network on sparse and uncertain observations and then proceeds with the allocation process. The allocation process comprises evolutionary data allocation for finding near-optimal solutions and improves over 5% on network transfers for the given data centers.}

	abstract = {Session-based recommendation aims at predicting the next item given a series of historical items a user interacts with in a session. Many works try to make use of social network to achieve a better recommendation performance. However, existing works treat the weights of user edges as the same and thus neglect the differences of social influences among users in a social network, for each userâs social circle differs widely. In this work, we try to utilize an explicit way to describe the impact of social influence in recommender system. Specially, we build a heterogeneous graph, which is composed of users and items nodes. We argue that the fewer neighbors users have, the more likely users may be influenced by neighbors, and different neighbors may have various influences on users. Hence weights of user edges are computed to characterize different influences of social circles on users in a recommendation simulation. Moreover, based on the number of followers and PageRank score of each user, we introduce various computing methods for weights of user edges from a comprehensive perspective. Extensive experiments performed on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Understanding playerâs actions and activities in sports is crucial to analyze player and team performance. Within Australian Rules football, such data is typically captured manually by multiple (paid) spectators working for sports data analytics companies. This data is augmented with data from GPS tracking devices in player clothing. This paper focuses on exploring the feasibility of action recognition in Australian rules football through deep learning and use of 3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs). We identify several key actions that players perform: kick, pass, mark and contested mark, as well as non-action events such as images of the crowd or players running with the ball. We explore various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and developed a custom data set containing over 500 video clips targeted specifically to Australian rules football. We fine-tune a variety of models and achieve a top-1 accuracy of 77.45% using R2+1D ResNet-152. We also consider team and player identification and tracking using You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a deep association metric (DeepSORT) algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the topic of action recognition in Australian rules football.}

	abstract = {Stance detection is an important task in opinion mining, which aims to determine whether the author of a text is in favor of, against, or neutral towards a specific target. By now, the scarcity of annotations is one of the remaining problems in stance detection. In this paper, we propose a Stance-Emotion joint Data Augmentation with Gradual Prompt-tuning (SEGP) model to address this problem. In order to generate more training samples, we propose an auxiliary sentence based Stance-Emotion joint Data Augmentation (SEDA) method, formulate data augmentation as a conditional masked language modeling task. We leverage different relations between stance and emotion to construct auxiliary sentences. SEDA generates augmented samples by predicting the masked words conditioned on both their context and auxiliary sentences. Furthermore, we propose a Gradual Prompt-tuning method to make better use of the augmented samples, which is a combination of prompt-tuning and curriculum learning. Specifically, the model starts by training on only original samples, then adds augmented samples as training progresses. Experimental results show that SEGP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

Even a single image feature can describe the impression value with good precision (significant strong relationship, Pearson \\(r>\\)\xa00,5). Best results were obtained using by combining several image features using multiple regression (significant very strong positive relationship, Pearson r = 0,82 at best). We also analyze the different set of image features at different level design stages (from blockout to final design) where significant correlation (strong to very strong) was observed regardless of the level design variant. Thanks to the study results, the user impression of virtual 3D space, can be estimated with a high degree of certainty by automatic evaluation using image analysis.}

	abstract = {Automated interpretation of digital images of charts in documents and the internet helps to improve the accessibility of visual representation of data. One of the approaches for automation involves extraction of graphical objects in the charts, e.g., pie segments, scatter points, etc., along with its semantics encoded in the textual content of the chart. The scatter plots and pie charts are amongst the widely used infographics for data analysis, and commonly have circle objects. Here, we propose a chart interpretation system, ACCirO (Analyzer of Charts with Circular Objects), that exploits the color and geometry of circular objects in scatter plots, its variants, and pie charts to extract the data from its images. ACCirO uses deep learning-based chart-type classification and OCR for text recognition to add semantics, and templatized sentence generation from the extracted data table for chart summarization. We show that image processing and deep learning approaches in ACCirO have improved the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {Contemporary machine learning literature highlights learning object-centric image representationsâ benefits, i.e. interpretability, and the improved generalization performance. In the current work, we develop a neural network architecture that effectively addresses the task of multi-object representation learning in scenes containing multiple objects of varying types and sizes. In particular, we combine SPAIR and SPACE ideas, which do not scale well to such complex images, and blend them with recent developments in single-shot object detection. The method overcomes the limitations of fixed-scale glimpsesâ processing by learning representations using a feature pyramid-based approach, allowing more feasible parallelization than all other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the method can focus on learning representations of only a selected subset of types of objects coexisting in scenes. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our architecture over SPAIR and SPACE, especially in terms of latent representation and inferring on images with objects of varying sizes.}

	abstract = {LEGO bricks are highly popular due to the ability to build almost any type of creation. This is possible thanks to availability of multiple shapes and colors of the bricks. For the smooth build process the bricks need to properly sorted and arranged. In our work we aim at creating an automated LEGO bricks sorter. With over 3700 different LEGO parts bricks classification has to be done with deep neural networks. The question arises which model of the available should we use? In this paper we try to answer this question. The paper presents a comparison of 28 models used for image classification trained to classify objects to high number of classes with potentially high level of similarity. For that purpose a dataset consisting of 447 classes was prepared. The paper presents brief description of analyzed models, the training and comparison process and discusses the results obtained. Finally the paper proposes an answer what network architecture should be used for the problem of LEGO bricks classification and other similar problems.}

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique, applied in clinical settings to measure arterial oxygen saturation. Using modern technology, PPG signals can be measured by wearable devices. This paper presents a novel procedure to study the dynamics of biomedical signals. The procedure uses features of a wavelet scattering transform to classify signal segments as either chaotic or non-chaotic. To this end, the paper also defines a chaos measure. Classification is made using a model trained on a dataset consisting of signals generated by systems with known characteristics. Using an example PPG signal, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of the wavelet scattering transform for the analysis of biomedical signals, and shows the importance of correctly preparing the training set.}

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are among the most commonly investigated models in computer vision. Deep CNNs yield high computational performance, but their common issue is a large size. For solving this problem, it is necessary to find effective compression methods which can effectively reduce the size of the network, keeping the accuracy on a similar level. This study provides important insights into the field of CNNs compression, introducing a novel low-rank compression method based on tensor-train decomposition on a permuted kernel weight tensor with automatic rank determination. The proposed method is easy to implement, and it allows us to fine-tune neural networks from decomposed factors instead of learning them from scratch. The results of this study examined on various CNN architectures and two datasets demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other CNNs compression methods with respect to parameter and FLOPS compression at a low drop in the classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims at introducing transparency and intelligibility into the decision-making process of AI systems. In recent years, most efforts were made to build XAI algorithms that are able to explain black-box models. However, in many cases, including medical and industrial applications, the explanation of a decision may be worth equally or even more than the decision itself. This imposes a question about the quality of explanations. In this work, we aim at investigating how the explanations derived from black-box models combined with XAI algorithms differ from those obtained from inherently interpretable glass-box models. We also aim at answering the question whether there are justified cases to use less accurate glass-box models instead of complex black-box approaches. We perform our study on publicly available datasets.}

	abstract = {Learning to operate medical equipment is one of the essential skills for providing efficient treatment to patients. One of the current problems faced by many medical institutions is the lack or shortage of specialized infrastructure for medical practitioners to conduct hands-on training. Medical equipment is mostly used for patients, limiting training time drastically. Virtual simulation can help alleviate this problem by providing the virtual embodiment of the medical facility in an affordable manner. This paper reports the current results of an ongoing project aimed at providing virtual reality-based technical training on various medical equipment to radiophysicist trainees. In particular, we introduce a virtual reality (VR) prototype of a linear accelerator simulator for oncological radiotherapy training. The paper discusses the main challenges and features of the VR prototype, including the system design and implementation. A key factor for traineesâ access and usability is the user interface, particularly tailored in our prototype to provide a powerful and versatile yet friendly user interaction.}

	abstract = {3D point clouds parameterization is a very important research topic in the fields of computer graphics and computer vision, which has many applications such as texturing, remeshing and morphing, etc. Different from mesh parameterization, point clouds parameterization is a more challenging task in general as there is normally no connectivity information between points. Due to this challenge, the papers on point clouds parameterization are not as many as those on mesh parameterization. To the best of our knowledge, there are no review papers about point clouds parameterization. In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods for parameterizing 3D point clouds. We start by introducing the applications and importance of point clouds parameterization before explaining some relevant concepts. According to the organization of the point clouds, we first divide point cloud parameterization methods into two groups: organized and unorganized ones. Since various methods for unorganized point cloud parameterization have been proposed, we further divide the group of unorganized point cloud parameterization methods into some subgroups based on the technique used for parameterization. The main ideas and properties of each method are discussed aiming to provide an overview of various methods and help with the selection of different methods for various applications.}

We find that the networks correctly predict the events and improve the statistics of the system with respect to the training data in almost all cases analysed.

	abstract = {Detecting outliers is a\xa0widely studied problem in many disciplines, including statistics, data mining and machine learning. All anomaly detection activities are aimed at identifying cases of unusual behavior when compared to the remaining set. There are many methods to deal with this issue, which are applicable depending on the size of the dataset, the way it is stored and the type of attributes and their values. Most of them focus on traditional datasets with a\xa0large number of quantitative attributes. While there are many solutions available for quantitative data, it remains problematic to find efficient methods for qualitative data. The main idea behind this article was to compare categorical data clustering algorithms: \\( \\textit{K-modes} \\) and ROCK. In the course of the research, the authors analyzed the clusters detected by the indicated algorithms, using several datasets different in terms of the number of objects and variables, and conducted experiments on the parameters of the algorithms. The presented study has made it possible to check whether the algorithms detect the same outliers in the data and how much they depend on individual parameters such as the number of variables, tuples and categories of a\xa0qualitative variable.}

	abstract = {Knowledge Graph (KG) completion aims to find the missing entities or relationships in a knowledge graph. Although many approaches have been proposed to construct complete KGs, graph embedding methods have recently gained massive attention. These methods performed well in transductive settings, where the entire collection of entities must be known during training. However, it is still unclear how effectively the embedding methods capture the relational semantics when new entities are added to KGs over time. This paper proposes a method, AGIL, for learning relational semantics in knowledge graphs to address this issue. Given a pair of nodes in a knowledge graph, our proposed method extracts a subgraph that contains common neighbors of the two nodes. The subgraph nodes are then labeled based on their distance from the two input nodes. Some heuristic features are computed and given along with the adjacency matrix of the subgraph as input to a graph neural network. The GNN predicts the likelihood of a relationship between the two nodes. We conducted experiments on five real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The AGIL in relation prediction outperforms the baselines both in the inductive and transductive setting.}

The computational resources and time required to generate these simulations can be so large and impractical. With several successes of generative models, we explore the performance and powerful generative capabilities of both generative adversarial network (GAN) and adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to predict the evolution in time of a highly nonlinear fluid flow. These generative models are incorporated within a reduced-order model framework. The test case comprises two-dimensional Gaussian vortices governed by the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation. We show that both the GAN and AAE are able to predict the evolution of the positions of the vortices forward in time, generating new samples that have never before been seen by the neural networks.}

	abstract = {We propose an approach for integrating social media data with physical data from satellites for the prediction of natural disasters. We show that this integration can improve accuracy in disaster management models, and propose a modular system for disaster instance and severity prediction using social media as a data source. The system is designed to be extensible to cover many disaster domains, social media platform streams, and machine learning methods. We additionally present a test case in the domain context of wildfires, using Twitter as a social data source and physical satellite data from the Global Fire Atlas. We show as a proof of concept for the system how this model can accurate predict wildfire attributes based on social media analysis, and also model social media sentiment dynamics over the course of the wildfire event. We outline how this system can be extended to cover wider disaster domains using different types of social media data as an input source, maximising the generalisability of the system.}
