	abstract = {Parallel three-dimensional (3D) cellular automaton models of tumor growth can efficiently model tumor morphology over many length and time scales. Here, we extended an existing two-dimensional (2D) model of tumor growth to study how tumor morphology could change over time and verified the 3D model with the initial 2D model on a per-slice level. However, increasing the dimensionality of the model imposes constraints on memory and time-to-solution that could quickly become intractable when simulating long temporal durations. Parallelizing such models would enable larger tumors to be investigated and also pave the way for coupling with treatment models. We parallelized the 3D growth model using N-body and lattice halo exchange schemes and further optimized the implementation to adaptively exchange information based on the state of cell expansion. We demonstrated a factor of 20x speedup compared to the serial model when running on 340 cores of Stampede2’s Knight’s Landing compute nodes. This proof-of-concept study highlighted that parallel 3D models could enable the exploration of large problem and parameter spaces at tractable run times.}

	abstract = {This paper examines potential applicability and efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in automatic music generation. Specifically, we propose an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) capable of constructing melodic line harmonization with given harmonic functions, based on the rules of music composing which are applied in the fitness function. It is expected that harmonizations constructed in accordance to these rules would be formally correct in terms of music theory and, additionally, would follow less-formalised aesthetic requirements and expectations. The fitness function is composed of several modules, with each module consisting of smaller parts. This design allows for its flexible modification and extension. The way the fitness function is constructed and tuned towards better quality harmonizations is discussed in the context of music theory and technical EA implementation. In particular, we show how could generated harmonizations be modelled by means of adjusting the relevance of particular fitness function components. The proposed method generates solutions which are technically correct (i.e. in line with music harmonization theory) and also “nice to listen to” (i.e. aesthetically plausible) as assessed by an expert - a harmony teacher.}

We examine the following four methods of the posterior probability estimation, where the risk of logistic loss function is optimized, namely: the naive approach, the weighted likelihood approach, as well as the quite recently proposed methods - the joint approach, and the LassoJoint method. The objective of our study is to evaluate the accuracy, the recall, the precision and the F1-score of the considered classification methods. The corresponding assessments have been carried out on 13 machine learning model schemes by conducting some numerical experiments on selected real datasets.}

	abstract = {The expansion of modern supply chains constantly triggers the need of maintaining resilience and agility for higher profit. There is a need to change the standard methods of inventory control to new approaches that are highly adaptable to uncertainties that emerged as a result of supply chains globalization. In this paper, a novel approach based on neural network, state-space control and robust optimization is proposed to support the perishable inventory replenishment decisions subject to uncertain lead times. We develop an approach based on the Wald criterion to compute optimal robust (i.e. “best of the worst” case) controller parameters. We incorporate lead-time specific perturbations through plausible scenarios using several lead times sets. Based on extensive numerical experiments, the obtained solutions highlight that the approach provides stable and robust solutions even for high lead times.}

	abstract = {QR factorization of dense matrices is a ubiquitous tool in high performance computing (HPC). From solving linear systems and least squares problems to eigenvalue problems, and singular value decompositions, the impact of a high performance QR factorization is fundamental to computer simulations and many applications. More importantly, the QR factorization on a batch of relatively small matrices has acquired a lot of attention in sparse direct solvers and low-rank approximations for Hierarchical matrices. To address this interest and demand, we developed and present a high performance batch QR factorization for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We present a multi-level blocking strategy that adjusts various algorithmic designs to the size of the input matrices. We also show that following the LAPACK QR design convention, while still useful, is significantly outperformed by unconventional code structures that increase data reuse. The performance results show multi-fold speedups against the state of the art libraries on the latest GPU architectures from both NVIDIA and AMD.}

	abstract = {Modeling of turbulent combustion system requires modeling the underlying chemistry and the turbulent flow. Solving both systems simultaneously is computationally prohibitive. Instead, given the difference in scales at which the two sub–systems evolve, the two sub–systems are typically (re)solved separately. Popular approaches such as the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) use a two–step strategy where the governing reaction kinetics are pre–computed and mapped to a low–dimensional manifold, characterized by a few reaction progress variables (model reduction) and the manifold is then “looked–up” during the run–time to estimate the high–dimensional system state by the flow system. While existing works have focused on these two steps independently, we show that joint learning of the progress variables and the look–up model, can yield more accurate results. We propose ChemTab an architecture that learns jointly and demonstrate its superiority.}

	abstract = {Simulations of the microvasculature can elucidate the effects of various blood flow parameters on micro-scale cellular and fluid phenomena. At this scale, the non-Newtonian behavior of blood requires the use of explicit cell models, which are necessary for capturing the full dynamics of cell motion and interactions. Over the last few decades, fluid-structure interaction models have emerged as a method to accurately capture the behavior of deformable cells in the blood. However, as computational power increases and systems with millions of red blood cells can be simulated, it is important to note that varying spatial distributions of cells may affect simulation outcomes. Since a single simulation may not represent the ensemble behavior, many different configurations may need to be sampled to adequately assess the entire collection of potential cell arrangements. In order to determine both the number of distributions needed and which ones to run, we must first establish methods to identify well-generated, randomly-placed cell distributions and to quantify distinct cell configurations. In this work, we utilize metrics to assess 1) the presence of any underlying structure to the initial cell distribution and 2) similarity between cell configurations. We propose the use of the radial distribution function to identify long-range structure in a cell configuration and apply it to a randomly-distributed and structured set of red blood cells. To quantify spatial similarity between two configurations, we make use of the Jaccard index, and characterize sets of red blood cell and sphere initializations.}

	abstract = {The paper introduces a novel coevolutionary approach (CoEvoSG) for solving Sequential Stackelberg Security Games. CoEvoSG maintains two competing populations of players’ strategies. In the process inspired by biological evolution both populations are developed simultaneously in order to approximate Stackelberg Equilibrium. The comprehensive experimental study based on over 500 test instances of two game types proved CoEvoSG’s ability to repetitively find optimal or close to optimal solutions. The main strength of the proposed method is its time scalability which is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms and allows to calculate bigger and more complicated games than ever before. Due to the generic and knowledge-free design of CoEvoSG, the method can be applied to diverse real-life security scenarios.}

	abstract = {We introduce Finch, a Julia-based domain specific language (DSL) for solving partial differential equations in a discretization agnostic way, currently including finite element and finite volume methods. A key focus is code generation for various internal or external software targets. Internal targets use a modular set of tools in Julia providing a direct solution within the framework. In contrast, external code generation produces a set of code files to be compiled and run with external libraries or frameworks. Examples include a matlab target, for smaller problems or prototyping, or C++/MPI based targets for larger problems needing scalability. This allows us to take advantage of their capabilities without needlessly duplicating them, and provides options tailored to the needs of the domain scientist. The modular design of Finch allows ongoing development of these target modules resulting in a more extensible framework and a broader set of applications. The support for multiple discretizations, including finite element and finite volume methods, also contributes to this goal. Another focus of this project is complex systems containing a large set of coupled PDEs that could be challenging to efficiently code and optimize by hand, but that are relatively simple to specify using the DSL. In this paper we present the key features of Finch that set it apart from many other DSL options, and demonstrate the basic usage and current capabilities through examples.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection for time series data is often aimed at identifying extreme behaviors within an individual time series. However, identifying extreme trends relative to a collection of other time series is of significant interest, like in the fields of public health policy, social justice and pandemic propagation. We propose an algorithm that can scale to large collections of time series data using the concepts from the theory of large deviations. Exploiting the ability of the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional data, we propose an online anomaly detection method to identify anomalies in a collection of multivariate time series. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Large Deviations Anomaly Detection (LAD) algorithm in identifying counties in the United States with anomalous trends in terms of COVID-19 related cases and deaths. Several of the identified anomalous counties correlate with counties with documented poor response to the COVID pandemic.\n}

	abstract = {B-spline models are a powerful way to represent scientific data sets with a functional approximation. However, these models can suffer from spurious oscillations when the data to be approximated are not uniformly distributed. Model regularization (i.e., smoothing) has traditionally been used to minimize these oscillations; unfortunately, it is sometimes impossible to sufficiently remove unwanted artifacts without smoothing away key features of the data set. In this article, we present a method of model regularization that preserves significant features of a data set while minimizing artificial oscillations. Our method varies the strength of a smoothing parameter throughout the domain automatically, removing artifacts in poorly-constrained regions while leaving other regions unchanged. The behavior of our method is validated on a collection of two- and three-dimensional data sets produced by scientific simulations.}

	abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based recommender systems have received increasing attention of researchers and demonstrate excellent results at solving various tasks in various areas. One of the last growing trends is learning the compatibility of items in a set and predicting the next item or several ones by input ones. Fashion compatibility modeling is one of the areas in which this task is being actively researched. Classical solutions are training on existing sets and are learning to recommend items that have been combined with each other before. This severely limits the number of possible combinations. GAN models proved to be the most effective for decreasing the impact of this problem and generating unseen combinations of items, but they also have several limitations. They use a fixed number of input and output items. However, real outfits contain a variable number of items. Also, they use unimodal or multimodal data to generate only visual features. However, this approach is not guaranteed to save content attributes of items during generation. We propose a multimodal transformer-based GAN with cross-modal attention to simultaneously explore visual features and textual attributes. We also propose to represent a set of items as a sequence of items to allow the model to decide how many items should be in the set. Experimenting on FOTOS dataset at the fill-in-the-blank task is showed that our method outperforms such strong baselines as Bi-LSTM-VSE, MGCM, HFGN, and others. Our model has reached 0.878 accuracy versus 0.724 of Bi-LSTM-VSE, 0.822 of MGCM, 0.826 of HFGN.\n}

	abstract = {Representation learning for graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we define and study a new problem of learning attributed graph embeddings. Our setting considers how to update existing node representations from structural graph embedding methods when some additional node attributes are given. To this end, we propose Graph Embedding RetroFitting (GERF), a method that delivers a compound node embedding that follows both the graph structure and attribute space similarity. Unlike other attributed graph embedding methods, GERF is a novel representation learning method that does not require recalculation of the embedding from scratch but rather uses existing ones and retrofits the embedding according to neighborhoods defined by the graph structure and the node attributes space. Moreover, our approach keeps the same embedding space all the time and allows comparing the positions of embedding vectors and quantifying the impact of attributes on the representation update. Our GERF method updates embedding vectors by optimizing the invariance loss, graph neighbor loss, and attribute the neighbor loss to obtain high-quality embeddings. Experiments on WikiCS, Amazon-CS, Amazon-Photo, and Coauthor-CS datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm receives similar results compared to other state-of-the-art attributed graph embedding models despite working in retrofitting manner.\n}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hierarchical ensemble method for improved imbalance classification. Specifically, we perform the first-level ensemble based on bootstrap sampling with replacement to create an ensemble. Then, the second-level ensemble is generated based on two different weighting strategies, where the strategy having better performance is selected for the subsequent analysis. Next, the third-level ensemble is obtained via the combination of two methods for obtaining mean and covariance of multivariate Gaussian distribution, where the oversampling is then realized via the fitted multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, different subsets are created by (1) the cluster that the current instance belongs to, and (2) the current instance and its k nearest minority neighbors. Furthermore, Euclidean distance-based sample optimization is developed for improved imbalance classification. Finally, late fusion based on majority voting is utilized to obtain final predictions. Experiment results on 15 KEEL datasets demonstrate the great effectiveness of our proposed method.\n}

The higher-order rational approximation of the propagation operator was taken as a basis. Computation of appropriate approximation coefficients and grid sizes is formulated as the problem of minimizing the discrete dispersion relation error. Keeping in mind the complexity of the developed optimization problem, the differential evolution method was used to tackle it. The proposed method does not require manual selection of the artificial parameters of the numerical scheme. The stability of the scheme is provided by an additional constraint of the optimization problem. A comparison with the Padé approximation method and rational interpolation is carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown.}

	abstract = {Finding a path in a narrow passage is a bottleneck for randomised sampling-based motion planning methods. This paper introduces a technique that solves this problem. The main inspiration was the method of exit areas for cavities in protein models, but the proposed solution can also be used in another context. For data with narrow passages, the proposed method finds passageways for which sampling-based methods are not sufficient, or provides information that a collision-free path does not exist. With such information, it is possible to quit the motion planning computation if no solution exists and its further search would be a loss of time. Otherwise, the method continues to sample the space with sampling-based method (a RRT algorithm) until a solution is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The method was tested on real biomolecular data - dcp protein - and on artificial data (to show the superiority of the proposed solution on better-imagined data) with positive results.}

	abstract = {The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model is well suited for executing irregular applications on cluster-based systems, due to its efficient support for short, one-sided messages. Separately, the actor model has been gaining popularity as a productive asynchronous message-passing approach for distributed objects in enterprise and cloud computing platforms, typically implemented in languages such as Erlang, Scala or Rust. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no past work on using the actor model to deliver both productivity and scalability to PGAS applications on clusters. In this paper, we introduce a new programming system for PGAS applications, in which point-to-point remote operations can be expressed as fine-grained asynchronous actor messages. In this approach, the programmer does not need to worry about programming complexities related to message aggregation and termination detection. Our approach can also be viewed as extending the classical Bulk Synchronous Parallelism model with fine-grained asynchronous communications within a phase or superstep. We believe that our approach offers a desirable point in the productivity-performance space for PGAS applications, with more scalable performance and higher productivity relative to past approaches. Specifically, for seven irregular mini-applications from the Bale benchmark suite executed using 2048 cores in the NERSC Cori system, our approach shows geometric mean performance improvements of \\({\\ge }20\\times \\) relative to standard PGAS versions (UPC and OpenSHMEM) while maintaining comparable productivity to those versions.}

	abstract = {Effective methods of the detection of multiword expressions are important for many technologies related to Natural Language Processing. Most contemporary methods are based on the sequence labeling scheme, while traditional methods use statistical measures. In our approach, we want to integrate the concepts of those two approaches. In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised multiword expressions extraction method which focuses on their behaviour in various contexts. Our method uses a lexicon of Polish multiword units as the reference knowledge base and leverages neural language modelling with deep learning architectures. In our approach, we do not need a corpus annotated specifically for the task. The only required components are: a lexicon of multiword units, a large corpus, and a general contextual embeddings model. Compared to the method based on non-contextual embeddings, we obtain gains of 15% points of the macro F1-score for both classes and 30% points of the F1-score for the incorrect multiword expressions. The proposed method can be quite easily applied to other languages.}

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks used in real-world recognition must be able to detect inputs that are Out-of-Distribution (OoD) with respect to the known or training data. A popular, simple method is to detect OoD inputs using confidence scores based on the Mahalanobis distance from known data. However, this procedure involves estimating the multivariate normal (MVN) density of high dimensional data using the insufficient number of observations (e.g., the dimensionality of features at the last two layers in the ResNet-101 model are 2048 and 1024, with ca. 1000–5000 examples per class for density estimation). In this work, we analyze the instability of parametric estimates of MVN density in high dimensionality and analyze the impact of this on the performance of Mahalanobis distance-based OoD detection. We show that this effect makes Mahalanobis distance-based methods ineffective for near OoD data. We show that the minimum distance from known data beyond which outliers are detectable depends on the dimensionality and number of training samples and decreases with the growing size of the training dataset. We also analyzed the performance of modifications of the Mahalanobis distance method used to minimize density fitting errors, such as using a common covariance matrix for all classes or diagonal covariance matrices. On OoD benchmarks (on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Noise datasets), using representations from the DenseNet or ResNet models, we show that none of these methods should be considered universally superior.}

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to recommendation systems involve using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques which make use of the similarities between users and items respectively. Such approaches evolved to encapsulate model-based latent factor (LF) algorithms that use matrix decomposition to ingest a user-item matrix of ratings to generate recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on 3D LF model and tensor decomposition method for devising personalized recommendations driven from additional contextual features. We also present our stacking method for a tensor generation prior to incorporating LF models. We validate our proposed personalized recommender using two real-world datasets. Our experimental results showed that additional contextual features can help to personalize recommendations while maintaining similar or better performance compared to conventional 2D LF methods. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of the quality of the contextual features to be used in 3D LF models. In addition, our experiments show the effective performance of our new stacking method on computation time and accuracy of the proposed recommender.}

The governing equations consists of the linear elasticity in the bed topography coupled to the shallow water hydro-sediment-morphodynamic equations. Transfer conditions at the bed interface between the water surface and the bedload are also developed using frictional forces and hydrostatic pressures. A hybrid finite volume/finite element method is implemented for the numerical solution of the proposed model. Well-balanced discretization of the gradient fluxes and source terms is formulated for the finite volume and the treatment of dry areas in the model is discussed in the present study. The finite element method uses quadratic elements on unstructured meshes and interfacial forces are samples on the common nodes for finite volume and finite element grids. Numerical results are presented for a dam-break problem in hydro-sediment-morphodynamic models and the computed solutions demonstrated the ability of the proposed model in accurately capturing the stress distributions for erosional and depositional deformations. In addition, the coupled model is accurate, very efficient, well-balanced and it can solve complex geometries.}

	abstract = {Designing efficient steel solidification methods could contribute to a sustainable future manufacturing. Current computational models, including physics-based and machine learning-based design, have not led to a robust solidification design. Predicting phase-change interface is the crucial step for steel solidification design. In the present work, we propose a simplified model for thermal radiation to be included in the phase-change equations. The proposed model forms a set of nonlinear partial differential equations and it accounts for both thermal radiation and phase change in the design. As numerical solver we implement a fully implicit time integration scheme and a Newton-type algorithm is used to deal with the nonlinear terms. Computational results are presented for two test examples of steel solidification. The findings here could be used to understand effect of thermal radiation in steel solidification. Combining the present approach with physics-based computer modeling can provide a potent tool for steel solidification design.}

	abstract = {High Content Screening (HCS) allows for a complex cell analysis by  combining fluorescent microscopy with the capability to automatically create a large number of images. Example of such cell analysis is examination of cell morphology under influence of a compound. Nevertheless, classical approaches bring the need for manual labeling of cell examples in order to train a machine learning model. Such methods are time- and resource-consuming. To accelerate the analysis of HCS data, we propose a new self-supervised model for cell classification: Self-Supervised Multiple Instance Learning (SSMIL). Our model merges Contrastive Learning with Multiple Instance Learning to analyze images with weak labels. We test SSMIL using our own dataset of microglia cells that present different morphology due to compound-induced inflammation. Representation provided by our model obtains results comparable to supervised methods proving feasibility of the method and opening the path for future experiments using both HCS and other types of medical images.}

	abstract = {Self-supervised methods gain popularity by achieving results on par with supervised methods using fewer labels. However, their explaining techniques ignore the general semantic concepts present in the picture, limiting to local features at a pixel level. An exception is the visual probing framework that analyzes the vision concepts of an image using probing tasks. However, it does not explain if analyzed concepts are critical for target task performance. This work fills this gap by introducing amnesic visual probing that removes information about particular visual concepts from image representations and measures how it affects the target task accuracy. Moreover, it applies Marr’s computational theory of vision to examine the biases in visual representations. As a result of experiments and user studies conducted for multiple self-supervised methods, we conclude, among others, that removing information about 3D forms from the representation decrease classification accuracy much more significantly than removing textures.}

	abstract = {The emergence of information theft poses  a serious threat to mobile users. Short message service (SMS), as a mainstream communication medium, is usually used by attackers to implement propagation, command and control. The previous detection works are based on the local perspective of terminals, and it is difficult to find all the victims and covert attackers for a theft event. In order to address this problem, we propose DITA-NCG, a method that globally detects information theft attacks based on node communication graph (NCG). The communication behavior of a NCG’s node is expressed by both call detail record (CDR) vectors and network flow vectors. Firstly, we use CDR vectors to implement social subgraph division and find suspicious subgraphs with SMS information entropy. Secondly, we use network flow vectors to distinguish information theft attack graphs from suspicious subgraphs, which help us to identify information theft attack. Finally, we evaluate DITA-NCG by using real world network flows and CDRs , and the result shows that DITA-NCG can effectively and globally detect information theft attack in mobile network.}

	abstract = {Time series forecasting is a challenging problem particularly when a time series expresses multiple seasonality, nonlinear trend and varying variance. In this work, to forecast complex time series, we propose ensemble learning which is based on randomized neural networks, and boosted in three ways. These comprise ensemble learning based on residuals, corrected targets and opposed response. The latter two methods are employed to ensure similar forecasting tasks are solved by all ensemble members, which justifies the use of exactly the same base models at all stages of ensembling. Unification of the tasks for all members simplifies ensemble learning and leads to increased forecasting accuracy. This was confirmed in an experimental study involving forecasting time series with triple seasonality, in which we compare our three variants of ensemble boosting. The strong points of the proposed ensembles based on RandNNs are very rapid training and pattern-based time series representation, which extracts relevant information from time series.}

	abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) presents a risk of transformation to malignant intraductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. Three tumor suppressor genes RB, BRCA1 and TP53 are critical in curtailing the progress of DCIS to IDC. The complex transition process from DCIS to IDC involves acquisition of intracellular genomic aberrations and consequent changes in phenotypic characteristics and protein expression level of the cells. The spatiotemporal dynamics associated with breech of epithelial basement membrane and subsequent invasion of stromal tissues during the transition is less understood. We explore the emergence of invasive behavior in benign tumors, emanating from altered expression levels of the three critical genes. A multiscale mechanistic model based on Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg method-based modelling (GGH) is used to unravel the phenotypical and biophysical dynamics promoting the invasive nature of DCIS. Ductal morphologies including comedo, hyperplasia and DCIS, evolve spontaneously from the interplay between the gene activity parameters in the simulations. The spatiotemporal model elucidates the cause-and-effect relationship between cell-level biological signaling and tissue-level biophysical response in the ductal microenvironment. The model predicts that BRCA1 mutations will act as a facilitator for DCIS to IDC transitions while mutations in RB act as initiator of such transitions.}

	abstract = {The PageRank algorithm is a  widely used linear algebra method with many applications. As graphs with billions or more of nodes become increasingly common, being able to scale this algorithm on modern HPC architectures is of prime importance. While most existing approaches have explored distributed computing to compute an approximation of the PageRank scores, we focus on the numerical computation using the power iteration method. We develop and implement a distributed parallel version of the PageRank. This application is deployed on the supercomputer Fugaku, using up to one thousand compute nodes to assess scalability on random stochastic matrices. These large-scale experiments show that the network-on-chip of the A64FX processor acts as an additional level of computation, in between nodes and cores.}

	abstract = {Technological advancements in modern scientific instruments, such as  scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), have significantly increased data acquisition rates and image resolutions enabling new questions to be explored; however, the resulting data volumes and velocities, combined with automated experiments, are quickly overwhelming scientists as there remain crucial steps that require human intervention, for example reviewing image focus. We present a fast out-of-focus detection algorithm for electron microscopy images collected serially and demonstrate that it can be used to provide near-real-time quality control for neuroscience workflows. Our technique, Multi-scale Histologic Feature Detection, adapts classical computer vision techniques and is based on detecting various fine-grained histologic features. We exploit the inherent parallelism in the technique to employ GPU primitives in order to accelerate characterization. We show that our method can detect out-of-focus conditions within just 20\xa0ms. To make these capabilities generally available, we deploy our feature detector as an on-demand service and show that it can be used to determine the degree of focus in approximately 230\xa0ms, enabling near-real-time use.}

	abstract = {The increasing volume and variety of science data has led to the creation of metadata extraction systems that automatically derive and synthesize relevant information from files. A critical component of metadata extraction systems is a mechanism for mapping extractors—lightweight tools to mine information from a particular file types—to each file in a repository. However, existing methods do little to address the heterogeneity and scale of science data, thereby leaving valuable data unextracted or wasting significant compute resources applying incorrect extractors to data. We construct an extractor scheduler that leverages file type identification (FTI) methods. We show that by training lightweight multi-label, multi-class statistical models on byte samples from files, we can correctly map 35% more extractors to files than by using libmagic. Further, we introduce a metadata quality toolkit to automatically assess the utility of extracted metadata.}

	abstract = {Single packet attack, which is initiated by adding attack information to traffic packets, pose a great threat to cybersecurity. Existing detection methods for single packet attack just learn features directly from single packet but ignore the hierarchical relationship of packet resources, which trends to high false positive rate and poor generalization. In this paper, We conduct an extensive measurement study of the realistic traffic and find that the hierarchical relationship of resources is suitable for identifying single packet attacks. Therefore, we propose HNOP, a deep neural network model equipped with the hierarchical relationship, to detect single packet attacks from raw HTTP packets. Firstly, we construct resource node hopping structure based on the “Referer” field and the “URL” field in HTTP packets. Secondly, hopping features are extracted from the hopping structure of the resource nodes by G_BERT, which are further combined with the lexical features extracted by convolution operation from each node of the structure to form feature vectors. Finally, the extracted features are fed to a classifier, mapping the extracted features to the classification space through a fully connected network, to detect attack traffic. Experiments on the publicly available dataset CICIDS-2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of HNOP with an accuracy of 99.92% and a false positive rate of 0.12%. Furthermore, we perform extensive experiments on dataset IIE_HTTP collected from important service targets at different time. At last, it is verified that the HNOP has the least degraded performance and better generalization compared to the other models.}

	abstract = {We present an algorithm to perform trust-region-based optimization for nonlinear unconstrained problems. The method selectively uses function and gradient evaluations at different floating-point precisions to reduce the overall energy consumption, storage, and communication costs; these capabilities are increasingly important in the era of exascale computing. In particular, we are motivated by a desire to improve computational efficiency for massive climate models. We employ our method on two examples: the CUTEst test set and a large-scale data assimilation problem to recover wind fields from radar returns. Although this paper is primarily a proof of concept, we show that if implemented on appropriate hardware, the use of mixed-precision can significantly reduce the computational load compared with fixed-precision solvers.}

	abstract = {The need to analyze information from streams arises in a variety of applications. One of its fundamental research directions is to mine sequential patterns over data streams. Current studies mine series of items based on the presence of the pattern in transactions but pay no attention to the series of itemsets and their multiple occurrences. The pattern over a window of itemsets stream and their multiple occurrences, however, provides additional capability to recognize the essential characteristics of the patterns and the inter-relationships among them that are unidentifiable by the existing presence-based studies. In this paper, we study such a new sequential pattern mining problem and propose a corresponding sequential miner with novel strategies to prune the search space efficiently. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show the utility of our approach.\n}

	abstract = {Event extraction is a key task of information extraction. Existing methods are not effective due to two challenges of this task: 1) Most of previous methods only consider a single granularity information and they are often insufficient to distinguish ambiguity of triggers for some types of events. 2) The correlation among intra-sentence and inter-sentence event is non-trivial to model. Previous methods are weak in modeling interdependency among the correlated events and they have never modeled this problem for the whole event extraction task. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-granularity Heterogeneous Graph-based event extraction model (MHGEE) to solve the two problems simultaneously. For the first challenge, MHGEE constructs multi-granularity nodes, including word, entity and context and captures interactions among nodes by R-GCN. It can strengthen semantic and distinguish ambiguity of triggers. For the second, MHGEE uses heterogeneous graph neural network to aggregating the information of relevant events and hence capture the interdependency among the events. The experiment results on ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate that our proposed MHGEE model achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in event extraction. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in ambiguity of triggers and event interdependency.}

	abstract = {For appropriate workloads, partially ordered message delivery can greatly reduce message latency. For example, updates to screens (e.g., remote desktops, VNC) may not have to be totally ordered with respect to different regions of the screen, but ordered with respect to updates to the same region. Similarly, updates to disjoint regions of a file (e.g., bulk-data transfer of sensor data) can be applied in any order, as long as updates (or reads) to the same region of the file are ordered in a consistent way, per data consistency models. Therefore, we introduce the concept of a consistency fence (CF), inspired by a memory fence from data consistency models, as a mechanism to control, specify, and reason about partial orders. If messages are lost on a network, partial ordering via CFs provides a framework to tolerate the latency associated with retransmission, for key workloads. In a set of simple experiments, based on screen update workloads, we show the latency benefits of partial ordering with CFs. We also show how forward error-correction (FEC) can be combined with CFs and partial ordering to reduce cumulative latency (represented as a cumulative distribution function), as compared to total ordering of messages.}

The method adopts incremental learning to perform client segmentation based on their predictability profiles and can be used by banks not only for determining predictable (and thus profitable, in a sense) clients currently but also for analyzing their dynamics during economical periods of different types. Our experiments show that (1) bank clients can be effectively divided into predictability classes dynamically, (2) the quality of prediction and classification models is significantly higher with the proposed incremental approach than without it, (3) clients have different transactional behavior in terms of predictability before and during the COVID-19 pandemics.}

	abstract = {The boron-nitrogen (B-N) co-doped diamond with different structures have been studied by the first-principle calculations to find possible defect structures to achieve effective n-type doping. Nitrogen doped diamond itself shows the characteristics of direct bandgap, however its big gap between donor level and conduction band minimum (CBM) may contribute to its undesirable ionization energy. We found for the first time B-N co-doping as a promising method to overcome the disadvantages of N doping in diamond. B-N co-doped diamond, especially the B-N3 defect, retains the characteristics of direct band gap, and has the advantages of low ionization energy and low formation energy. The effective mass of electron/ hole of B-N co-doped diamond is less than that of pure diamond, indicating better conductivity in diamond. The N-2p states play vital role in the conduction band edge of B-N3 co-doped diamond. Hence, the B-N3 has outstanding performance and is expected to become a promising option for N-type doping in diamond.}

	abstract = {The stock market is a complex network that consists of individual stocks exhibiting various financial properties and different data distribution. For stock prediction, it is natural to build separate models for each stock but also consider the complex hidden correlation among a set of stocks. We propose a federated multi-task stock predictor with financial graph Laplacian regularization (FMSP-FGL). Specifically, we first introduce a federated multi-task framework with graph Laplacian regularization to fit separate but related stock predictors simultaneously. Then, we investigate the problem of graph Laplacian learning, which represents the association of the dynamic stock. We show that the proposed optimization problem with financial Laplacian constraints captures both the inter-series correlation between each pair of stocks and the relationship within the same stock cluster, which helps improve the predictive performance. Empirical results on two popular stock indexes demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the advantage of graph Laplacian in multi-task learning for financial data to predict multiple stocks in parallel.}

However, it has also manifested itself a wide shield for various illegal hidden services involved cyber criminals, motivating the urgent need of deanonymization technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel communication fingerprint abstracted from key packet sequences, and attempt to efficiently identify end users MEEK-based access to Tor hidden services. Specifically, we investigate the communication fingerprint during the early connection stage of MEEK-based Tor rendezvous establishment, and make use of deep neural network to automatically learn and form a key packet sequence. Unlike most of existing approaches that rely on the entire long communication packet sequence, experiments demonstrate that our key packet sequence enabled scheme can significantly reduce both the time and hardware resource consumption for the identification task by 23%–37% and 80%–86%, respectively, while being able to keep a slightly better accuracy.}

	abstract = {Cyberbullying is an aggressive and intentional behavior committed by groups or individuals, and its main manifestation is to make offensive or hurtful comments on social media. The existing researches on cyberbullying detection underuse natural language processing technology, and is only limited to extracting the features of comment content. Meanwhile, the existing datasets for cyberbullying detection are non-standard, unbalanced, and the data content of datasets is relatively outdated. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid deep Model based on Multi-feature Fusion (HMMF), which can model the content of news comments and the side information related to net users and comments simultaneously, to improve the performance of cyberbullying detection. In addition, we present the JRTT: a new, publicly available benchmark dataset for cyberbullying detection. All the data are collected from social media platforms which contains Chinese comments on COVID-19 news. To evaluate the effectiveness of HMMF, we conduct extensive experiments on JRTT dataset with five existing pre-trained language models. Experimental results and analyses show that HMMF achieves state-of-the-art performances on cyberbullying detection. To facilitate research in this direction, we release the dataset and the project code at https://github.com/xingjian215/HMMF.}

	abstract = {This paper presents research on one of the most challenging branches of music information retrieval – musical instruments identification. Millions of songs are available online, so recognizing instruments and tagging them by a human being is nearly impossible. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods that can automatically assign the instrument to the given sound sample. Unfortunately, the number of well-prepared datasets for training such algorithms is very limited. Here, a series of experiments have been carried out to examine how the mentioned methods’ training data should be composed. The tests were focused on assessing the decision confidence, the impact of sound characteristics (different dynamics and articulation), the influence of training data volume, and the impact of data type (real instruments and digitally created sound samples). The outcomes of the tests described in the paper can help make new training datasets and boost research on accurate classifying instruments that are audible in the given recordings.}

	abstract = {QUIC-Fire is a modern fire simulation tool that can simulate the progression of three-dimensional fuel consumption over a landscape, modeling the interaction of a wildfire with weather such as wind conditions around the wildfire. The resulting simulation gives a detailed progression of the consumed three-dimensional fuel that can be eloquently mapped to an image of a burn area in the landscape as the wildfire progresses over time. Although an image of burned vegetation over a landscape gives detailed information of the activity and coverage area of a wildfire, a numerical characterization of the boundary of the burn area can be used for a variety of computations. The boundary of the burn area, also labeled as the wildfire perimeter, can be parametrized with a closed polygon. The set of ordered vertices of the closed polygon provide a compact numerical representation of the location of the wildfire and can be used for computations related to fire coverage area and modern wildfire assimilation techniques to improve the prediction of wildfire progression. Designing a robust algorithm to create a wildfire perimeter in the form of a set of ordered vertices of a closed polygon around the image of consumed vegetation in a landscape is not a trivial task. This paper discusses the properties of two such algorithms: the iterative minimum distance algorithm (IMDA) and quadriculation algorithm (QA) to obtain a closed polygon for a wildfire perimeter. To illustrate the effectiveness, these two algorithms are applied to multiple image (raster) data of a burn area in the landscape of a wildfire created by QUIC-Fire simulations. It is shown that both algorithms are robust in computing wildfire perimeters, and computational time are less than one second for each image created by QUIC-Fire. As such, this work contributes to the development of computational methods to automate the process of characterizing the closed polygon of a wildfire perimeter based on burn area images.}

	abstract = {The root-finding problem is very important in many applications and has become an extensive research field. One of the directions in this field is the use of various iteration schemes. In this paper, we propose a new generalised iteration scheme. The schemes like Mann, Ishikawa, Das–Debata schemes are special cases of the proposed iteration. Moreover, we use the proposed iteration with the PSO-based Newton-like method in two tasks. In the first task, we search for the roots, whereas in the second one for patterns with aesthetic features. The obtained results show that the proposed iteration can decrease the average number of iterations needed to find the roots and that we can generate patterns with potential artistic applications.}

	abstract = {The term ‘privacy paradox’ refers to the apparent inconsistency between people’s concerns about their privacy and their actual privacy behaviour. Although several possible explanations for this phenomenon have been provided so far, these assume that (1) all people share the same privacy concerns and (2) a snapshot at a given point in time is enough to explain the phenomenon. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a system dynamics simulation model that considers the diversity of privacy concerns during the process of social media adoption and identifies the types of situations in which the privacy paradox emerges. The results show that (1) the least concerned minority can induce the more concerned majority to adopt social media and (2) even the most concerned minority can be hindered by the less concerned majority from discarding social media. Both (1) and (2) are types of situations that reflect the privacy paradox.}

Using GPU power capping we found other than default configurations minimizing three various metrics: energy (E), energy-delay product (EDP) as well as energy-delay sum (EDS) which resulted in considerable energy savings, with a low to medium performance loss for EDP and EDS. Specifically, for Quadro\xa06000 and minimization of E we obtained energy savings of 28.5%–32.5%, for EDP 25%–28% of energy was saved with average 4.5%–15.4% performance loss, for EDS (k\xa0=\xa02) 22%–27% of energy was saved with 4.5%–13.8% performance loss. For V100 we found average energy savings of 24%–33%, for EDP energy savings of 23%–27% with corresponding performance loss of 13%–21% and for EDS (k\xa0=\xa02) 23.5%–27.3% of energy was saved with performance loss of 4.5%–13.8%.}

	abstract = {This paper examines whether the probability of default (Merton 1974) can be applied to banks’ default predictions. Using the case of US banks in the post-crisis period (2010–2014), we estimate several Cox proportional hazard models as well as their out-of-sample performance. As a result, we find that the Merton measure, that is, the probability of default, is not a sufficient statistic for predicting bank default, while, with the 6-month forecasting horizon, it is an extremely significant predictor and its functional form is a useful construct for predicting bank default. Findings suggest that (i) predicting banks’ defaults over a mid- to long-term horizon can be done more effectively by adding the inverse of equity volatility and the value of net income over total assets, and (ii) the role of the capital adequacy ratio is doubtful even in short-run default prediction.}

In technical systems, the face contains a number of important information that enables the identification of a person. The COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to cover the face with a mask and thus hide a significant part of information content in the face, important for social or technical purposes. The paper analyses how covering the face with a mask makes it difficult to identify a person in terms of age and gender determination. Analyzes with the employment of state of the art models based on deep neural networks are performed. Their effectiveness is investigated in the context of the limited information available, as with the case of the face covered with a mask.}

	abstract = {Finding the smallest enclosing circle of the given points in \\(E^2\\) is a seemingly simple problem. However, already proposed algorithms have high memory requirements or require special solutions due to the great recursion depth or high computational complexity unacceptable for large data sets, etc. This paper presents a simple and efficient method with speed-up over 100 times based on processed data reduction. It is based on efficient preprocessing, which significantly reduces points used in the final processing. It also significantly reduces the depth of recursion and memory requirements, which is a limiting factor for large data processing. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement and it is extensible to the \\(E^3\\) case, too. The proposed algorithm was tested for up to \\(10^9\\) of points using the Halton’s and “Salt and Pepper” distributions.}

	abstract = {With the development of distributed stream processing systems, elastic resource allocation has become a powerful means to deal with the fluctuating data stream. The existing methods either focus on a single operator or only consider the static correlation between operators to perform elastic scaling. However, they ignore the dynamic correlation between operators in data stream processing applications, which leads to lagging and inaccuracy resource allocation, increasing processing latency. To address these issues, we propose an elastic resource allocation method, which is based on the dynamic perception of operator influence domain, to perform resource allocation dynamically and in advance. The experimental results show that compared with the existing methods, our method not only guarantees that the end-to-end latency meets QoS requirements but also reduces resource utilization.}

	abstract = {Rapid progress in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increased attention to the potential vulnerability and reliability of AI technologies. To counter this issue a multitude of methods has been proposed. Most of them rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs), which highlight the most important areas in the analyzed image according to the given model. In this paper we propose another look into the problem. Instead of detecting salient areas we aim to identify features that were recognized by the model and compare this insight with other images. Thus giving us information: which parts of the picture were common, which were unique for a given class. Proposed method has been implemented using PyTorch and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/szandala/TorchPRISM.}

	abstract = {Data-flow computing is a natural and convenient paradigm for expressing parallelism. This is particularly true for tools that automatically extract the data dependencies among the tasks while allowing to exploit both distributed and shared memory parallelism. This is the case of UPC++ DepSpawn, a new task-based library developed on UPC++ (Unified Parallel C++), a library for parallel computing on a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) environment, and the well-known Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks) library for multithreading. In this paper we present and evaluate the evolution of this library after changing its engine for shared memory parallelism and adapting it to the newest version of UPC++, which differs very strongly from the original version on which UPC++ DepSpawn was developed. As we will see, while keeping the same high level of programmability, the new version is on average 9.3% faster than the old one, the maximum speedup being 66.3%.}
