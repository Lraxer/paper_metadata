	abstract = {In this study, we delve into the realm of meta-learning to combine point base forecasts for probabilistic short-term electricity demand forecasting. Our approach encompasses the utilization of quantile linear regression, quantile regression forest, and post-processing techniques involving residual simulation to generate quantile forecasts. Furthermore, we introduce both global and local variants of meta-learning. In the local-learning mode, the meta-model is trained using patterns most similar to the query pattern. Through extensive experimental studies across 35 forecasting scenarios and employing 16 base forecasting models, our findings underscored the superiority of quantile regression forest over its competitors.}

	abstract = {We analyze 7826 publications from the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) between 2001 and 2023 using natural language processing and network analysis. We categorize computer science into 13 main disciplines and 102 sub-disciplines sourced from Wikipedia. After lemmatizing full texts of these papers, we calculate the similarity scores between the papers and each sub-discipline using vectors built with TF-IDF evaluation. Among the 13 main disciplines, machine learning & AI have become the most popular topics since 2019, surpassing parallel & distributed computing, which peaked in the early 2010\xa0s. Modeling & simulation, and algorithms & data structure have always been popular disciplines in ICCS over the past 23\xa0years. The most frequently researched sub-disciplines, on average, are algorithms, numerical analysis, and machine learning. Deep learning shows the most rapid growth, while parallel computing has declined over the past 23\xa0years in ICCS publications. The network of sub-disciplines exhibits a scale-free distribution, indicating certain disciplines are more connected than others. We also present correlation analysis of sub-disciplines, both within the same main disciplines and between different main disciplines.}

	abstract = {Stance detection, i.e. recognition of utterances in favor, against or neutral in relation to some targets is important for text analysis. However, different approaches were tested on different datasets, often interpreted in different ways. We propose a unified overview of the state-of-the-art stance detection methods in which targets are expressed by short phrases. Special attention is given to zero-shot learning settings. An overview of the available multiple target datasets is presented that reveals several problems with the sets and their proper interpretation. Wherever possible, methods were re-run or even re-implemented to facilitate reliable comparison. A novel modification of a prompt-based approach to training encoder transformers for stance detection is proposed. It showed comparable results to those obtained with large language models, but at the cost of an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Our work tries to reliably show where do we stand in stance detection and where should we go, especially in terms of datasets and experimental settings.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of various modifications introduced to current state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures specifically designed for the steganalysis of digital images. Usage of deep learning methods has consistently demonstrated improved results in this field over the past few years, primarily due to the development of newer architectures with higher classification accuracy compared to their predecessors. Despite the advances made, further improvements are desired to achieve even better performance in this field. The conducted experiments provide insights into how each modification affects the classification accuracy of the architectures, which is a measure of their ability to distinguish between stego and cover images. Based on the obtained results, potential enhancements are identified that future CNN designs could adopt to achieve higher accuracy while minimizing their complexity compared to current architectures. The impact of modifications on each model’s performance has been found to vary depending on the tested architecture and the steganography embedding method used.}

	abstract = {This is a follow-up study on Zernike moments applicable in detection tasks owing to a construction of complex-valued integral images that we have proposed in [3]. The main goal of the proposition was to calculate the mentioned features fast (in constant-time). The proposed solution can be applied with success when dealing with single images, however it is still too slow to be used in real-time applications, for example in video processing. In this work we attempted to solve mentioned problem. In this paper we propose a technique in order to reduce the detection time in real-time applications. The degree of reduction is controlled by two parameters: fs (related to the gap between frames that undergo a full scan) and nb (related to the size of neighborhood to be searched on non-fully scanned frames). We present a series of experiments to show how our solution performs in terms of both detection time and accuracy.}

	abstract = {Subatomic particle track reconstruction (tracking) is a vital task in High-Energy Physics experiments. Tracking is exceptionally computationally challenging and fielded solutions, relying on traditional algorithms, do not scale linearly. Machine Learning (ML) assisted solutions are a promising answer. We argue that a complexity-reduced problem description and the data representing it, will facilitate the solution exploration workflow. We provide the REDuced VIrtual Detector (REDVID) as a complexity-reduced detector model and particle collision event simulator combo. REDVID is intended as a simulation-in-the-loop, to both generate synthetic data efficiently and to simplify the challenge of ML model design. The fully parametric nature of our tool, with regards to system-level configuration, while in contrast to physics-accurate simulations, allows for the generation of simplified data for research and education, at different levels. Resulting from the reduced complexity, we showcase the computational efficiency of REDVID by providing the computational cost figures for a multitude of simulation benchmarks. As a simulation and a generative tool for ML-assisted solution design, REDVID is highly flexible, reusable and open-source. Reference data sets generated with REDVID are publicly available. Data generated using REDVID has enabled rapid development of multiple novel ML model designs, which is currently ongoing.\n}

	abstract = {Recently proposed methods for reconstructing 3D objects use a mesh with an atlas consisting of planar patches that approximate the object’s surface. However, in real-world scenarios, the surfaces of reconstructed objects exhibit discontinuities that degrade the mesh’s quality. Therefore, conducting additional research on methods to overcome discontinuities and improve mesh quality is always advantageous. This paper proposes to address the limitation by maintaining local consistency around patch vertices. We present LoCondA, a Locally Conditioned Atlas that represents a 3D object hierarchically as a generative model. The model initially maps the point cloud of an object onto a sphere and subsequently enforces the mapping to be locally consistent on both the sphere and the target object through the use of a spherical prior. Using this method, the mesh can be sampled on the sphere and then projected back onto the manifold of the object, yielding diverse topologies that can be seamlessly connected. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach produces structurally coherent reconstructions with meshes of comparable quality to those of competitors.\n}

Utilizing I/O (Input/Output) libraries, such as HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format) and ADIOS2 (Adaptable IO System), facilitates the filtering of raw data, with prior research highlighting the advantages of dissecting these formats for enhanced metadata management. Our study introduces a novel data management technique aimed at boosting query performance for HPC analysis applications through the automatic precomputation of commonly used data characteristics, as identified by our user survey. The Data Analysis Interface (DAI), developed for the JULEA storage framework, not only enables querying this enriched metadata but also shows how domain-specific features can be integrated, demonstrating a potential improvement in query times by up to 22,000 times.}

	abstract = {Designing deep learning architectures is a challenging and time-consuming task. To address this problem, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which automatically searches for a network topology is used. While existing NAS methods mainly focus on image classification tasks, particularly 2D medical images, this study presents an evolutionary NAS approach for 2D and 3D Medical image classification. We defined two different search spaces for 2D and 3D datasets and performed a comparative study of different meta-heuristics used in different NAS studies. Moreover, zero-cost proxies have been used to evaluate the performance of deep neural networks, which helps reduce the searching cost of the overall approach. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of Data Augmentation (DA) in model generalization, we propose a genetic algorithm based automatic DA strategy to find the optimal DA policy. Experiments on MedMNIST benchmark and BreakHIS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing competitive results compared to existing AutoML approaches. The source code of our proposed approach is available at https://github.com/Junaid199f/evo_nas_med_2d_3d.}

	abstract = {The paper presents the interval fast parametric integral equations system (IFPIES) applied to solve multi-connected boundary value problems (BVPs) with uncertainly defined complex shapes of a boundary. The method is similar to the fast PIES, which uses the fast multipole method to speed up solving BVPs and reduce RAM utilization. However, modelling uncertainty in the IFPIES uses interval numbers and directed interval arithmetic. Segments created the boundary have the form of the interval Bézier curves of the third degree (curvilinear segments) or the first degree (linear segment). The curves also required some modifications connected with applied directed interval arithmetic. In the presented paper, the reliability and efficiency of the IFPIES solutions were verified on multi-connected BVPs with uncertainly defined complex linear and curvilinear domain shapes. The solutions were compared with the ones obtained by the interval PIES only due to the lack of examples of solving uncertainly defined BVPs in the literature. All presented tests confirm the high efficiency of the IFPIES method.\n}

	abstract = {Temporal expression extraction (TEE) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enabling the capture of temporal information for downstream tasks such as logical reasoning and information retrieval. However, current TEE research mainly focuses on resource-rich languages like English, leaving a gap for minor languages (e.g. Uyghur) in research. To address these issues, we create an English-Uyghur cross-lingual dataset specifically for the task of temporal expression extraction in Uyghur. Besides, considering the unique characteristics of Uyghur, we propose XLTU, a Cross-Lingual model in Temporal expression extraction for Uyghur, and utilize multi-task learning to help transfer the knowledge from English to Uyghur. We compare XLTU with different models on our dataset, and the results demonstrate that our model XLTU achieves the SOTA results on various evaluation metrics. We make our code and dataset publicly available (https://github.com/lyfcsdo2011/XLTU).\n}

	abstract = {Music is a ubiquitous phenomenon. In today’s world, no one can imagine life without its presence, and no one questions its significance in human life. This is not a new phenomenon but has been prevalent for hundreds of years. Therefore, an automated approach to understanding music plays a nontrivial role in science. One of the many tasks in Music Information Retrieval is the categorization of musical compositions. In this paper, the authors address the rarely explored topic of classifying traditional musical compositions from different cultures into regions (continents), subregions, and countries. A newly created dataset is presented, along with preliminary classification results using well-known classifiers. The presented work marks the beginning of a long and fascinating scientific journey.\n}

	abstract = {Moving toward a sustainable society requires the development of reliable indices, indicators, and computational methods that supply the tools, such as decision support systems used in assessing the achievement of sustainable development goals. The aim of this paper is to present an intelligent decision support system that enables multi-criteria evaluation, taking into account the temporal variability of the performance of the assessed alternatives. The framework of this DSS is based on the method called Data vARIability Assessment - Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (DARIA-MARCOS). The proposed method was used for an exemplary multi-criteria analysis problem concerning the implementation of the sustainable development goals included in Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), focused on sustainable cities and communities. SDG 11 aims to develop toward making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The methodical framework implemented in the demonstrated DSS ensures an efficient, automatized, and objective assessment of a multi-criteria temporal decision-making problem and gives an unequivocal, clear outcome. The results proved the usability of the developed DSS in the multi-criteria temporal evaluation of sustainable development focused on sustainable cities and communities.\n}

	abstract = {The Chilean coast is a very seismically active region. In the 21st century, the Chilean region experienced 19 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.2 to 8.8, where 597 people were killed. The most dangerous earthquakes occur at the bottom of the ocean. The tsunamis they cause are very dangerous for residents of the surrounding coasts. In 2010, as many as 525 people died in a destructive tsunami caused by an underwater earthquake. Our research paper aims to develop a tsunami simulator based on the modern methodology of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN). We test our model using a tsunami caused by a hypothetical earthquake off the coast of the densely populated area of Valparaiso, Chile. We employ a longest-edge refinement algorithm expressed by graph transformation rules to generate a sequence of triangular computational meshes approximating the seabed and seashore of the Valparaiso area based on the Global Multi-Resolution Topography Data available. For the training of the PINN, we employ points from the vertices of the generated triangular mesh.}

	abstract = {The paper presents a methodology for building concurrent models of decision-making systems based on knowledge extracted from empirical data. We assume that the data is represented by a decision table, while the decision-making system is represented by a Petri net. Decision tables contain conditional attribute values obtained from measurements or other sources. A Petri net is constructed using all true and acceptable rules generated from a given decision table. Rule factors and other parameters needed to build the net model are also computed from the data table. Three operators In, Trs and Out interpreted as uninorms are used to describe the dynamics of the net model. The expected behavior of the model is achieved by proper organization of its work. The theoretical basis of the methodology is the concepts, methods and algorithms derived from the theory of rough sets, fuzzy sets and Petri nets.}

However, such a cooperation is a new concept requiring verification, which is the aim of this paper. The structure of the modeled multidomain network and details about the simulator operation are described. Tests proving correctness of its operation are carried out.

	abstract = {We propose a general algorithm that treats cascade training as a tree search process working according to Dijkstra’s algorithm in contrast to our previous solution based on the branch-and-bound technique. The reason behind the algorithm change is reduction of training time. This change does not affect in anyway the quality of the final classifier. We conduct experiments on cascades trained to become face or letter detectors with Haar-like features or Zernike moments being the input information, respectively. We experiment with different tree sizes and different branching factors. Results confirm that training times of obtained cascades, especially for large heavily branched trees, were reduced. For small trees, the previous technique can sometimes achieve better results but the difference is negligible in most cases.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces a computational framework for optimizing vegetation removal, modelled via so-called blackline or fireline widths, to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness of a prescribed burn for planned reduction of vegetation density. The QUIC FIRE simulation tool is employed to conduct simulations across fireline widths ranging from 8 to 24\xa0m in 2-m increments within a strategically chosen burn unit that covers the usecase of a wildland urban interface located around the region of Auburn, CA. Through visual analysis and quantitative cost function assessment, incorporating polynomial fit and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm within a basin-hopping framework, an optimal fireline width is computed that minimizes costs, efforts and the risk of fire escapes. Findings indicate that strategic adjustments in fireline widths significantly influence the success of prescribed burns, underscoring the value of advanced simulation and optimization techniques. This work provides a foundational framework for subsequent studies, advocating for the development of dynamic, adaptive models that are scalable across varied ecological and geographical settings. Contributions extend to a computational and economic perspective on sustainable risk mitigation, underlining the pivotal influence of technology and advanced modeling in the evolution of prescribed burn strategies.}

	abstract = {Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is an interdisciplinary field that addresses decision-making problems that involve multiple conflicting criteria. MCDA methods are widely applied in various domains, including medicine, management, energy, and logistics. Despite their widespread use, MCDA techniques continuously evolve to address emerging challenges. This paper presents a new method called Stochastic Expected Solution Point SPOTIS (SESP-SPOTIS), for re-identifying MCDA models. SESP-SPOTIS conducts a stochastic search for the Expected Solution Point (ESP) which is then utilized within the Stable Preference Ordering Towards Ideal Solution (SPOTIS) framework. The study delves into comprehensive investigations of MCDA model re-identification and examines how the updated model influences the ranking of analyzed alternatives. Furthermore, the experiments were divided into training sets and tests to evaluate the similarity of the proposed approach, using two rank correlation coefficients, namely Weighted Spearman (\\(r_w\\)) and Weighted Similarity (WS). The results demonstrate that SESP-SPOTIS effectively re-identifies updated models and provides additional information from analysis as an ESP, thereby broadening knowledge and understanding in the decision-making process of the analyzed problem. By integrating machine learning models and stochastic optimization techniques, SESP-SPOTIS contributes to advancing the methodologies for MCDA model re-identification.}

	abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial infrastructure of the Internet, yet it is also a primary medium for disseminating illicit content. Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect malicious domains, with association-based approaches achieving relatively good performance. However, these methods encounter limitations in detecting malicious domains within isolated nodes and heavily relying on labeled data to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised malicious domain detection model named SemiDom, which is based on meta pseudo labeling. Firstly, we use associations among DNS entities to construct a semantically enriched domain association graph. In particular, we retain isolated nodes within the dataset that lack relationships with other entities. Secondly, a teacher network computes pseudo labels on the unlabeled nodes, which effectively augments the scarce labeled data. A student network utilizes these pseudo labels to transform both the structure and attribute features to domain labels. Finally, the teacher network is constantly optimized based on the student’s performance feedback on the labeled nodes, enabling the generation of more precise pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the real-world DNS dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {We propose a technique to circumvent the direct computation of singular surface integrals in parametric integral equation system (PIES) employed for solving three-dimensional potential problems. It is based on the regularization of the original singular PIES formula, resulting in the simultaneous elimination of both strongly and weakly singular integrals. As a result, there is the possibility of numerically calculating the values of all integrals in the obtained formula using standard Gaussian quadrature. The evaluation of accuracy for the proposed approach is examined through an illustrative case, specifically focusing on the steady-state temperature field distribution problem.}

	abstract = {This work investigates the feasibility of applying Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for reconstructing 3D representations of damaged structures caused by the ongoing aggression of Russia against Ukraine. The drone footage depicting the devastation was utilized and three NeRF models, Instant-NGP, Nerfacto, and SplatFacto, were employed. The models were evaluated across various damage levels (0: no damage, 4: high damage) using visual quality metrics like Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and rendering speed metrics like frames per second (FPS) and the number of rays per second (NRS). All input data (videos frames) and evaluation results (rendered visualizations) are available as a Kaggle dataset (http://tiny.cc/srasxz). No clear correlation was observed between damage level and reconstruction quality metrics, suggesting these metrics might not be reliable indicators of damage severity. SplatFacto consistently achieved the highest rendering speed (FPS, NRS) and exhibited the best visual quality (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS) across all damage levels. The findings suggest that NeRFs, particularly SplatFacto, hold promise for rapid reconstruction and visualization of damaged structures, potentially aiding in damage assessment, documentation, and cultural heritage preservation efforts. Moreover, the study sheds light on the potential applications of such advanced modeling techniques in archiving and documenting conflict zones, providing a valuable resource for future investigations, humanitarian efforts, and historical documentation. However, further research is needed to explore the generalizability and robustness of NeRFs in diverse real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {Computational electromagnetics plays a crucial role across diverse domains, notably in fields such as antenna design and radar signature prediction, owing to the omnipresence of electromagnetic phenomena. Numerical methods have replaced traditional experimental approaches, expediting design iterations and scenario characterization. The emergence of GPU accelerators offers an efficient implementation of numerical methods that can significantly enhance the computational capabilities of partial differential equations (PDE) solvers with specific boundary-value conditions. This paper explores parallelization strategies for implementing a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver on GPUs, leveraging shared memory and optimizing memory access patterns to achieve performance gains. One notable innovation presented in this research involves utilizing strategies such as exploiting temporal locality and avoiding misaligned global memory accesses to enhance data processing efficiency. Additionally, we break down the computation process into multiple kernels, each focusing on computing different electromagnetic (EM) field components, to enhance shared memory utilization and GPU cache efficiency. We implement crucial design optimizations to exploit GPU’s parallel processing capabilities fully. These include maintaining consistent block sizes, analyzing optimal configurations for field-updating kernels, and optimizing memory access patterns for CUDA threads within warps. Our experimental analysis verifies the effectiveness of these strategies, resulting in improvements in both reducing execution time and enhancing the GPU’s effective memory bandwidth. Throughput evaluation demonstrates performance gains, with our CUDA implementation achieving up to 17 times higher throughput than CPU-based methods. Speedup gains and throughput comparisons illustrate the scalability and efficiency of our approach, showcasing its potential for developing large-scale electromagnetic simulations on GPUs.}

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to describe computational methods and techniques of investigation of certain algebraic structures needed in order to apply the results in concrete problems in mathematical control theory of nonlinear systems. Contemporary theoretic research requires more and more sophisticated tools for a possible application of the results. In the paper we propose computational tools and techniques for a certain type of simplification of driftless control systems. Such simplification still preserve most crucial properties of the original ones like controllability, but the simplified system have a special feedforward form that is much easier to integrate or allows to solve other problems in control theory. We present the computational procedure and foundations of the library as the extension of existing software libraries in Python language. The approach is illustrated with some numerical experiments and simulations. We conclude with a discussion about related computational issues.}

	abstract = {When solving numerically partial differential equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations, higher-order finite difference schemes are occasionally applied for spacial descretization. Compact finite difference schemes are one of the finite difference schemes and can be used to compute the first-order derivative values with smaller number of stencil grid points, however, a linear system of equations with a tridiagonal or pentadiagonal matrix derived from the schemes have to be solved. In this paper, an asymptotic parallel solver for a reduce matrix, that obtained from the Mattor’s method in a computation of the first-order derivatives with an eighth-order compact difference scheme under a periodic boundary condition, is proposed. The asymptotic solver can be applied as long as the number of grid points of each Cartesian coordinate in the parallelized subdomain is 64 or more, and its computational cost is lower than that of the Mattor’s method. A direct numerical simulation code has also been developed using the two solvers for compressible turbulent flows under isothermal conditions, and optimized on the vector supercomputer SX-Aurora TSUBASA. The optimized code is 1.7 times faster than the original one for a DNS with \\(2048^3\\) grid points and the asymptotic solver achieves approximately a 4-fold speedup compared to the Mattor’s solver. The code exhibits excellent weak scalability.}
