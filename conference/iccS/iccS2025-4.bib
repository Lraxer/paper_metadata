	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of Graph Spectral Clustering (GSC) with negative similarities, resulting from document embeddings different from the traditional Term Vector Space (like doc2vec, GloVe, etc.). Solutions for combinatorial Laplacians and normalized Laplacians are discussed. An experimental investigation shows the advantages and disadvantages of solutions proposed in the literature and in this research. The research demonstrates that GloVe embeddings frequently cause failures of normalized Laplacian based GSC due to negative similarities. Application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also leads to applicability for GloVe embeddings of explanation methods developed for Term Vector Space embeddings.}

	abstract = {A reference model is a model of something that contains a fundamental objective or idea of something and can be established as a reference for multiple purposes. We performed an analysis based on a reference model following the Spanish Ministry of Health’s document of standards and recommendations to achieve better care, efficiency, and uniformity in emergency services. This standard describes the guidelines and resources needed in hospital emergency services for better patient care. We also analyzed the standards of emergency services in the following countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Paraguay, Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. The objective of the research is to analyze the efficiency of the Spanish model following its reference standard compared to the standards of other countries, to explore how the Spanish emergency service would work using the parameters of the emergency service standards compared to the standards of different countries, specifically the KPI we analyzed is the Door to the Doctor (DtD), through simulation. It was concluded that in some countries, DtD times improve compared to the Spanish reference standard, and in some cases, they worsen.}

Our approach employs\xa0a hash-based representation inspired by convolutional neural networks, efficiently encoding peptide fragments as sparse count vectors that capture local sequence context. Using gradient-boosted decision trees, our method achieves mean Hits@5 scores of 3.4318 (hash-based) and 3.5405 (hybrid model with target frequency), significantly outperforming baselines. Transpiling trained models into\xa0Zig enables exceptional computational efficiency, with low memory usage (1180\xa0kB) and a throughput of 388–451 peptides/second even on mobile devices, enabling lightweight, high-speed processing for scalable peptide MRM transition prediction in high-throughput proteomics workflows.}

	abstract = {Numerical simulations are being used to ensure safety in the development of flying cars, which are expected to solve all kinds of traffic problems. In order to reproduce flight in a virtual environment, this research has been conducting numerical simulation research using the moving computational domain method and the multi-axis sliding mesh method to calculate the coupling of fluid and rigid body motion. This method enables rotational motion of the rotor and flight in an infinite region, and visualization of the flow field around the aircraft and its behavior including control. In this study, a comparison of the behavior during sudden rotor stops was performed on two different aircraft: the coaxial contra-rotating octorotor eVTOL treated in a previous study and a newly modeled domed dodecarotor eVTOL. The increased number of rotors and the wider circular arrangement of the rotors allowed for a wider range of measures to be taken in the event of rotor stoppage, and the crash risk was reduced by a factor of approximately 1/100. The differences in crash conditions and changes in aircraft attitude based on a comparison of the two models indicate that this calculation method allows for design improvements and behavior prediction based on relative evaluation.}

We propose efficient attack models to disrupt the rank of the top k centrality vertices. To develop our attack models, we extend the concept of rich clubs of influential vertices to the more general framework of scattered rich clubs–dense subgraphs of high-centrality vertices that are spread across the network. To improve computational efficiency, we use snowball sampling to identify these important substructures. Our results over real-world networks demonstrate that our algorithm can identify the single or scattered rich clubs efficiently and is more effective in disrupting\xa0the centrality rankings of the network, compared to other baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Emergency Departments (EDs) face increasing complexity due to rising patient demand, resource constraints, and the need for efficient service coordination. Traditional simulation models, while useful, cannot be easily adapted to a different hospital environments, making it difficult to transfer and scale solutions. Based on previous work, with a simulator working in a hospital, this work describes a modular Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) approach for increasing flexibility adaptation and reuse in ED simulations. The proposed technique, which deconstructs existing models into individual components, will allow hospitals with different workflows and operational constraints to construct customized simulations. To validate this methodology, we develop a structured, modular framework using NetLogo and Python. The suggested metasystem enables adaptive simulation-based decision assistance for emergency departments, which improves resource allocation and operational planning.}

	abstract = {Selecting appropriate examples for in-context learning significantly impacts the performance of Large Language Models. In this paper, we show that leveraging LLMs’ positional biases and incorporating knowledge of class distribution can improve classification outcomes, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce Class-few-shot, a method that balances class representation among few-shot examples. To investigate this, we conduct almost 10,000 experiments on four datasets and three models, cross-checking how different biases affect models’ performance and how they interact. We show that presenting classes from the most to least numerous using an alternating pattern leads to better results than standard few-shot prompting with the same number of examples. Additionally, we compare the general few-shot and Class-few-shot results, outlining the strengths of both approaches. All of our raw experiment results, prompts and codes are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/olorules/Class-few-shot).}

The flammability of crops varies by season, affecting the behavior of wildfires. This study combines remote sensing indices and machine learning to dynamically update fuel models in cropland zones. Using Sentinel-2 data, the status of the cropland is classified as “planted” or “unplanted”, achieving 80% accuracy. Applied to a 2019 wildfire in Catalonia (Spain), the updated fuel map closely matched the observed fire spread. The methodology outperforms traditional approaches and is efficient, allowing for real-time updates based on seasonal changes.}

	abstract = {Automated classification of bird species is crucial for large-scale environmental monitoring, providing valuable insights into temporal and spatial changes in ecosystems. Previous studies have primarily focused on using either acoustic or visual data for bird species recognition. However, few studies have explored the simultaneous use of both acoustic and visual data to improve classification performance. In this study, we propose a dual branch network based on pre-trained models to enhance bird species classification by integrating acoustic and visual information. Specifically, ResNet50 is used for visual data, while CNN14 is employed for acoustic data. The extracted feature embeddings are then fused, and attention mechanisms are applied to further improve classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to using audio or image data alone. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 96.44%, precision of 96.62%, recall of 94.30%, and F1-score of 95.01%. This study highlights the potential of combining acoustic and visual data for bird species classification and suggests that attention mechanisms can further enhance model performance.}

	abstract = {We present a preliminary study of a model-agnostic method called prototype pair decomposition that generates simple and accurate decision rules from datasets. The research focuses on its application to decision trees. It starts by selecting representative prototypes obtained by a prototype construction method, then pairs of prototypes from opposite classes are determined. These pairs define subspaces containing a fragment of the decision boundary in which a shallow decision tree is applied to extract simple decision rules consisting of a few premises. The results indicate that the proposed solution allows the extraction of locally competent simple rules that are comparable in terms of classification accuracy to a large and complex set of global rules obtained from standard decision trees.}

	abstract = {We propose a latency-optimized neural network model to dynamically predict job execution times for the ALICE experiment at CERN, replacing static Time-To-Live (TTL) allocations. Utilizing Nvidia A100 GPUs, we optimize inference latency via FP16 and INT8 quantization, 2:4 sparsity, quantization-aware training, and graph compilation. Results show that FP16 and sparsity reduce latency for larger batches, while INT8 is optimal for single-sample predictions. For single-sample online inference, static INT8 quantization achieves a median 0.38 ms prediction time, a 1.8x improvement over the 0.71 ms baseline. The model achieves a 1.9-hour RMSE, improving on the 14.23-hour RMSE of current TTL assignments. With sub-40ms inference latency on GPU hardware, this work demonstrates how NN optimization can help achieve performance demands of large-scale distributed computing systems.}

In this paper, enhancements to an RDHEI algorithm utilizing a block-wise pixel value prediction scheme have been analyzed and proposed. To better exploit spatial pixel correlations, seven additional prediction models have been introduced, along with the identification of reference pixels to improve the variable block-wise reconstruction of the carrier data. Furthermore, the integration of Huffman coding within the RDHEI scheme has been evaluated and compared with Extended Run-Length Encoding. Benchmark results against other RDHEI methods from the literature are presented at the end of the paper.}

	abstract = {This study explores the directional flow of price information within the housing market network, focusing on the Seoul metropolitan area from 2013 to 2022. Utilizing a network constructed through the multivariate Granger causality test, centrality metrics identify key industrial cities (e.g., Suwon and Hwaseong) as central nodes. In contrast, Seoul, the capital city, plays a marginal role. The findings reveal a shift in influence within the housing market network, with traditionally dominant cities like Seoul ceding prominence to key industrial hubs. Our findings suggest that spatial and industrial dynamics may now outweigh administrative hierarchy in shaping housing market centrality. Future studies should explore how external shocks have driven this transformation over time.}

	abstract = {Development of modern antennas is a cognitive process that intertwines experience-driven determination of topology and tuning of its parameters to fulfill the performance specifications. Alternatively, the task can be formulated as an optimization problem so as to reduce reliance of geometry selection on engineering insight. In this work, a bi-stage framework for automatic generation of antennas is considered. The method determines free-form topology through optimization of interconnections between components (so-called pixels) that constitute the radiator. Here, the process involves global optimization of connections between pixels followed by fine-tuning of the resulting topology using a surrogate-assisted local-search algorithm to fulfill the design requirements. The approach has been demonstrated based on two case studies concerning development of broadband and dual-band monopole antennas.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we contribute by providing a direct comparison of performance of NAS Parallel Benchmarks implemented\xa0with standard CUDA against our extended implementation with CUDA Graphs. The evaluation was conducted for four hardware platforms, using two desktop GPUs—NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti—and two server-class GPUs—NVIDIA Quadro 8000 and NVIDIA A100 80GB. The primary focus of the comparison was the execution time of the benchmarks, analyzed for various problem sizes (classes S, A, B, C and D). Two applications exhibited noticeable performance gains from the implementation of CUDA Graphs. The CG code demonstrated the most consistent improvements across all cases, achieving an average relative speedup of 3.3%. The highest result of 4.13% (Class C) for this algorithm was achieved for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti card. The LU code showed gains primarily on newer generation GPUs, with an average speedup of 2% on the RTX 4070 Ti and 7%, on the A100, with a maximum gain of 11.87% (Class B). In contrast, visible negative performance was observed for MG and some instances of IS, but we attribute that to the relatively small absolute running time in which case additional overheads cannot be mitigated by the new mechanism.}

The local set border selector (LSBo) algorithm is presented as a Pareto optimal choice between the reduction power of the training set and the classification quality. Its complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\), which means that it is not very advantageous for larger sets. This article presents the Fast LSBo algorithm, which is based on the original idea of the LSBo algorithm. After the applied conceptual changes, the algorithm has achieved a complexity of \\(O(m \\log m)\\). Additionally, the analysis of Fast LSBo on several data sets shows that its classification quality and reduction power remain statistically indistinguishable from the original LSBo algorithm.}

	abstract = {The transportation sector is responsible for approximately \\(23\\%\\) of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with road transportation contributing nearly \\(70\\%\\) of these emissions. The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming this sector by reducing emissions and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. However, the growing number of EVs presents significant challenges for charging infrastructure, particularly in managing long queues, extended wait times, and limited station capacity. Most existing studies on the performance of electric vehicle charging stations assume Poisson arrivals and exponential charging times, simplifications that often overlook real-world variability. This paper introduces a generalized queueing model that leverages empirical interarrival and charging duration data for more accurate performance evaluation. A transient analysis is conducted, examining two operational optimization strategies aimed at minimizing queue sizes during peak demand: (1) a queue management policy that encourages charging only up to a predefined state-of-charge (SoC) threshold instead of the typical 80–100%, and (2) dynamic control of the number of active charging ports based on demand. The results show that these operational optimization policies improve the efficiency of the charging station and significantly improve the customer experience.}

Our paper explores using heterogeneous model soups to improve LLM alignment by combining models trained with different alignment methods - a novel approach not previously explored in literature. Through empirical evaluation using an “LLM-as-a-judge” approach, we found that mixing different types of models can improve alignment performance, though this requires careful adaptation of interpolation techniques to account for varying alignment objectives.

	abstract = {This research introduces a new technique for reduced-cost electromagnetic (EM)-driven multi-objective antenna optimization. Our approach employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to build a surrogate model of antenna frequency characteristics, acting as a fast predictor providing multiple candidate Pareto-optimal solutions per iteration. The surrogate is refined within a machine-learning framework that leverages accumulated EM simulation data. Computational efficiency is enhanced by incorporating variable-fidelity EM simulations. Verification experiments underscrore competitive performance of our method, which requires only two hundred high-resolution EM analyses to complete the MO process. This represents 40% acceleration due to using variable-fidelity models and 90% speedup over traditional single-model surrogate-assisted methods. Our method is also shown competitive concerning design quality.}

	abstract = {Genomic data is growing rapidly due to the high demand for precision medicine. Consequently, efficient genome compression algorithms are needed to reduce storage usage in an acceptable response time. This paper introduces HybridHRCM, a hybrid MPI/OpenMP algorithm that harnesses the power of multicore clusters to compress a collection of genomic sequences. We compared our proposal with MtHRCM-opt, its multi-threaded OpenMP counterpart that is suitable for single-node multicore systems. Experimental results demonstrate that HybridHRCM enhances the scalability of MtHRCM-opt for large test collections when using the same number of cores but in a distributed way, while behaves similarly for small test collections. Furthermore, the results reveal that HybridHRCM still achieving good performance when adding more nodes, for all collections.}

	abstract = {We propose a framework that enriches ontologies by leveraging competency questions and distant supervision. The process begins by using an LLM to extract domain-relevant entities from the questions, followed by incremental refinement through short definitions anchored to a predefined dictionary. These entities and their hierarchies, along with associated queries, are embedded using a fine-tuned Llama3.2:1b and further processed through a self-attention mechanism to create unified representations. A directed acyclic graph models the dependencies between entities, with additional nodes derived from frequent co-occurrences in queries. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used for stable link prediction, discovering latent semantic relationships. These links are then labeled with specific relation types using a fine-tuned RoBERTa module. Evaluations using datasets from HPC training sessions and OpenAlex abstracts show significant improvements in link prediction and ontology enrichment over standard GAT and GraphSage baselines.}

	abstract = {The birth and death of firms govern firm population dynamics, and understanding these processes can guide urban planning and policy. Longitudinal data with full entry and exit records allow direct analysis of birth and death rates and how they depend on external factors and firm-level properties. However, real-world data are often incomplete, with missing records of extinct firms or exit dates. In such cases, it is unclear if and how we can extract information about the birth and death processes. By modeling how these processes shape firms’ age distributions and survival fractions, we show how one can gain insights even from incomplete data. While age distributions are insufficient for inferring both processes, survival fractions reveal how death rates depend on firm age and sector size. Applying our approach to 14 major sectors in Singapore, we find that death rates decline with age and rise with sector size, with a multiplicative interaction between both effects. Assuming sigmoidal dependence on both factors, we infer sector-specific death models that accurately reproduce the data and enable reconstruction of key system features, e.g., sector size trajectories and birth-death rate correlations.}

The textual and visual latent features are integrated using proposed fusion techniques, namely the Basic Fusion Model, Self-Attention Fusion Model, and Dual-Attention Fusion Model.

	abstract = {The complexities of healthcare data, including privacy concerns, imbalanced datasets, and interoperability issues, necessitate innovative machine learning solutions. Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized alternative to Federated Learning, offers privacy-preserving distributed training, but its reliance on blockchain technology hinders accessibility and scalability. This paper introduces a Simplified Peer-to-Peer Swarm Learning (P2P-SL) Framework tailored for resource-constrained environments. By eliminating blockchain dependencies and adopting lightweight peer-to-peer communication, the proposed framework ensures robust mo-del synchronization while maintaining data privacy. Applied to cancer histopathology, the framework integrates optimized pre-trained models, such as TorchXRayVision, enhanced with DenseNet decoders, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in handling imbalanced and biased datasets, achieving comparable performance to centralized models while preserving privacy. This study paves the way for democratizing advanced machine learning in healthcare, offering a scalable, accessible, and efficient solution for privacy-sensitive diagnostic applications.}

This paper proposes an MPI-based distributed architecture where parallel processes share memory to build a distributed hash table. Three DHT approaches for HPC are presented. A lock-free design outperforms both coarse-grained and fine-grained locking DHTs, demonstrating good scaling for read and write performance. The lock-free DHT improved the runtime of a reactive transport simulation up to 42%.}

	abstract = {Seismic monitoring is used to ensure the safety of workers in the rock massif. The main security threat is a rockburst, which can be predicted based on the sequence of seismic events. An important task is to develop a mining forecasting model that can take into account the structural heterogeneity of the mountain range and select the necessary forecast horizon depending on monitoring data. In the paper, we propose a flexible approach that combines multiple machine learning models designed to solve various tasks (clustering, time series forecasting) as parts of one composite model. This approach allows for adjustment of the forecast horizon of the model, which enables it to flexibly adapt to rock massifs with different geological structures and seismic monitoring stations. Also, the use of clustering models allows us to take into account the physical and mechanical features of the rockburst formation process. According to experimental results, the resulting composite model showed more accurate results for specific forecast horizons, compared with classical “hierarchical” models and machine learning models. At the same time, the obtained model allows us to interpret the results from the rock mechanics point of view.}

This paper explores the parallelization of single-GPU and multi-GPU lattice Boltzmann method computations using stdexec and further optimizes performance through its asynchronous execution model. Experimental results show that asynchronous stdexec achieves approximately 83.5%–105.4% of the performance of C++ stdpar. These results suggest potential for further optimizations in the future, providing additional options for high-performance computing development in pure C++.}

We implement optimization techniques that significantly reduce cost and execution time. The impact of particular optimizations is measured in medium-scale experiments followed by a large-scale experiment that leverages all of them and validates the design. Early stopping optimization allows us to reduce the total alignment time by 23%.

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative approach to using computational methods in designing modular housing estates with the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm. Currently, as a result of fast changing humanitarian situations in various parts of the world, like the one caused by the war in Ukraine or climate changes, many people have to leave their homes. It results in complex problem of providing large groups of people with conditions that will allow them to function with dignity for a long time. Therefore the adaptation of the WFC algorithm to design modular settlements is proposed. The applied heuristics allow the solutions to adapt to specific project requirements, generating various modular settlement designs that consider functionality and social aspects. The proposed approach is illustrated by examples of generated arrangements of housing modules for family-type floor plans.}

	abstract = {In recent years, NNs have driven significant advances in machine learning. However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large numbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy demands. VQCs offer a promising alternative: they leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and typically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with different parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the training process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times. Our results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using significantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum technology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that VQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.}

	abstract = {The Multi-Objective Shortest Path (MOSP) problem generalizes the classic shortest path problem by simultaneously optimizing multiple, often conflicting, cost functions. Recent advances in MOSP have yielded algorithms that employ sophisticated heuristic-based techniques and dimensionality reduction to expedite search. However, most existing methods rely on strictly sequential frameworks, leaving parallelized approaches relatively underexplored - especially for high-dimensional objectives. In this paper, we introduce SOPMOA* (Shared-Open Parallelized Multi-Objective A*), an algorithm that addresses this gap by enabling any number of concurrent sub-searchers to cooperate via a shared-memory priority queue. Each sub-searcher independently processes labels, performs dominance checks against locally stored partial Pareto fronts, and contributes to a global frontier of non-dominated solutions. We propose mechanisms for safe and efficient updates to shared data structures, ensuring correctness without excessive locking overhead. Empirical evaluations on benchmark multi-objective road networks demonstrate that SOPMOA* scales favorably with increasing parallelism and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as EMOA*, LTMOA*, and NWMOA* in both speed and robustness. These results underscore the substantial potential of shared-memory parallelization in tackling challenging multi-objective pathfinding tasks.}

	abstract = {Dynamic Programming (DP) is fundamental to computational science education and application, traditionally taught through tabulation methods that emphasize manual loop construction. This paper introduces a modular, systematic plug-and-play framework that greatly simplifies DP algorithm design and parallelization. Our approach begins with\xa0a recursive divide-and-conquer analysis, decomposing DP into reusable components: Refactored Recursion (RR), OrderSpec, TileSpec, dp_solve, dp_tile_solve,\xa0and dag_run. These modules encapsulate recursive structures\xa0and facilitate seamless parallelization via dynamic Directed Acyclic\xa0Graph (DAG) scheduling. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework using three classical textbook problems: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) highlights the plug-and-play simplicity, Matrix\xa0Chain Multiplication (MCM) employs transitive reduction for dependency clarity, and the Cut-Rod problem illustrates previously obscured tiling optimizations and parallel solutions. This new modular paradigm significantly reduces DP’s learning curve, shifting educational\xa0focus from code-centric methods to intuitive, reusable patterns, bridging theoretical recursion with practical implementations and greatly enhancing computational science education.}

Unlike traditional dictionary-based methods requiring extensive manual review, NeoN combines reference corpora, Polish-specific linguistic filters, an LLM-driven precision-boosting filter, and daily RSS monitoring in a multi-layered pipeline. The system uses context-aware lemmatization, frequency analysis, and orthographic normalization to extract candidate neologisms while consolidating inflectional variants. Researchers can verify candidates through an intuitive interface with visualizations and filtering controls. An integrated LLM module automatically generates definitions. Evaluations show NeoN maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing manual effort, providing an accessible solution for tracking lexical innovation in Polish (The prompt templates and a number of NeoN interface screenshots are available at https://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/NeoN-appendix).}

However, the wide range of parameter values and their varying impact across systems make traditional identification methods insufficient, highlighting the need for new approaches to performance prediction and parameter tuning. We propose Surrogate-Based Modeling (SBM) as an efficient method for characterizing performance across the parameter landscape. Using data from the RAJA Performance Suite’s computational kernels (RAJAPerf), we show that SBM outperforms the standard k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model, achieving predictions up to 54% more accurate while requiring 33% less data. Thus, SBM emerges as a powerful tool for enhancing performance predictions across diverse parameter combinations.}

Leveraging advances in computer vision, we propose a novel cattle recognition framework combining Vision Transformers with two-dimensional masked Retention Networks. Evaluated on a self-collected video dataset of 50 cattle, focused on muzzle features, our model efficiently handles high-resolution frames and achieves 91.5% accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The Retention Network enhances scalability by reducing computational overhead, making the system robust under challenging conditions like occlusions and variable lighting. Our approach provides a practical and high-performing solution for automated cattle identification in precision livestock farming.}

	abstract = {Urban scaling studies have gained popularity in the last two decades, summarising urban attributes’ variation with population. Recent research, however, highlights scaling exponents’ sensitivity to industry-specific dynamics, population cut-offs, and data distribution. Despite this, few studies systematically examine industry scaling using plant-level data while accounting for sector-specific externalities. This study addresses that gap by analysing longitudinal data on green electricity firms across 968 NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics)-3 regions in 14 European countries (1985–2023). We assess how scaling exponents for firm entry and concentration vary across population cutoffs, both with and without controls for agglomeration externalities. Our findings reveal predominantly sublinear scaling, suggesting that population size alone does not drive green energy growth. Concentration consistently scales more strongly than entry, indicating that large cities are more conducive to firm survival than to the creation of new firms. When agglomeration externalities are not controlled for, scaling exponents are systematically underestimated. While variability is observed in regions at population extremes, results remain robust across cutoffs, especially when using inverse thresholds. Comparative analysis with high-tech service and manufacturing sectors confirms sublinear scaling in entry across all sectors, with green electricity showing the lowest exponent, reinforcing its maturity and low innovation intensity. These findings align with the Smart Specialization framework, emphasizing the importance of targeted institutional support, supplier networks, and sector-specific strategies. They also highlight the potential for smaller or lagging regions to take a more active role in the green transition, particularly within cohesion policy efforts.}

	abstract = {Spitzbergen is Norway’s largest island, located in the Svalbard archipelago of the Polar Circle region. The island’s population is currently about two and a half thousand, and it works mainly in natural resource extraction, tourism, and scientific research. The subject of our interest is the town of Longyearbyen, the capital of Spitzbergen, with a population of about 1,800. It has an airport and, until recently, the only power plant in Norway that generated electricity by burning coal. The coal has been replaced recently with diesel generators to reduce the pollution output, but the problem is still there. In this paper, we present the hypergraph grammar-based model of mesh generation and finite element pollution propagation simulations at Svalbard at Spitzbergen. We also perform in-field pollution measurements with snowmobiles. The simulations and measurements have been performed in March 2024. We compare our simulation results with in-field measurements.}

	abstract = {Extracting high-level conceptual models from simulation code can benefit model validation and verification, system optimisation, and cross-disciplinary communication. However, conceptual models are often embedded within implementation details, making them difficult to access and interpret. This paper explores the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer conceptual models from simulation code. We conduct a preliminary investigation on an agent-based simulation (Flee), demonstrating how LLMs can extract key structural, behavioural, and temporal elements. Our results suggest that LLMs can generate meaningful conceptual representations that align with expert-created models, offering potential support for model verification. However, we also identify limitations such as omissions and misinterpretations, highlighting the need for human oversight. While our study is based on a single example, it provides initial insights into the role of LLMs in conceptual model inference and their potential integration into simulation validation workflows.}

This paper proposes a hybrid CUDA-based implementation to overcome these limitations, enabling efficient processing of HMMs with massive state spaces and extended observation sequences. Key optimizations include log-space computations for numerical stability, memory-efficient data partitioning with sparse matrix representations, and asynchronous data transfers using CUDA streams to overlap host-device communication with GPU kernel execution. Our approach achieves significant performance improvements, demonstrating up to \\(8.5\\times \\) speedup over multi-threaded CPU implementations for HMM processing.}

In this work, we present a study on forecasting scientific collaborations using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with L2 regularization and dropout. We construct yearly co-authorship graphs based on historical publication data and analyze the evolution of these graphs over time with the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) as an example of a living scientific community. Our approach involves training on past yearly graphs to predict the formation of new edges in future graphs. We assess the model’s performance by varying the prediction window and evaluating results using link prediction metrics. The proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing deep learning techniques for predicting future collaborations based on past scientific interactions.}

The DCEx programming paradigm exploits private data structures and limits the amount of shared data among parallel threads in HPC applications. The key idea of DCEx is structuring programs into data-parallel blocks mapped on computing elements and managed in parallel by a large number of parallel tasks. Data-parallel blocks are the units of shared- and distributed-memory parallel computations and communications in the memory/storage hierarchy. Tasks execute close to data using near-data synchronization according to the PGAS model. Two use cases implemented using DCEx constructs are also outlined and performance measures on different parallel machine configurations are shown.}

This study proposes DE-UNet, an enhanced U-Net architecture optimized using Differential Evolution (DE) to improve segmentation of multimodal MRI scans. The model was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: Figshare Brain Tumor Segmentation (FBTS) and BraTS 2021 datasets, focusing on whole tumor segmentation across four MRI modalities: FLAIR, T1, T1-CE, and T2. DE-UNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard Index (JI) scores of 0.9160/0.8472 on FBTS and 0.9094/0.8371 on BraTS 2021. DE effectively optimized key hyperparameters—learning rate, dropout, batch size, and filter sizes—enhancing the model generalization across tumor types and imaging conditions. Visual analysis confirmed accurate tumor boundary delineation. These results highlight the potential of DE-UNet as a robust and precise tool for clinical brain tumor segmentation.}

	abstract = {With Human – Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaboration booming in all fields, the pace of task-based cooperation is ever-expanding. Yet, in most applications, AI induction is sidelined to test beds and is perceived skeptically as a competitor rather than a collaborator. The healthcare domain is one field where AI support is viewed as theoretical and far from practical. While most focus is directed towards developing and training AI models, the human expert and their interactions with the AI model are often overlooked. We present an experiment that incorporates, the personalization of human experts into the AI’s model training, aiming to improve collaboration and overall outcome. Using a simulation-based approach, we optimize the AI learning policy of a domain expert’s behaviour when evaluating decision support data of a patient’s risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With Linear and Maximum Entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms, we analyze various learning strategies by including context, rewards and sampling rates to show personalized expert characteristics with optimal policies and effective reward functions respectively. Our results provide insights into experts’ personalized evaluation policy and the AI model’s learning behaviour in various environmental scenarios and further the implicit difference in the evaluation of domain experts.}
