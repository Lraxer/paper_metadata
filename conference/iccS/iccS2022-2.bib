	abstract = {Within the field of causal inference, we consider the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from data. We propose and validate a novel approach for learning feature representations to aid the estimation of the conditional average treatment effect or cate. Our method focuses on an intermediate layer in a neural network trained to predict the outcome from the features. In contrast to previous approaches that encourage the distribution of representations to be treatment-invariant, we leverage a genetic algorithm to optimize over representations useful for predicting the outcome to select those less useful for predicting the treatment. This allows us to retain information within the features useful for predicting outcome even if that information may be related to treatment assignment. We validate our method on synthetic examples and illustrate its use on a real life dataset.}

Obtained interval modified fast PIES is used to model the uncertainty of measurement data, which are necessary to define boundary shape. The uncertainty was defined using interval numbers and modelled using modified directed interval arithmetic previously developed by the authors. The reliability and efficiency of the interval modified fast PIES solutions obtained using such arithmetic were verified on 2D complex potential problems with polygonal domains. The solutions were compared with the interval solutions obtained by the interval PIES. All performed tests indicated high efficiency of the interval modified fast PIES method.}

	abstract = {Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is that such a validation is not straightforward, because the validation typically needs to be performed with respect to noisy extreme values rather than expected values. This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area that encompasses all observed reached positions up\xa0to a manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of real-world player motion.}

	abstract = {Kubernetes has gained extreme popularity as a\xa0cloud-native platform for distributed applications. However, scientific computations which typically consist of a\xa0large number of jobs – such as scientific workflows – are not typical workloads for which Kubernetes was designed. In this paper, we investigate the problem of autoscaling, i.e. adjusting the computing infrastructure to the current resource demands. We propose a\xa0solution for auto-scaling that takes advantage of the known workflow structure to improve scaling decisions by predicting resource demands for the near future. Such a\xa0predictive autoscaling policy is experimentally evaluated and compared to a\xa0regular reactive policy where only the current demand is taken into account. The experimental evaluation is done using the HyperFlow workflow management systems running five simultaneous instances of the Montage workflow on a\xa0Kubernetes cluster deployed in the Google Cloud Platform. The results indicate that the predictive policy allows achieving better elasticity and execution time, while reducing monetary cost.}

	abstract = {Scene classification carry out an imperative accountability in the current emerging field of automation. Traditional classification methods endure with tedious processing techniques. With the advent of CNN and deep learning models have greatly accelerated the job of scene classification. In our paper we have considered an area of application where the deep learning can be used to assist in the civil and military applications and aid in navigation. Current image classifications concentrate on the various available labeled datasets of various images. This work concentrates on classification of few scenes that contain pictures of people and places that are affected in the areas of flood. This aims at assisting the rescue officials at the need of natural calamities, disasters, military attacks etc. Proposed work explains a classifying system which can categorize the small scene dataset using transfer learning approach. We collected the pictures of scenes from sites and created a small dataset with different flood affected activities. We have utilized transfer learning model, RESNET in our proposed work which showed an accuracy of 88.88% for ResNet50 and 91.04% for ResNet101 and endow with a faster and economical revelation for the application involved.}

In [1], Schaeffer proposed a machine learning algorithm to learn the differential equation via data discovery.

That is why there is a need to create robust and efficient methods that automatically help to do this task. In this paper, music genre recognition is implemented by exploiting the potential of wide ensembles of neural network classifiers. Creating infrequently used types of ensembles is a main contribution of authors in the development of automatic recognition of the musical genre. The paper shows how it can be done in a relatively quick and straightforward manner. The presented method can be implemented in many other use cases.}

We exploit particle swarm optimization to select the pivotal hyper-parameters of a route minimization algorithm applied to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows.

	abstract = {Zero-shot learning is applied, for instance, when properly labeled training data is not available. A number of zero-shot algorithms have been proposed. However, since none of them seems to be an “overall winner”, development of a meta-classifier(s) combining “best aspects” of individual classifiers can be attempted. In this context, state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods are compared for standard benchmark datasets. Next, multiple meta-classifiers are applied to the same datasets.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we design an agent-based modeling simulation that represents the solitary behavior in tigers and utilizes it in encoding image information. Our model mainly depends on converting the digital data to a virtual environment with paths classified based on the allocation of the data in the original image. Then, we introduce virtual tigers to the environment to begin the encoding process. Tiger agents are separated from each other, and the algorithm monitors their movements and keeps them away from each other. This separation in the virtual environment allows tigers to encode information that exists in different image parts. Additionally, tigers follow a relative movement style that encodes each tiger’s movement direction based on the previous one. This encoding approach allows particular movements that occur in different directions to be encoded in a similar way. After that, we apply Huffman coding to the chain of movements, the purpose of which is to reduce the size and have a new representation. The experimental findings reveal that we could obtain better results than leading standards in bi-level image compression, including JBIG family methods. Our outcomes strengthen the findings of previous studies that incorporated biological behaviors within agent-based modeling simulations and provide a new abstraction to be utilized in information processing research.}

	abstract = {The human brain can quickly become overwhelmed by the amounts of data computers can process. Consequently, data abstraction is necessary for a user to grasp information and identify valuable patterns. Data is usually abstracted in a pictorial or graphical format. Nowadays, users demand more personalization from the systems they use. This work proposes a user-centered framework that aims to ease creating visualizations for the developers of a platform while offering the end-user a highly customizable experience. The conceptualized solution was prototyped and tested to ensure the information about the data is transmitted to the user in a quick and effective manner. The results of a user study showed that users are pleased with the usability of the prototype and prove that they desire control over the configuration of their visualizations. This work not only confirmed the usefulness of previously explored personalization options for visual representations, but also explored promising new personalization options.\n}

	abstract = {Structural pounding is considered as one of the most critical phenomena occurring during earthquakes. This paper presents the incremental dynamic analysis and fragility assessment of buildings experiencing earthquake-induced pounding. Three 3-D buildings with different number of storeys and under different structural arrangements have been considered. Three pounding scenarios have been taken into account, i.e. pounding between 5-storey and 7-storey buildings, pounding between 5-storey and 9-storey buildings and pounding between 7-storey and 9-storey buildings. The incremental dynamic analysis and fragility assessment has been performed for these three buildings in the three pounding scenarios as well as for the no pounding case. The results of both incremental dynamic analysis and fragility assessment illustrate that pounding can be beneficial and destructive, depending on the structural response and ground motion shift versus time. No clear relation has been observed because pounding is a highly complicated phenomenon.}

The solution of the system of equations resulting from the 3D discretization of the implicit time integration scheme with the Crank-Nicolson method has \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^2)\\) complexity using direct solver, resulting in the exact solution. Iterative solvers (e.g., multi-grid solvers) deliver \\(\\mathcal{O}(Nk)\\) computational cost resulting in an approximate solution. The alternating direction implicit solver delivers \\(\\mathcal{O}(N)\\) complexity instead; it provides the exact solution (as the direct solver). Still, it requires a regular tensor product structure of the material data. In this paper, we propose a method for generalizing the linear computational cost alternating direction implicit solver using the Crank-Nicolson scheme into non-regular material data.}

The model is based on the so-called total dissonance function. The behavior of the system depends on the competition between the latter and social temperature. We focus on a special case of parental and peer influence on adolescents. In such a case, as the temperature rises, Monte Carlo simulations reveal a sharp transition between a state with and a state without private-public opinion discrepancy. This may have far-reaching consequences for developing marketing strategies.}

	abstract = {As more and more people continue to live in highly urbanised areas across the globe, reliable accessibility to amenities and services plays a vital role in sustainable development. One of the challenges in addressing this issue is the consistent and equal provision of public services, including transport for residents across the urban system. In this study, using a novel computational method combining geometrical analysis and information-theoretic measures, we analyse the accessibility to public transport in terms of the spatial coverage of the transport nodes (stops) and the quality of service at these nodes across different areas. Furthermore, using a network clustering procedure, we also characterise the land-use pattern of those areas and relate that to their public transport accessibility. Using Singapore as a case study, we find that the commercial areas in its central business district expectedly have excellent accessibility and the residential areas also have good to very good accessibility. However, not every residential area is equally accessible. While the spatial coverage of stops in these areas is very good, the quality of service indicates substantial variation among different regions, with high contrast between the central and eastern areas compared to the others in the west and north of the city-state. We believe this kind of analysis could yield a good understanding of the current level of public transport services across the urban system, and their disparity will provide valuable and actionable insights into future development plans.}

In this paper, we propose a modification of this method, which relies on the use of fractional order derivatives. The proposed modification is evaluated twofold: visually via polynomiographs coloured according to the number of iterations, and numerically by using the convergence area index, the average number of iterations and generation time of polynomiographs. The experimental results show that the fractional pseudo-Newton method for some fractional orders behaves better in comparison to the standard algorithm.}

	abstract = {More and more users are attracted by P2P networks characterized by decentralization, autonomy and anonymity. The management and optimization of P2P networks have become the important research contents. This paper presents a framework for network self-evolving problem based on distributed swarm intelligence, which is achieved by the collaboration of different nodes. Each node, as an independent agent, only has the information of its local topology. Through the consensus method, each node searches for an evolving structure to evolve its local topology. The self-evolving of each node’s local topology makes the whole topology converge to the optimal topology model. In the experiments, two simulated examples under different network topologies illustrate the feasibility of our approach.}

	abstract = {Civil engineering structures may seriously suffer from different damage states result of earthquakes. Nowadays, retrofitting the existing buildings is a serious need among designers. Two important factors of required performance level and cost of retrofitting play a crucial role in the retrofitting approach. In this study, a new optimal computational strategy to retrofit structures by implementing linear Viscous Dampers (VDs) is investigated to achieve a higher performance level with lower implementation cost. Regarding this goal, a Tcl programming code was developed with the capability of considering damaged structure due to earthquake-induced structural pounding. The code allows us to improve structural models to take into account the real condition of buildings using both MATLAB and Opensees software simultaneously. To present the capability of this strategy, the 3-, and 6-story colliding Steel Moment-Resisting Frames (SMRFs) were selected. Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) was performed based on the interstory drift ratio of floor levels as engineering demand parameter, and Sa(T1) as intensity measure. Interstory median IDAs of floor levels of colliding SMRFs were plotted to find out the floor level prone to damage and to retrofit only this floor level instead of all stories. The results show that implementing only two linear VDs with a cost of two units can achieve a higher life safety performance level in the case of 3-, and 6-story SMRFs. Moreover, the proposed computational strategy can be used for any structure (with and without pounding conditions), and in all performance levels prescribed in FEMA 356 code.\n}

	abstract = {Time series classification is a supervised learning problem that aims at labelling time series according to their class belongingness. Time series can be of variable length. Many algorithms have been proposed, among which feature-based approaches play a key role, but not all of them are able to deal with time series of unequal lengths. In this paper, a new feature-based approach to time series classification is proposed. It is based on ARIMA models constructed for each time series to be classified. In particular, it uses ARIMA coefficients to form a classification model together with sampled time series data points. The proposed method was tested on a suite of benchmark data sets and obtained results are compared with those provided by the state-of-the-art approaches.\n}

	abstract = {Classification of Boolean functions requires specific software or circuits to determine the class of a function or even to distinguish between two different classes. In order to provide a less costly solution, we study the approximation of the NPN function classification by a artificial neural network (ANN), and shown that there are configurations of ANN that can perfectly classify four-bit Boolean functions. Additionally, we look at the possibility of learning the classification of four-bit Boolean functions using a set of three-bit Boolean neural classifiers, and determine the scalability. Finally we also learn a discriminator that can distinguish between two functions and determine their similarity or difference in their NPN classes. As a result we show that the approximate neural function classification is a convenient approach to implement an efficient classifier and class discriminator directly from the data.\n}

	abstract = {The multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) method is one of the parallel-in-time approaches for time-dependent PDEs and typically uses rediscretized coarse-grid operators. As their convergence struggle with hyperbolic problems, an optimization method for coarse-grid operators has been proposed to deal with these problems. This method improves convergence using coarse-grid operators with a slightly increased number of nonzero elements. However, it is more desirable for coarse-grid operators to be cheaper than fine-grid operators, and there is room for improvement in terms of parallel implementation. This work combines the spatial redistribution technique for MGRIT, which accelerates coarse-grid solvers using agglomerated idle processors, with the above optimization method. This combination attempts to achieve better scaling performance while maintaining good convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate a 23% runtime reduction at most among the various assignments tried with specific amount of parallelism.\n}

The proposed network approach allows us to effectively search for a cluster of reservoirs-analogues and restore missing parameters in the target reservoir based on the found clusters of reservoirs-analogues. Also, the network approach was compared with the baseline approach and showed greater efficiency. Three approaches were also compared to restore gaps in the target reservoir using clusters of reservoirs-analogues.}

Our heuristic method, which was designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, has evolved and can adapt to other optimization problems, such as the KP01 that can be organized in an n-Dimensional search space. Regarding the methodology, we substantially reduced the search space while the areas of interest were located in the clustering stage, which brings us closer to the best solutions. After the experiments, we obtained a high-quality solution, which resulted in an average success rate of above 90%.}

	abstract = {One of the leading approaches for solving various hard discrete problems is designing advanced solvers based on local search heuristics. This observation is also relevant to the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) – an open hard optimisation problem that has many applications. There are a lot of dedicated heuristics such as the steepest-descent local search algorithm (SDLS), Tabu search or xLostovka algorithms. This paper introduce a new concept of combining well-known solvers with neural networks that improve the solvers’ parameters based on the local context. The contribution proposes the extension of Tabu search (one of the well-known optimisation heuristics) with the LSTM neural network to optimise the number of iterations for which particular bits are blocked. Regarding the presented results, it should be concluded that the proposed approach is a very promising direction for developing highly efficient heuristics for LABS problem.}

	abstract = {Student success prediction is one of the many applications of artificial intelligence (AI) which helps educators identify the students requiring tailored support. The intelligent algorithms used for this task consider various factors to make accurate decisions. However, the decisions produced by these models often become ineffective due to lack of explainability and trust. To fill this gap, this paper employs several machine learning models on a real-world dataset to predict students’ learning outcomes from their social media usage. By leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to investigate the model outcomes, we conduct a critical analysis of the model outcomes. We found several sensitive features were considered important by these models which can lead to questions of trust and fairness regarding the use of such features. Our findings were further evaluated by a real-world user study.}

	abstract = {Agent-based models frequently make use of scaling techniques to render the simulated samples of population more tractable. The degree to which this scaling has implications for model forecasts, however, has yet to be explored; in particular, no research on the spatial implications of this has been done. This work presents a simulation of the spread of Covid-19 among districts in Zimbabwe and assesses the extent to which results vary relative to the samples upon which they are based. It is determined that in particular, different geographical dynamics of the spread of disease are associated with varying population sizes, with implications for others seeking to use scaled populations in their research.}

	abstract = {The crack propagation behavior can be considered a time-series forecasting problem and can be observed based on the changes of the Phase-field variable. In this work, we study the behavior of the Isotropic Brittle Fracture Model (BFM), and propose a hybrid computational technique that involves a time-series forecasting method for finding results faster when solving variational equations with a fine-grained. We use this case study to compare and contrast two different time-series forecasting approaches: ARIMA, a statistical method, and LSTM, a neural network learning-based method. The study shows both methods come with different strengths and limitations. However, ARIMA method stands out due to its robustness and flexibility, especially when training data is limited because it can exploit a priori knowledge.}

	abstract = {The cross-correlation function appears in many fields with time-series data, and speeding up the computation is essential given the recent accumulation of significant amounts of data. The cross-correlation function can be calculated as a matrix-matrix product, and a significant speed-up can be expected utilizing Tensor Core, which is a matrix-matrix product acceleration unit of the latest NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In this research, we target a new precision data type called the TensorFloat-32, which is available in the Ampere architecture. We develop a fast calculation method considering the characteristics of the cross-correlation function and TensorCore. Our method achieved a very high performance of 53.56 TFLOPS in the performance measurement assuming seismic interferometry using actual data, which is 5.97 times faster than cuBLAS, a widely used linear algebra library on NVIDIA GPUs. In addition, the accuracy of the calculation result is sufficiently high compared to the 64-bit floating-point calculation, indicating the applicability of Tensor Core operations using TensorFloat-32 for scientific calculations. Our proposed method is expected to make it possible to utilize a large amount of data more effectively in many fields.}

	abstract = {Porting a complex scientific code, such as the E3SM land model (ELM), onto a new computing architecture is challenging. The paper presents design strategies and technical approaches to develop an ELM ecosystem dynamics model with compiler directives (OpenACC) on NVIDIA GPUs. The code has been refactored with advanced OpenACC features (such as deepcopy and routine directives) to reduce memory consumption and to increase the levels of parallelism through parallel loop reconstruction and new data structures. As a result, the optimized parallel implementation achieved more than a 140-time speedup (50 ms vs 7600 ms), compared to a naive implementation that uses OpenACC routine directive and parallelizes the code across existing loops on a single NVIDIA V100. On a fully loaded computing node with 44 CPUs and 6 GPUs, the code achieved over a 3.0-times speedup, compared to the original code on the CPU. Furthermore, the memory footprint of the optimized parallel implementation is 300 MB, which is around 15% of the 2.15 GB of memory consumed by a naive implementation. This study is the first effort to develop the ELM component on GPUs efficiently to support ultra-high-resolution land simulations at continental scales.}

	abstract = {Inverse design that directly predicts multiple structural characteristics of nanomaterials based on a set of desirable properties is essential for translating computational predictions into laboratory experiments, and eventually into products. This is challenging due to the high-dimensionality of nanomaterials data which causes an imbalance in the mapping problem, where too few properties are available to predict too many features. In this paper we use multi-target machine learning to directly map the structural features and property labels, without the need for exhaustive data sets or external optimization, and explore the impact of more aggressive feature selection to manage the mapping function. We find that systematically reducing the dimensionality of the feature set improves the accuracy and generalizability of inverse models when interpretable importance profiles from the corresponding forward predictions are used to prioritize inclusion. This allows for a balance between accuracy and efficiency to be established on a case-by-case basis, but raises new questions about the role of domain knowledge and pragmatic preferences in feature prioritization strategies.}

	abstract = {Activation function plays an important role in neural networks. We propose to use hat activation function, namely the first order B-spline, as activation function for CNNs including MgNet and ResNet. Different from commonly used activation functions like ReLU, the hat function has a compact support and no obvious spectral bias. Although spectral bias is thought to be beneficial for generalization, we show that MgNet and ResNet with hat function still exhibit a slightly better generalization performance than CNNs with ReLU function by our experiments of classification on MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets. This indicates that CNNs without spectral bias can have a good generalization capability. We also illustrate that although hat function has a small activation area which is more likely to induce vanishing gradient problem, hat CNNs with various initialization methods still works well.}

Instead of using the Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is the concatenation of linear operators and activation functions, to approximate the solutions of PDEs, we employ the linear combination of higher-order and continuity base functions, as employed by IGA. In this paper, we compare two methods. The first method trains different DNN for each coefficient of the linear computations. The second method trains one DNN for all coefficients of the linear combination. We show on model L-shape domain problem that training several small DNNs learning how to span B-splines coefficients is more efficient.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we initiate the study of isogeometric analysis (IGA) of a quantum three-body problem that has been well-known to be difficult to solve. In the IGA setting, we represent the wavefunctions by linear combinations of B-spline basis functions and solve the problem as a matrix eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue gives the eigenstate energy while the eigenvector gives the coefficients of the B-splines that lead to the eigenstate. The major difficulty of isogeometric or other finite-element-method-based analyses lies in the lack of boundary conditions and a large number of degrees of freedom required for accuracy. For a typical many-body problem with attractive interaction, there are bound and scattering states where bound states have negative eigenvalues. We focus on bound states and start with the analysis for a two-body problem. We demonstrate through various numerical experiments that IGA provides a promising technique to solve the three-body problem.}

	abstract = {The main idea of our Goal-Oriented Adaptive (GOA) strategy is based on performing global and uniform h- or p-refinements (for h- and p-adaptivity, respectively) followed by a coarsening step, where some basis functions are removed according to their estimated importance. Many Goal-Oriented Adaptive strategies represent the error in a Quantity of Interest (QoI) in terms of the bilinear form and the solution of the direct and adjoint problems. However, this is unfeasible when solving indefinite or non-symmetric problems since symmetric and positive definite forms are needed to define the inner product that guides the refinements. In this work, we provide a Goal-Oriented Adaptive (h- or p-) strategy whose error in the QoI is represented in another bilinear symmetric positive definite form than the one given by the adjoint problem. For that purpose, our Finite Element implementation employs a multi-level hierarchical data structure that imposes Dirichlet homogeneous nodes to avoid the so-called hanging nodes. We illustrate the convergence of the proposed approach for 1D Helmholtz and convection-dominated problems.\n}

	abstract = {The rate of penetration (ROP) is a key performance indicator in the oil and gas drilling industry as it directly translates to cost savings and emission reductions. A prerequisite for a drilling optimization algorithm is a predictive model that provides expected ROP values in response to surface drilling parameters and formation properties. The high predictive capability of current machine-learning models comes at the cost of excessive data requirements, poor generalization, and extensive computation requirements. These practical issues hinder ROP models for field deployment. Here we address these issues through transfer learning. Simulated and real data from the Volve field were used to pre-train models. Subsequently, these models were fine-tuned with varying retraining data percentages from other Volve wells and Marcellus Shale wells. Four out of the five test cases indicate that retraining the base model would always produce a model with lower mean absolute error than training an entirely new model or using the base model without retraining. One was on par with the traditional approach. Transfer learning allowed to reduce the training data requirement from a typical 70% down to just 10%. In addition, transfer learning reduced computational costs and training time. Finally, results showed that simulated data could be used in the absence of real data or in combination with real data to train a model without trading off model’s predictive capability.}

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks allow models to be trained by physical laws described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. However, traditional architectures of this approach struggle to solve more challenging time-dependent problems. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed framework for solving time-dependent partial differential equations. Using only the governing differential equations and problem initial and boundary conditions, we generate a latent representation of the problem’s spatio-temporal dynamics. Our model utilizes discrete cosine transforms to encode spatial frequencies and re-current neural networks to process the time evolution. This efficiently and flexibly produces a compressed representation which is used for additional conditioning of physics-informed models. We show experimental results on the Taylor-Green vortex solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Taylor-Green vortex relative to other physics-informed baseline models.}

	abstract = {The isogeometric analysis (IGA) uses higher-order and continuity basis functions as compared to the traditional finite element method. IGA has many applications in simulations of time-dependent problems. These simulations are often performed using an explicit time-integration scheme, which requires the solution of a system of linear equations with the mass matrix, constructed with high-order and continuity basis functions. The iterative solvers are most commonly applied for large problems simulated over complex geometry. This paper focuses on recursive decomposition of the mass matrix using the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm (SVD). We build a recursive tree, where submatrices are expressed as multi-columns multiplied by multi-rows. When we keep the mass matrix compressed in such a way, the multiplication of a matrix by a vector, as performed by an iterative solver, can be performed in O(Nr) instead of \\(O(N^2)\\) computational cost, where N is the number of rows of input matrix, r is the number of singular values bigger than given value. Next, we focus on refined isogeometric analysis (rIGA). We introduce the C0 separators into IGA submatrices and analyze the SVD recursive compression and computational cost of an iterative solver when increasing the patch size and the order of B-spline basis functions.\n}

	abstract = {The main goal of the research presented in this paper was to estimate the performance of applying neural networks trained with the usage of a chaotic model, that may serve as hashing functions. The Lorenz Attractor chaotic model was used for training data preparation, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient was used as a training algorithm. Networks consisted of two layers: a hidden layer with sigmoid neurons and an output layer with linear neurons. The method of bonding the input message with chaotic formula is presented. Created networks could return 256 or 512 bits of hash, however, this parameter can be easily adjusted before the training process. The performance analysis of networks is discussed (that is the time of hash computation) in comparison with popular standards SHA-256 and SHA-512 under the MATLAB environment. Further research may include analysis of networks’ training parameters (like mean squared error or gradient) or analysis of results of the statistical tests performed on networks output. The presented solution may be used as a security algorithm complementary to a certificated one (for example for additional data integrity checking).}

	abstract = {Quite recently some noteworthy papers appeared showing classes of deep neural network (DNN) training tasks where rather simple one-population evolutionary algorithms (EA) found better solutions than gradient-based optimization methods. However, it is well known that simple single-population evolutionary algorithms generally suffer from the problem of getting stuck in local optima. A multi-population adaptive evolutionary strategy called Hierarchic Memetic Strategy (HMS) is designed especially to mitigate this problem. HMS was already shown to outperform single-population EAs in general multi-modal optimization and in inverse problem solving. In this paper we describe an application of HMS to the DNN training tasks where the above-mentioned single-population EA won over gradient methods. Obtained results show that HMS finds better solutions than the EA when using the same time resources, therefore proving the advantage of HMS over not only the EA but in consequence also over gradient methods.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables building a shared model from multicentre data while storing the training data locally for privacy. In this paper, we present an evaluation (called CXR-FL) of deep learning-based models for chest X-ray image analysis using the federated learning method. We examine the impact of federated learning parameters on the performance of central models. Additionally, we show that classification models perform worse if trained on a region of interest reduced to segmentation of the lung compared to the full image. However, focusing training of the classification model on the lung area may result in improved pathology interpretability during inference. We also find that federated learning helps maintain model generalizability. The pre-trained weights and code are publicly available at (https://github.com/SanoScience/CXR-FL).}

	abstract = {A critical step in the fight against COVID-19, which continues to have a catastrophic impact on peoples lives, is the effective screening of patients presented in the clinics with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Chest radiography is one of the promising screening approaches. Many studies reported detecting COVID-19 in chest X-rays accurately using deep learning. A serious limitation of many published approaches is insufficient attention paid to explaining decisions made by deep learning models. Using explainable artificial intelligence methods, we demonstrate that model decisions may rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology. After an analysis of potential confounding factors found on chest X-ray images, we propose a novel method to minimise their negative impact. We show that our proposed method is more robust than previous attempts to counter confounding factors such as ECG leads in chest X-rays that often influence model classification decisions. In addition to being robust, our method achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at (https://github.com/tomek1911/POTHER).}

	abstract = {This work presents a mathematical model to describe perfusion dynamics in cardiac tissue. The new model extends a previous one and can reproduce clinical exams of contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left ventricle obtained from patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarct. The model treats the extra- and intravascular domains as different porous media where Darcy’s law is adopted. Reaction-diffusion-advection equations are used to capture the dynamics of contrast agents that are typically used in MRI perfusion exams. The identification of the myocardial infarct region is modeled via adsorption of the contrast agent on the extracellular matrix. Different scenarios were simulated and compared with clinical images: normal perfusion, endocardial ischemia due to stenosis, and myocardial infarct. Altogether, the results obtained suggest that the models can support the process of non-invasive cardiac perfusion quantification.}

In this paper we focus on the identification of dense subgraphs in temporal protein-protein interaction networks, a relevant problem to find group of proteins related to a given functionality. We consider a drawback of an existing approach for this problem that produce large time intervals over which temporal subgraphs are defined. We propose a problem to deal with this issue and we design (1) an exact algorithm based on dynamic programming which solves the problem in polynomial time and (2) a heuristic, based on a segmentation of the time domain and the computation of a refinement. The experimental results we present on seven protein-protein interaction networks show that in many cases our heuristic is able to reduce the time intervals with respect to those computed by the existing methods.}

	abstract = {Third-generation nanopore sequencing technologies, along with portable devices such as MinION Nanopore and Jetson Xavier NX, allow performing cost-effective metagenomic analysis in a portable manner. At the same time, we observe the growth of the serverless computing paradigm that offers high scalability with limited maintenance overhead for the underlying infrastructure. Recent advancements in serverless offerings make it a viable choice for performing operations such as basecalling. This paper aims to evaluate if a combination of edge and serverless computing paradigms can be successfully used to perform the basecalling process, with the focus on acceleration of offline edge-based processing with serverless-based infrastructure. For the purposes of the experiments, we proposed a workflow in which DNA sequence reads are processed simultaneously at the edge with Jetson Xavier NX and in the cloud with AWS Lambda in different network conditions. The results of our experiments show that with such a hybrid approach, we can reduce the processing time and energy consumption of the basecalling process compared to fully offline or fully online processing. We also believe that while so far, the adoption of serverless computing for bioinformatic applications is not high, the recent improvements to platforms such as AWS Lambda make it a compelling choice for an increasing number of bioinformatics workflows.\n}

	abstract = {The article presents a comparison of two statistical approaches to the problem of image reconstruction from projections: the worldwide known concept based on a discrete-to-discrete data model and our original idea based on a continuous-to-continuous data model. Both reconstruction approaches are formulated taking into account the statistical properties of signals obtained by CT scanners. The main goal of this strategy is significantly improving the quality of the reconstructed images, so allowing a reduction in the x-ray dose absorbed by a patient during CT examinations. In the concept proposed by us, the reconstruction problem is formulated as a shift-invariant system. In consequence, that significantly improves the quality of the subsequently reconstructed images, and it allows to reduce the computational complexity compared to the reference method. The performed by us experiments have shown that our original reconstruction method outperforms the referential approach regarding the image quality obtained and the time of necessary calculations.}

	abstract = {One of the most important issues in the context of contemporary research on a human body biomechanics is musculoskeletal models. It turns out that the need for biomechanically correct movement model is enormous not only in medicine and rehabilitation, but also in animations synthesis with computer game engines, where unsightly effects often occur between animation keys. Proposing a musculoskeletal model that could be efficiently adapted to a game development environment would speed up work and solve the difficulties in controlling movement sequence synthesis. The proposed model, using dynamic inversion simulation, includes Usik’s equations which have been added to the 6DoF skeletal module. Usik uses the thermomechanics of a continuous medium, which takes into account the cross-effects of mechanical, electrical, chemical and thermodynamic phenomena in muscle tissue which makes it possible to better (closer to the nature) describe the reaction of muscles during movement. The validation value of the model correctness is the GRF (ground reaction force) where the simulated values are compared to the measured one. This work concerns human gait and is the basis for further development in the context of the identified problem in the field of computer game engines. Due to the more accurate GRF results against existing solutions, the proposed one is optimistic for further work on it.}

	abstract = {Cancer is a worldwide health problem. The fatality rate of some types of cancer motivates the scientific community to improve the standard techniques used to fight against this disease, as well as to investigate new forms of treatments. One of these emerging treatments is hyperthermia using the injection of magnetic nanoparticles into the tumour area. Its basic idea is to heat the target tumour tissue leading to its necrosis. This study simulates the bioheat processes using Pennes’ model to evaluate the tissue damage in silico. Furthermore, the differential evolution optimisation technique is applied to suggest the optimal location of injection considering the minimisation of damage to the healthy tissue and the maximisation of the tumour necrosis. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is a promising tool for aiding hyperthermia-based treatment planning.}

	abstract = {Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure (PNES) represents a neurological disorder often diagnosed and pharmacologically treated as epilepsy. PNES subjects show the same symptoms as epileptic patients but do not have an EEG characterized by ictal patterns during psychogenic seizures. Diagnosis requires an EEG video, but this methodology is very time-consuming and dispensable in both time and cost. Our paper aims to define a novel methodology to support the clinical diagnosis of PNES by analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals obtained in resting conditions. In this case, it is unnecessary to induce seizures in the subjects. A software pipeline was implemented based on robust feature extraction methods used in quantitative EEG analysis in the clinical setting, integrating them with machine learning classifiers. Unlike other similar works, the methodology was tested on a large dataset consisting of 225 EEGs (75 healthy, 75 PNES and 75 subjects with epilepsy), showing that it has a classification accuracy greater than 85%.}

	abstract = {Fetal Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm caused by a problem in the fetus's heart's electrical system. Monitoring fetal ECG is vital to delivering useful information regarding the fetus's condition. Acute fetal arrhythmia may result in cardiac failure or death. Thus the early detection of fetal arrhythmia is important. Current approaches use several electrodes to acquire abdomen ECG from the mother, which causes discomfort. Moreover, ECG signals acquired are extremely noisy and have artifacts from breathing and muscle contraction, which hardens ECG extraction. In this study, a machine learning framework for fetal arrhythmia detection. The proposed framework uses only a single abdomen ECG. It employs multiple filtering techniques to remove noise and artifacts. It also extracts 16 significant features from multiple domains, including (time, frequency, and time-frequency features. Finally, it utilizes four machine learning classifiers to detect arrhythmia. The highest accuracy of 93.12% is achieved using Boosted decision tree classifier. The performance of the proposed method shows its competing ability compared to other methods.\n}

	abstract = {Bi-clustering is an unsupervised data mining technique, which involves concurrent clustering of rows and columns of a two-dimensional data matrix. It has been demonstrated that bi-clustering may allow accurate and comprehensive mining of information, important for many practical applications. Numerous algorithms for data bi-clustering were proposed in the literature, based on different approaches and leading, in general, to different outputs. In this paper we propose a consensus method for combining outputs of many bi-clustering algorithms for improved quality of predictions. The proposed algorithm includes two steps. The first step, “assignment”, leads to detecting groups of bi-clusters of high similarity and the second step, “trimming”, results in transforming a group of similar bi-clusters into one bi-cluster of high quality. We demonstrate, on the basis of both simulated and real datasets, that using our algorithm highly improves quality of bi-clustering. We also provide an easy to use software tool, which includes implementations of several bi-clustering algorithms and our consensus method.}

	abstract = {Mining imbalanced datasets is a challenging and difficult problem. In this paper we adress it by proposing GEP-NB classifier based on the oversampling technique. It combines two learning methods - Gene Expression Programming and Naïve Bayes, which cooperate to produce a final prediction. At the pre-processing stage a simple mechanism for generating synthetic minority class examples and balancing the training set is used. Next, two genes g1 and g2 are evolved using Gene Expression Programming. They differ by applying in each case a different procedure for selecting synthetic minority class examples. If the class prediction by g1 agrees with the class prediction made by g2, their decision is final. Otherwise the final predictive decision is taken by the Naïve Bayes classifier. The approach is validated in an extensive computational experiment. Results produced by GEP-NB are compared with performance of several state-of-the-art classifiers. Comparisons show that GEP-NB offers a competitive performance.}

This paper describes WECOI and presents the alternative approach for over-sampling, which is based on a selection of reference instances from produced clusters. This approach is flexible on applied clustering methods; however, the similarity-based clustering algorithm has been proposed as a core. For clustering, different methods may also be applied. The proposed approach has been validated experimentally using different clustering methods and shows how the clustering technique may influence synthetic instance generation and the performance of WECOI. The WECOI approach has also been compared with other algorithms dedicated to learning from imbalanced data streams. The computational experiment was carried out using several selected benchmark datasets. The computational experiment results are presented and discussed.\n}

There exist several types of agents which differ in their way of behavior related to their own strategy when they interact with neighbors. We assume that interaction between agents is governed by a spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Each agent participates in several games with his neighbors and his goal is to maximize his payoff using own strategy. Agents can change their strategies in time by replacing their own strategy with a more profitable one from its neighborhood. While agents act in such a way to maximize their incomes we study conditions of emerging collective behavior in such systems measured by the average total payoff of agents in the game or by an equivalent measure–the total number of cooperating players. These measures are the external criteria of the game, and players acting selfishly are not aware of them. We show experimentally that collective behavior in such systems can emerge if some conditions related to the game are fulfilled. We propose to introduce an income-sharing mechanism to the game, giving a possibility to share incomes locally by agents. We present the results of an experimental study showing that the sharing mechanism is a distributed optimization algorithm that significantly improves the capabilities of emerging collective behavior measured by the external criterion of the game.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we extend our previous modular model of a social collective with hierarchical knowledge structure, and we propose an additional step in tuning information retrieval systems after dataset experiments and before testing them with real users. For this purpose, we add a simulation of the group of users as a social collective model and run the information retrieval system on it. Here, we take first steps in that direction, by focusing on a subsystem of a recommender system and simulating what type of social collective it is most effective with. We present details on the social collective model and the information retrieval subsystem model, as well as how to put them together in one simulation. We run several experiments and present some initial findings. In our opinion, this overall approach could be used to greatly enhance further tests with real users.}

	abstract = {As social networks continue to grow in popularity, it is essential to understand what can be learned about private attributes of social-network users by mining social-network data. Previous work focused on the inference of time-invariant attributes such as personality traits. By contrast, in this paper we focus on the inference of dynamic, time-varying attributes. We present a new approach to modeling social-network users and mining time-varying attributes using dynamic bayesian networks (DBNs). We then explore the extent to which such temporal models can improve the inference results of various dynamic attributes. This work is the first to take a DBN-based approach to the task of private-attribute inference in social networks.}

	abstract = {The widely addressed topic of ontology alignment to this day contains several open research questions that remain either unanswered or only vaguely tackled. One of them is designating alignments of concept instances, which according to the literature are addressed in a handful of publications. Therefore, in this paper we propose a formal framework based on fuzzy logic that can be used to determine such mappings. We provide several similarity functions and a set of inference rules for combining them. The approach has been experimentally verified using widely accepted datasets provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, yielding promising results.}

They combine deep neural networks – transformers and recurrent neural networks – with external knowledge bases. We show that for simple models, adding information from knowledge bases significantly improves the quality of sentiment prediction in most cases. For medium-sized sets, we obtain significant improvements over state-of-the-art transformer-based models using our proposed methods: Tailored KEPLER and Token Extension. We show that the cases with the improvement belong to the hard-to-learn set.}

	abstract = {Sentiments expressed in opinions on social networks have played an increasingly significant impact in solving various social problems. Improving the effectiveness of sentiment analysis methods on social networks is still of interest to several scientists. A notable and robust development direction is sentiment analysis methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). This paper introduces a model called contextual-based GCN for sentence-level sentiment analysis by considering the following steps: (i) Sentences are converted into contextualized word representation vectors based on the combination of the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model and bidirectional long short-term memory. (ii) The contextualized word representations are used to construct a sentence graph as a feature of nodes. (iii) A GCN model with two convolutional layers was used to learn the structure-aware node representations on the sentence graph. (iv) The softmax classifier was used for the sentence-level sentiment analysis. Experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that, unlike other methods, the proposed method can extract more context information from the opinions to obtain a better representation of the graph structure and learn better structure-aware nodes represented on the graph. The proposed method has improved the performance in terms of accuracy of the conventional methods from 2.2 to 3.2% points.}

	abstract = {Ethereum is a decentralized public blockchain powered by its native cryptocurrency, the Ether (\\(\\varXi \\)), which is second to Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization. To ensure the integrity of the network, Ethereum requires a fee for every transaction. This fee is called gas (by analogy to the fuel used by cars) and can fluctuate based on supply and demand. This volatility stepped up a number of initiatives to predict future gas prices. The paper proposes a novel solution beyond current state-of-art using DeepAR. This is a model built on Recurrent Neural Networks with the ability leverage hundreds of related time series to produce more accurate predictions. Our implementation uses features extracted from the Ethereum MainNet as well as off-chain data to achieve accurate predictions.\n}
