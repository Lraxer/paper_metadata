	abstract = {We have been using various environments and spaces to meet high transportation demands. However, traffic congestion, deteriorating transportation infrastructure, and environmental pollution have become current social problems. To solve these problems, flying vehicles that use near ground space (NGS) are attracting attention. In order to develop such vehicles efficiently, highly accurate computer simulation technology is required. In this study, computer simulations are performed by coupling fluid and rigid body motions using two calculation methods. One is the moving computational domain method, in which the object and computational domain are moved as a single unit to represent the motion of the object and the flow around the body, and the other is the multi-axis sliding mesh method, in which physical quantities are transferred at the boundaries to reproduce the motion of objects with different motions, such as rotating parts. Because the flying car in the development stage is small and has a shape that obtains thrust from multiple propellers, the insertion of disturbances was considered because of the possible effects of wind on the aircraft during actual flight. In this study, we attempted to clarify the effect of wind on the flying car by performing flight simulations in six patterns, one with no wind and the other with a disturbance inserted that causes a headwind during forward flight and a crosswind during turning flight.}

	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising application of deep neural networks for the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been observed that standard PINNs may not be able to accurately fit all types of PDEs, leading to poor predictions for specific regions in the domain. A common solution is to partition the domain by time and train each time interval separately. However, this approach leads to the prediction errors being accumulated over time, which is especially the case when solving “stiff” PDEs. To address these issues, we propose a new PINN training scheme, called DP-PINN (Dual-Phase PINN). DP-PINN divides the training into two phases based on a carefully chosen time point \\(t_s\\). The phase-1 training aims to generate the accurate solution at \\(t_s\\), which will serve as the additional intermediate condition for the phase-2 training. New sampling strategies are also proposed to enhance the training process. These design considerations improve the prediction accuracy significantly. We have conducted the experiments to evaluate DP-PINN with both “stiff” and non-stiff PDEs. The results show that the solutions predicted by DP-PINN exhibit significantly higher accuracy compared to those obtained by the state-of-the-art PINNs in literature.}

	abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) exemplify systems where simple local interaction rules can lead to intricate and complex emergent phenomena at large scales. The various types of dynamical behavior of CA are usually categorized empirically into Wolfram’s complexity classes. Here, we propose a quantitative measure, rooted in quantum information theory, to categorize the complexity of classical deterministic cellular automata. Specifically, we construct a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) of the transition matrix on the space of all possible CA configurations. We find that the growth of entropy of the singular value spectrum of the MPO reveals the complexity of the CA and can be used to characterize its dynamical behavior. This measure defines the concept of operator entanglement entropy for CA, demonstrating that quantum information measures can be meaningfully applied to classical deterministic systems.}

	abstract = {Virtual planning tools that provide intuitive user interaction and immediate hemodynamic feedback are crucial for cardiologists to effectively treat coronary artery disease. Current FDA-approved tools for coronary intervention planning require days of preliminary processing and rely on conventional 2D displays for hemodynamic evaluation. Immersion offered by extended reality (XR) has been found to benefit intervention planning over traditional 2D displays. To bridge these gaps, we introduce HarVI, a coronary intervention planner that leverages machine learning for real-time hemodynamic analysis and extended reality for intuitive 3D user interaction. The framework uses a predefined set of 1D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to perform one-shot training for our machine learning-based blood flow model. In a cohort of 50 patients, we calculated fractional flow reserve (FFR), the gold standard biomarker of ischemia in coronary disease, using HarVI (\\(FFR_{HarVI}\\)) and 1D CFD models (\\(FFR_{1D}\\)). HarVI was shown to almost perfectly recapitulate the results of 1D CFD simulations through continuous and categorical validation scores. In this study, we establish a machine learning-based process for virtual coronary treatment planning with an average turnaround time of just 74\xa0min, thus reducing the required time for one-shot training to less than a working day.}

	abstract = {Interior point methods are widely used for different types of mathematical optimization problems. Many implementations of interior point methods in use today rely on direct linear solvers to solve systems of equations in each iteration. The need to solve ever larger optimization problems more efficiently and the rise of hardware accelerators for general purpose computing has led to a large interest in using iterative linear solvers instead, with the major issue being inevitable ill-conditioning of the linear systems arising as the optimization progresses. We investigate the use of Krylov solvers for interior point methods in solving optimization problems from radiation therapy and support vector machines. We implement a prototype interior point method using a so called doubly augmented formulation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker linear system of equations, originally proposed by Forsgren and Gill, and evaluate its performance on real optimization problems from radiation therapy and support vector machines. Crucially, our implementation uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient method with Jacobi preconditioning internally. Our measurements of the conditioning of the linear systems indicate that the Jacobi preconditioner improves the conditioning of the systems to a degree that they can be solved iteratively, but there is room for further improvement in that regard. Furthermore, profiling of our prototype code shows that it is suitable for GPU acceleration, which may further improve its performance in practice. Overall, our results indicate that our method can find solutions of acceptable accuracy in reasonable time, even with a simple Jacobi preconditioner.}

	abstract = {In response to the growing threat of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) in network security, our research introduces an innovative APT malware attribution tool, the APTMalKG knowledge graph. This knowledge graph is constructed from comprehensive APT malware data and refined through a multi-stage graph clustering process. We have incorporated domain-specific meta-paths into the GraphSAGE graph embedding algorithm to enhance its effectiveness. Our approach includes an ontology model capturing complex APT malware characteristics and behaviors, extracted from sandbox analysis reports and expanded intelligence. To manage the graph’s granularity and scale, we categorize nodes based on domain knowledge, form a correlation subgraph, and progressively adjust similarity thresholds and edge weights. The refined graph maintains crucial attribution data while reducing complexity. By integrating domain-specific meta-paths into GraphSAGE, we achieve improved APT attribution accuracy with an average accuracy of 91.16%, an F1 score of 89.82%, and an average AUC of 98.99%, enhancing performance significantly. This study benefits network security analysts with an intuitive knowledge graph and explores large-scale graph computing methods for practical scenarios, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on APT malware analysis and attribution research, highlighting the value of knowledge graphs in network security.}

	abstract = {While the unstable turbulence condition known as Vortex Ring State in rotorcraft has been studied mainly in helicopters, there have not been many studies of drones, which have become more active in recent years. In particular, there are few studies using numerical simulations focusing on small diameter rotors such as quadcopters. In this paper, descent simulations are performed using a rotor model with a diameter of 8 inches and a propeller pitch of 4.5 inches, which is used for quadcopters. In this study, Moving Computational Domain method is used to reproduce the descent motion of the rotor over the entire moving computational domain. In addition, Sliding mesh method is applied to reproduce the rotor rotation within the computational grid. This method allows flow field analysis under free rigid body motion of the analytical model. The displacement of the computational domain itself is applied at each step to reproduce the descent conditions. By combining these methods, fluid flow simulations under vertical descent and conditions are performed to visualize the flow field. Flow field evaluation using the Q criterion showed that even in a small rotor, circulating vortices are generated at a velocity close to the induced velocity \\({v}_{h}\\). VRS was also observed around the rotor under the conditions of horizontal speed \\(V_H \\; = \\;2.0v_h ,\\; descent\\;speed\\; V_Y \\, = \\,1.0v_h\\), and descent angle of 26.6°, but at the same time vortex divergence was also observed. It was inferred that the forward velocity component helps to avoid Vortex Ring State.}

	abstract = {We present a new approach for real-time retrieval and classification of solar images using a proposed sector-based image hashing technique. To this end, we generate intermediate hand-crafted features from automatically detected active regions in the form of layer-sector-based descriptors. Additionally, we employ a small fully-connected autoencoder to encode and finally obtain the concise Layer-Sector Solar Hash. By reducing the amount of data required to describe the Sun images, we achieve almost real-time retrieval speed of similar images to the query image. Since solar AIA images are not labeled, for the purposes of the presented test experiments, we consider images produced within a short time frame (typically up to several hours) to be similar. This approach has several potential applications, including searching, classifying, and retrieving solar flares, which are of critical importance for many aspects of life on Earth.}

	abstract = {Monitoring disease development in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, is crucial and can be assessed via hemodynamic metrics. While these metrics are known to depend on the inlet velocity, the effects of changes in the time-dependent inlet flow profile are not understood. In this study, we seek to quantify the effects of modulating temporal arterial waveforms to understand the effects of hemodynamic metrics. We expand on previous work that identified the minimum number of points of interest needed to characterize a left coronary artery inlet waveform. We vary these points of interest and quantify the effects on commonly used hemodynamic metrics such as wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, and relative residence time. To simulate we use 1D Navier-Stokes and 3D lattice Boltzmann simulation approaches conducted on high performance compute clusters. The results allow us to observe which parts of the waveform are most susceptible to perturbations, and therefore also to measurement error. The impacts of this work include clinical insight as to which portions of velocity waveforms are most susceptible to measurement error, the construction of a method that can be applied to other fluid simulations with pulsatile inlet conditions, and the ability to distinguish the vital parts of a pulsatile inlet condition for computational fluid dynamic simulations.}

	abstract = {One of the consequences of climate change is the increase in forest fires around the world. In order to act quickly when this type of natural disaster occurs, it is important to have simulation tools that allow a better approximation of the evolution of the fire, especially in Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas. Most forest fire propagation simulators tend to represent the perimeter of the fire in a polygonal way, which often does not allow us to capture the real evolution of the fire in complex environments, both at the terrain and vegetation levels. In this work, we focus on Elliptical Wave Propagation (EWP) based simulators, which represent the perimeter of the fire with a set of points connected to each other by straight lines. When the perimeter grows and new points must be added, the interpolation method used is linear interpolation. This system generates unrealistic shapes of fires. In this work, an interpolation method leveraging Composite Bézier Curves (CBC) is proposed to generate fire evolution shapes in a more realistic way. The proposed method has been incorporated into FARSITE, a well-known EWP-based forest fire spread simulator. Both interpolation methods have been applied to ideal scenarios and a real case. The results show that the proposed interpolation method (CBC) is capable of generating more realistic fire shapes and, in addition, enables the simulator the ability to better simulate the spread of fire in WUI zones.}

	abstract = {We propose a single-rate method for geometry compression of triangle meshes based on using a neural predictor to predict the encoded vertex positions using connectivity and an already known part of the geometry. The method is based on standard traversal-based methods but uses a neural predictor for prediction instead of a hand-crafted prediction scheme. The parameters of the neural predictor are learned on a dataset of existing triangle meshes. The method additionally includes an estimate of the prediction uncertainty, which is used to guide the encoding traversal of the mesh. The results of the proposed method are compared with a benchmark method on the ABC dataset using both mechanistic and perceptual metrics.}

	abstract = {Pre-trained language models encounter a bottleneck in production due to their high computational cost. Model compression methods have emerged as critical technologies for overcoming this bottleneck. As a popular compression method, knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large (teacher) model to a small (student) one. However, existing methods perform distillation on the entire data, which easily leads to repetitive learning for the student. Furthermore, the capacity gap between the teacher and student hinders knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose the Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (DeKD) with teacher assistant-based dynamic objective alignment, which empowers the student to dynamically adjust the learning process. Specifically, we first design an entropy-based strategy to select informative instances at the data level, which can reduce the learning from the mastered instances for the student. Next, we introduce the teacher assistant as an auxiliary model for the student at the model level to mitigate the degradation of distillation performance. Finally, we further develop the mechanism of dynamically aligning intermediate representations of the teacher to ensure effective knowledge transfer at the objective level. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the predominant and most extensively utilized programming model in the High Performance Computing (HPC) area. The standard only provides bindings for the low-level programming languages C, C++, and Fortran. While efforts are being made to offer MPI bindings for other programming languages, the support provided may be limited, potentially resulting in functionality gaps, performance overhead, and compatibility problems. To deal with those issues, we introduce MPI4All, a novel tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating efficient MPI bindings for any programming language. MPI4All is not dependent on the MPI implementation, and adding support for new languages does not require significant effort. The current version of MPI4All includes binding generators for Java and Go programming languages. We demonstrate their good performance with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {As the quest for more sustainable and environmentally friendly materials has increased in the last decades, cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), abundant in nature, have proven their capabilities as building blocks to create strong and stiff filaments. Experiments have been conducted to characterize CNFs with a rheo-optical flow-stop technique to study the Brownian dynamics through the CNFs’ birefringence decay after stop. This paper aims to predict the initial relaxation of birefringence using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By reducing the dimensionality of the data frame features, we can plot the principal components (PCs) that retain most of the information and treat them as time series. We employ LSTM by training with the data before the flow stops and predicting the behavior afterward. Consequently, we reconstruct the data frames from the obtained predictions and compare them to the original data.}

	abstract = {Satellite computing system (SCS), with its huge economic value, is suffering from increasing attacks. Moving Target Defense (MTD) can create the asymmetric situation between attacks and defenses by changing the attack surface. As SCS’s limited defense resources, current MTD defense timing selection methods are not suitable for SCS. This paper proposes a Markov Game based Defense Timing Selection (MGDTS) approach for MTD in SCS. MGDTS formulates attack-defense adversarial relationship as a Markov game with incomplete information, and explicit costs are used to define the resource consumption of a defender. For defense timing decision, MGDTS uses a Markov decision process to construct the defense timing decision equation, and a real-time dynamic programming to solve the equation. Experimental results show that compared with other MTDs, MGDTS can improve the security of MTD while reducing its costs.}

	abstract = {The development of Cloud-Fog-Edge computing infrastructures in response to the rapid advance of IoT technologies requires applications to be positioned closer to users at the edge of the network. Characterised by a geographically distributed configuration with numerous heterogeneous nodes, these infrastructures face challenges such as node failures, mobility constraints, resource limitations and network congestion. To address these issues, the adoption of microservices-based application architectures has been encouraged. However, the interdependencies and function calls between services require careful optimisation, as each has unique resource requirements. In this paper, we propose a new model and heuristic for the placement of microservices in the Cloud-Fog-Edge continuum, based on community detection and a greedy algorithm to optimise energy use while taking into account the resource constraints and ensuring that response time is acceptable. This method aims to reduce energy consumption and network load, thereby improving the efficiency and sustainability of the infrastructure. Results have been compared with different scenarios and show that our approach can significantly reduce energy consumption and make efficient use of resources.}

This paper presents flexible high-performance algorithms that compute the tensor-matrix product according to the Loops-over-GEMM (LoG) approach. Our algorithms can process dense tensors with any linear tensor layout, arbitrary tensor order and dimensions all of which can be runtime variable. We discuss different tensor slicing methods with parallelization strategies and propose six algorithm versions that call BLAS with subtensors or tensor slices. Their performance is quantified on a set of tensors with various shapes and tensor orders. Our best performing version attains a median performance of 1.37 double precision Tflops on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R processor using Intel’s MKL. We show that the tensor layout does not affect the performance significantly. Our fastest implementation is on average at least 14.05% and up to 3.79x faster than other state-of-the-art approaches and actively developed libraries like Libtorch and Eigen.\n\n}

It is based on reducing the measurement of discrepancy between multidimensional feature distributions to one-dimensional interpoint comparisons. Our method provides a general tool for deriving a wide range of evaluation measures. The Cramér Interpoint Inception Distance (CIID) is notable for its theoretical properties, including a Gaussian-free structure of feature distribution and a strongly consistent estimator with unbiased gradients. Our experiments, conducted on both synthetic and large-scale real or generated data, suggest that CIID is a promising competitor to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which is currently the primary metric for evaluating deep generative models.\n}

	abstract = {We define the EC (Elliptic Curve)-based factorization witnesses and prove related results within both conditional and unconditional approaches. We present experimental computations that support the conjecture of behavior of related admissible elliptic curves in relation to the deterministic complexity of suitable factoring algorithms based on the parameters of the witnesses. This paper features three main results devoted to the factorization of RSA numbers \\(N = pq\\), where \\(q>p\\). The first result of computational complexity of elliptic curve factorization is improved by the factor \\(D^{\\sigma }\\), comparing to previously known result \\(O\\left( D^{2+o(1)}\\right) \\), where D is smoothness bound, assuming additional knowledge of the admissible elliptic curve. The second result demonstrates the feasibility of achieving factorization in deterministic, polynomial time, based on knowledge obtained at a specific step in the elliptic curve method (ECM), a feat previously considered impossible. The third result establishes deterministic time for conditional factorization using the elliptic version of Fermat method. It has the magnitude order \\((\\log N)^ {O(1)}\\left( 1+\\left( \\frac{|a_p|+|a_q|}{D}\\right) ^{2}\\right) \\), provided \\(\\frac{q}{p} \\ll 1\\). Here \\(a_p,a_q\\) are the Frobenius traces of the corresponding curves (\\(E(\\mathbb {F}_{p}), E(\\mathbb {F}_{q})\\)), and D indicates the approximation of the quotient p/q by the quotient \\(a_p/a_q\\), assuming that the order of the group of points over a pseudo elliptic curve \\(E(\\mathbb {Z}_{N})\\) is known.}

	abstract = {Three-dimensional point clouds play a fundamental role in a wide array of fields, spanning from computer vision to robotics and autonomous navigation. Modeling the 3D shape of objects from these point clouds is important for various applications, including 3D shape completion and object recognition. This paper presents a complex-valued product-unit network for data-driven 3D shape completion. Using product units, sparse superpositions of complex power laws, including sparse polynomial functions, are fitted to incomplete 3D point clouds and used for extrapolating the data in the 3D space. In computer-vision applications, this task occurs frequently, e.g., when only partial views are available or occlusions hinder the acquisition of the full point cloud. We conduct a comparative analysis with a standard neural network to emphasize the superior extrapolation capabilities of product-unit networks within the 3D space. Furthermore, we present a real-world task that serves as a tangible demonstration of the proposed method’s utility in the context of completing incomplete point cloud data acquired with a 3D scanner. This research contributes new insights into the field of neural network applications for 3D point cloud processing, revealing the broad potential of product-unit networks in this domain.}

	abstract = {On the path toward developing the first fusion energy devices, plasma simulations have become indispensable tools for supporting the design and development of fusion machines. Among these critical simulation tools, BIT1 is an advanced Particle-in-Cell code with Monte Carlo collisions, specifically designed for modeling plasma-material interaction and, in particular, analyzing the power load distribution on tokamak divertors. The current implementation of BIT1 relies exclusively on MPI for parallel communication and lacks support for GPUs. In this work, we address these limitations by designing and implementing a hybrid, shared-memory version of BIT1 capable of utilizing GPUs. For shared-memory parallelization, we rely on OpenMP and OpenACC, using a task-based approach to mitigate load-imbalance issues in the particle mover. On an HPE Cray EX computing node, we observe an initial performance improvement of approximately 42%, with scalable performance showing an enhancement of about 38% when using 8 MPI ranks. Still relying on OpenMP and OpenACC, we introduce the first version of BIT1 capable of using GPUs. We investigate two different data movement strategies: unified memory and explicit data movement. Overall, we report BIT1 data transfer findings during each PIC cycle. Among BIT1 GPU implementations, we demonstrate performance improvement through concurrent GPU utilization, especially when MPI ranks are assigned to dedicated GPUs. Finally, we analyze the performance of the first BIT1 GPU porting with the NVIDIA Nsight tools to further our understanding of BIT1’s computational efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations, capable of exploiting current supercomputer infrastructures.}

	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations\xa0(PDEs) in various scientific and engineering domains. However, traditional PINN architectures typically rely on large, fully connected multilayer perceptrons\xa0(MLPs), lacking the sparsity and modularity inherent in many traditional numerical solvers. An unsolved and critical question for PINN is: What is the minimum PINN complexity regarding nodes, layers, and connections needed to provide acceptable performance? To address this question, this study investigates a novel approach by merging established PINN methodologies with brain-inspired neural network techniques. We use Brain-Inspired Modular Training\xa0(BIMT), leveraging concepts such as locality, sparsity, and modularity inspired by the organization of the brain. With brain-inspired PINN, we demonstrate the evolution of PINN architectures from large, fully connected structures to bare-minimum, compact MLP architectures, often consisting of a few neural units! Moreover, using brain-inspired PINN, we showcase the spectral bias phenomenon occurring on the PINN architectures: bare-minimum architectures solving problems with high-frequency components require more neural units than PINN solving low-frequency problems. Finally, we derive basic PINN building blocks through BIMT training on simple problems akin to convolutional and attention modules in deep neural networks, enabling the construction of modular PINN architectures. Our experiments show that brain-inspired PINN training leads to PINN architectures that minimize the computing and memory resources yet provide accurate results.}

	abstract = {Traditional 3D face models are based on mesh representations with texture. One of the most important models is Flame (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions), which produces meshes of human faces that are fully controllable. Unfortunately, such models have problems with capturing geometric and appearance details. In contrast to mesh representation, the neural radiance field (NeRF) produces extremely sharp renders. However, implicit methods are hard to animate and do not generalize well to unseen expressions. It is not trivial to effectively control NeRF models to obtain face manipulation. The present paper proposes a novel approach, named NeRFlame, which combines the strengths of both NeRF and Flame methods. Our method enables NeRF to have high-quality rendering capabilities while offering complete control over the visual appearance, similar to Flame. In contrast to traditional NeRF-based structures that use neural networks for RGB color and volume density modeling, our approach utilizes the Flame mesh as a distinct density volume. Consequently, color values exist only in the vicinity of the Flame mesh. Our model’s core concept involves adjusting the volume density based on its proximity to the mesh. This Flame framework is seamlessly incorporated into the NeRF architecture for predicting RGB colors, enabling our model to represent volume density explicitly and implicitly capture RGB colors.\n}

	abstract = {The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A\xa0standard approach assumes a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A\xa0conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal model architecture. In this paper, we present a new method that realizes just that. We show how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The solution utilizes a Stochastic Gradient Descent-based optimizer developed from scratch to realize the task of network architecture modification. The paper is accompanied with a Python source code of the prepared method. The proposed approach was tested in visual pattern classification problems and yielded highly satisfying results.}
