	abstract = {We describe protocol features to provide both Identity Privacy and Location Privacy at the network layer that are truly end-to-end, strengthening the trust model by constraining the boundary of trust to only the communicating parties. We show that Identity Privacy and Location Privacy can be provided by changing only the addressing model, whilst still remaining compatible with IPv6. Using the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP), it is possible to use ephemeral end-system ILNP Node Identity (NID) values to improve identity privacy. Using the ILNP Locator values with dynamic bindings, it is possible to use multiple IPv6 routing prefixes as network Locator (L64) values to provide (topological) location privacy. This is achieved: (a) whilst maintaining end-to-end state for transport protocols, without proxies, tunnels, or gateways at the transport layer or application layer; and (b) without the use of cryptographic techniques, so performance is not impacted.}

	abstract = {The main iteration goal of transport protocols is to optimize the performance of specific modules. In this poster, we propose a framework named EasyTrans, that enables fast iteration of transport protocol modules. With EasyTrans, developers can focus on the modules they want to iterate and no longer need to deal with other unnecessary parts of the transport protocol. Through different module calling modes, EasyTrans enables high performance even if the modules use algorithms that require sophisticated computation such as machine learning. We implement EasyTrans based on QUIC. Evaluation results show that the overhead of EasyTrans is slight.}

	abstract = {Data center workload fluctuations need periodic, but careful scheduling to minimize power consumption while meeting the task completion time requirements. Existing data center scheduling systems tightly pack containers to save power. However, with the growth of multi-tiered applications, there is a significant need to account for the affinity between application components, to minimize communication overheads and latency. Centralized container scheduling systems using graph partitioning algorithms cause a significant number of task migrations, with associated downtime.We design pMACH, a novel distributed container scheduling scheme for optimizing both power and task completion time in data centers. It minimizes task migrations and packs frequently communicating containers together without overloading servers. pMACH operates at peak energy efficiency, thus reducing energy consumption while also providing greater headroom for unpredictable workload spikes. We also propose in-network monitoring using smartNICs (sNIC) to measure the communications and then perform scheduling in a hierarchical, parallelized framework to achieve high performance and scalability. pMACH is based on incremental partitioning and it leverages the previous scheduling decision to significantly reduce the number of containers moved between servers, avoiding application downtime.Both testbed measurements and large-scale trace-driven simulations show that pMACH saves at least 13.44% more power compared to previous scheduling systems. It speeds task completion, reducing the 95th percentile by a factor of 1.76-2.11 compared to existing container scheduling schemes. Compared to other static graph-based approaches, our incremental partitioning technique reduces migrations per epoch by 82%.}

	abstract = {Most congestion control mechanisms are designed for specific network environments. Hence, there is no known algorithm that achieves uniformly good performance in all scenarios for all flows. Rather than devising such a one-size-fits-all algorithm, we propose a system to dynamically switch between the most suitable congestion control mechanisms for specific flows in specific environments. This raises a number of challenges, which we address through the design and implementation of Antelope, a system that can dynamically reconfigure to use the most suitable congestion control mechanism for an individual flow. We build a machine learning approach to learn which algorithm works best for individual conditions and implement kernel-level support for dynamically adjusting congestion control algorithms. We have implemented Antelope in Linux, and evaluated it in both emulated and production networks. We show that in WAN, DCN, and cellular networks, Antelope achieves an average 16% improvement in throughput compared with BBR; compared with Cubic, Antelope achieves an average 19% improvement in throughput and 10% reduction in delay.}

STIP addresses managed network use-cases including enterprise network authentication and authorization, and ISP use-cases, including trust based routing, and application aware networking. It can provide an enabling infrastructure that improves resilience to the painful BGP hijacking and distributed denial of service attacks.At the data plane, STIP consists of a trusted forwarding engine, that uses authenticated trust extensions to process traffic reliably. At the control and management plane STIP divides the network into trust domains that evaluate trustworthiness of devices in the domain, and distribute it securely using transitive trust. Our vision is Internet-wide STIP deployment . We present a migration process based on trust domains that can be used to gradually upgrade current IP networks to STIP.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed rapid adoption of low-power Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks (WSANs) in process industries. To meet the critical demand for reliable and real-time communication in harsh industrial environments, the industrial WSAN standards, such as WirelessHART, ISA100, WIA-FA, and 6TiSCH, make a set of specific design choices, such as employing the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) technique. Such design choices distinguish industrial WSANs from traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which were designed for best-effort services. Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing new methods to enable autonomous transmission scheduling for industrial WSANs that run TSCH and the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Our study shows that the current approaches fail to consider the traffic loads of different devices when assigning time slots and channels, which significantly compromises network performance when facing high data rates. In this paper, we introduce ATRIA, a novel Autonomous Traffic-Aware transmission scheduling method for industrial WSANs. The device that runs ATRIA can detect its traffic load based on its local routing information and then schedule its transmissions accordingly without the need to exchange information with neighboring devices. Experimental results show that ATRIA provides significantly higher end-to-end network reliability and lower end-to-end latency without introducing additional overhead compared with a state-of-the-art baseline.}

	abstract = {Billions of IoT devices are connected to networks all around us, enabling cyber-physical systems. These devices can carry and generate user-sensitive data, examples of such devices are smartwatches, medical equipment, and smart home gadgets. Individual IoT devices have some form of intrusion detection system integrated, but once they are all connected, a network threat to one device could mean a threat to many. IoT devices must have a robust intrusion detection system that would keep devices secure over a network. To aid with this, we provide a machine learning solution that adheres to Global Data Protection Regulation by keeping the user data secure locally on the IoT device itself. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) approach that capitalizes on a decentralized and collaborative way of training machine learning models. In this study, we practice federated learning technique to train and create a robust intrusion detection model for the security of IoT devices. We evaluate our proposed approach using three different use-cases to show the security enhancements that improve using the FL technique, resulting in a more reliable performance in this domain.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems, there is an increasingly strong demand for low-latency and high-bandwidth vehicular services, such as automatic driving assistance, emergency alarm, and infotainment. However, in some cases (e.g., traffic congestion, remote areas), the ground communication networks alone cannot meet the vast needs of vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible and deployable, which can be used as a supplement to the ground networks, to relieve the communication pressure on ground facilities, such as base stations. In this paper, we use multiple UAVs to provide services for vehicles and model the multi-UAV scenario as a collaborative multi-agent system. All UAVs share limited bandwidth resources and equip with edge computing servers to serve the vehicles. In addition, serious consequences may be caused if the delay requirements of vehicles are not satisfied. Therefore, we take vehicle safety as the top priority and the delay requirement as the constraints. Then we exploit the Lagrange multiplier to combine the constraint function and cost function, so as to reduce the resource consumption as much as possible on the premise of ensuring the safety of the vehicles. The influence of channel efficiency and computing power should also be taken into account when allocating resources. We adopt the multi-agent reinforcement learning to train the UAVs, and meanwhile introduce the attention mechanism so that each UAV can optimize itself better with the information of other UAVs. Through a large number of experiments, the effectiveness of our proposed method is verified. Particularly, in the case of strictly limiting bandwidth resources, resources can still be allocated according to vehicle needs under the premise of ensuring vehicle safety.}

	abstract = {Network operators usually adopt Traffic Engineering (TE) to configure the routing in their networks to achieve good load balancing performance and high resource utilization. While centralized TE can effectively improve network performance with a global view of the network, distributed TE has been considered as an alternative to manage large-scale networks that are usually partitioned into multiple regions. However, it is challenging for distributed TE to reach a global optimal performance since each region can make its local routing decisions only based on partially observed network states. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed TE scheme called FedTe, which leverages supervised learning coupled with a collaborative approach to improve the overall load balancing performance for multi-region networks. FedTe learns from the global optimal routing strategy in a centralized offline manner and predicts the optimal distribution of cross-region traffic among different regions through distributed deployment in real time. The predicted cross-region traffic distribution is integrated with measured local traffic to construct each region’s optimal regional traffic matrix, which is used to perform intra-region TE optimization. FedTe can also handle dynamic traffic variation and link failures with a 2-layer hierarchical graph neural network architecture. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we evaluate FedTe with two real-world network topologies and a large-scale synthetic topology. Extensive evaluation results show that FedTe can achieve near-optimal load balancing performance and outperform state-of-the-art distributed TE approaches by up to 28.9% on average.}

	abstract = {Satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) systems are gaining popularity and widely used in many time-sensitive scenarios, including disaster monitoring, emergency response, forecasting and defense. Existing efforts for gathering EO data mainly rely on either ground station networks or geostationary (GEO) satellites. However, our quantitative analysis reveals that existing approaches are either limited as their achievable latency is far away from the desired value due to the insufficient coverage of ground stations, or hard to scale as the number of sensing satellites increases because of the high cost of GEO satellite relays.This paper explores the feasibility and performance of a novel approach that leverages emerging low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations to enable low-latency and scalable EO data delivery from space. We present OrbitCast, a hybrid EO data delivery architecture upon LEO constellations and geo-distributed ground stations to forward EO data from the source remote sensing satellite to a collection of end users. To handle the network dynamicity caused by LEO satellite movements and achieve stable communication over the satellite network, we propose a geo-location driven scheme to forward and deliver data packets. To demonstrate the effectiveness of OrbitCast, we build a testbed driven by public constellation information and implement the OrbitCast prototype on top of the testbed. Extensive realistic-data-driven simulations demonstrate that OrbitCast can significantly reduce the latency as compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and complete the data delivery within five minutes for representative EO data traffic.}

Outdated peering policies and lack of end-to-end performance guarantees are causing its ossification which have led large cloud and content providers to build their own global private backbone infrastructures. As much as these private backbones help eliminate public transit for content hosted across their networks, content hosted elsewhere is still carried over the public Internet. In this poster, we propose a model where these private backbone operators collaborate with the access-networks of content providers and consumers to implement end-to-end network services with better performance characteristics than the public Internet. We call the resulting end-to-end service domain as a "Private Internet".}

	abstract = {In recent years, more and more wireless networks support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. However, in large-scale dual-band wireless networks, lack of understanding on the behavior and performance makes the network diagnosis and optimization extremely challenging. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement to characterize the behavior and performance in a large-scale dual-band wireless network (TD WLAN). We make several meaningful observations. (1) Although the 5GHz band outperforms the 2.4GHz band, 60% of devices tend to be associated with the 2.4GHz band. The device association behavior has a large impact on the performance. (2) Rogue and non-WiFi devices are prevalent, wherein hidden terminal interference increases the average loss rate by 8%, carrier sense interference increases the average WiFi latency by 45%, and RF interference further aggravates both packet loss and channel contention. (3) The dynamic channel assignment strategy is not always effective. On this basis, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to improve the wireless performance by intelligent band navigation and heuristic channel optimization. The actual deployment in TD WLAN shows the packet loss reduces by 40% on average and the WiFi latency for more than 60% of devices is below 5ms.}

	abstract = {TCP incast has become a practical problem for high-bandwidth, low-latency transmissions, resulting in throughput degradation of up to 90% and delays of hundreds of milliseconds, severely impacting application performance. However, in virtualized multi-tenant data centers, host-based advancements in the TCP stack are hard to deploy from the operators perspective. Operators only provide infrastructure in the form of virtual machines, in which only tenants can directly modify the end-host TCP stack. In this paper, we present R-AQM, a switch-powered reverse ACK active queue management (R-AQM) mechanism for enhancing ACK-clocking effects through assisting legacy TCP. Specifically, R-AQM proactively intercepts ACKs and paces the ACK-clocked in-flight data packets, preventing TCP from suffering incast collapse. We implement and evaluate R-AQM in NS-3 simulation and NetFPGA-based hardware switch. Both simulation and testbed results show that R-AQM greatly improves TCP performance under heavy incast workloads by significantly lowering packet loss rate, reducing retransmission timeouts, and supporting 16 times (i.e., 60 → 1000) more senders. Meanwhile, the forward queuing delays are also reduced by 4.6 times.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) collect and transmit data such as live video and radar images, which have different latency and reliability requirements, over wireless links that exhibit much performance variability. In this paper, we make three contributions. First, we show through a characterization of two real-world UAS flight datasets that there is significant opportunity to optimize data transmission in UAS settings by exploiting knowledge of UAS flight paths. Second, we developed Chimera, a system that taps into this opportunity while transmitting heterogeneous data streams over UAS networks. Chimera learns a model online that relates UAS network throughput to the flight path, and combines the model with a control framework that optimizes transmissions based on long-range throughput prediction. Third, with a combination of emulation and simulation experiments using real-world flight traces, we show Chimera’s effectiveness. Specifically, Chimera reduces penalties related to dropped radar images by 72.4%−100% compared to an algorithm agnostic to flight path information, and achieves an average bitrate of 90.5% compared to an optimal scheme that knows the exact future throughput, with only a minimal increase in radar images dropped.}

	abstract = {Measurement capabilities are fundamental for a variety of network applications. Typically, recent data items are more relevant than old ones, a notion we can capture through a sliding window abstraction. These capabilities require a large number of counters in order to monitor the traffic of all network flows. However, SRAM memories are too small to contain these counters. Previous works suggested replacing counters with small estimators, trading accuracy for reduced space. But these estimators only focus on the counters’ size, whereas often flow ids consume more space than their respective counters. In this work, we present the CELL algorithm that combines estimators with efficient flow representation for superior memory reduction.We also extend CELL to the sliding window model, which prioritizes the recent data, by presenting two variants named RAND-CELL and SHIFT-CELL. We formally analyze the error and memory consumption of our algorithms and compare their performance against competing approaches using real-world Internet traces. These measurements exhibit the benefits of our work and show that CELL consumes at least 30% less space than the best-known alternative. The code is available in open source.}

	abstract = {The conventional IP address is designed with fixed length and lacking of extensibility, while the demand for addresses varies greatly in different scenarios. Flexible IP (FlexIP), as a variable length IP address, proactively makes address structure flexible enough to adapt to various network cases. Different lengths of the addresses could be used to accommodate different demands. However, how to efficiently addressing with length variable addresses is still a problem to be solved. The Bloom filter-based addressing scheme appears to be an excellent candidate with the possibility of compact storage and efficient member query. In this paper, we propose an OBF-based scheme using only one Bloom filter. While keeping nearly the same false positive ratio as the conventional Bloom filter-based scheme, the OBF-based scheme significantly improves the addressing efficiency. OBF-based has two key features, one is that it achieves constant, yet small IP lookup time, and another is that it is insensitive to the length of the address. Simulation results show that the addressing scheme we proposed is more suitable for FlexIP addressing than well known schemes.}

	abstract = {With the development of blockchain technology, people always expect that blockchain can be applied to other fields. However, the low Transaction Processing Speed (TPS) and broadcast delay of blockchain still restrict the application of blockchain. To solve these problems, we propose a new scheme named GVScheme to improve the scalability of blockchain network. GVScheme introduces the role of guarantor based on trust value mechanism. The guarantor node will guarantee the block spread in the network. When the node receives the guarantee block from the guarantor node, the order of verification block and propagation block will be determined according to the trust value of the guarantor. By reducing the block verification time, the block propagation delay in the network will also be reduced. It is worth mentioning that our scheme keeps the minimum modification to the blockchain, and may even be directly applied to the blockchain network. Simulation results show that GVScheme can effectively reduce block propagation delay and the fork rate in blockchain network. When the block size and the number of nodes increase, GVScheme also shows great performance. Thus, under the same fork rate, the blockchain using GVScheme can allow less mining interval and larger block size limit.}

It needs more efficient approaches to finish video transmission with more stability and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a self-adaptive transmission scheme of videos for multi-capture terminals under IIoT in this paper. To fit for the constant variation of network environment, we compress the videos that wait for transmitting from multi-capture terminals by reducing the non-key frames with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Moreover, a self-adaptive strategy of transmission is implemented on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server to adjust the transmission volume of processed videos, and a multi-objective optimization algorithm is utilized to optimize the strategy of transmission during the video transmission. The relative experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Layer-4 load balancers play a critical role in large-scale data centers. Recently, load balancers implemented on programmable switches have attracted much attention since they overcome the inflexibility of dedicated load balancers and high latency of software load balancers. However, keeping per-connection state easily leads to storage exhaustion, especially under resource exhaustion attacks. Although several stateless load balancers are proposed to address this issue, the state management burden is offloaded to backend servers, causing high deployment and running costs. In this paper, a load balancer called Loom with compressed states is proposed for large-scale data centers. Firstly, we propose a novel classifier-based load balancer idea to avoid directly maintaining per-connection state. Then, a circulating Bloom filter structure is proposed that can efficiently classify connections as well as be implemented on existing programmable switches. Theoretical analysis shows that Loom can maintain 11 ~ 30x more concurrent connections than those directly storing the 5-tuple of connections. Loom is implemented in hardware P4 switches and experimental results indicate that 11 ~ 29x more concurrent connections can be maintained in Loom, which is close to the theoretical results. Besides, Loom is resistant to resource exhaustion attacks and reduces the percentage of broken connections by up to 57% with an SYN flood.}

	abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) has been frequently abused for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and cache poisoning because it relies on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Since UDP is connection-less, it is trivial for an attacker to spoof the source of a DNS query or response. While other secure transport mechanisms provide identity management, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and DNS Cookies, there is currently no method for a client to state that they only use a given protocol. This paper presents a new method to allow protocol enforcement: DNS Protocol Advertisement Records (DPAR). Advertisement records allow Internet Protocol (IP) address subnets to post a public record in the reverse DNS zone stating which DNS mechanisms are used by their clients. DNS servers may then look up this record and require a client to use the stated mechanism, in turn preventing an attacker from sending spoofed messages over UDP. In this paper, we define the specification for DNS Protocol Advertisement Records, considerations that were made, and comparisons to alternative approaches. We additionally estimate the effectiveness of advertisements in preventing DDoS attacks and the expected burden to DNS servers.}

To this end, we first present a novel distributed system for TE that leverages the latest advancements in ML. Our system implements a novel architecture that combines Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to minimize network congestion. In our evaluation, we compare our MARL+GNN system with DEFO, a network optimizer based on Constraint Programming that represents the state of the art in TE. Our experimental results show that the proposed MARL+GNN solution achieves equivalent performance to DEFO in a wide variety of network scenarios including three real-world network topologies. At the same time, we show that MARL+GNN can achieve significant reductions in execution time (from the scale of minutes with DEFO to a few seconds with our solution).}

	abstract = {Network slicing is a promising technology that allows mobile network operators to efficiently serve various emerging use cases in 5G. It is challenging to optimize the utilization of network infrastructures while guaranteeing the performance of network slices according to service level agreements (SLAs). To solve this problem, we propose SafeSlicing that introduces a new constraint-aware deep reinforcement learning (CaDRL) algorithm to learn the optimal resource orchestration policy within two steps, i.e., offline training in a simulated environment and online learning with the real network system. On optimizing the resource orchestration, we incorporate the constraints on the statistical performance of slices in the reward function using Lagrangian multipliers, and solve the Lagrangian relaxed problem via a policy network. To satisfy the constraints on the system capacity, we design a constraint network to map the latent actions generated from the policy network to the orchestration actions such that the total resources allocated to network slices do not exceed the system capacity. We prototype SafeSlicing on an end-to-end testbed developed by using OpenAirInterface LTE, OpenDayLight-based SDN, and CUDA GPU computing platform. The experimental results show that SafeSlicing reduces more than 20% resource usage while meeting SLAs of network slices as compared with other solutions.}

	abstract = {Due to its superior performance, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) has been widely deployed in data center networks. It provides applications with ultra-high throughput, ultra-low latency, and far lower CPU utilization than TCP/IP software network stack. However, the connection states that must be stored on the RDMA NIC (RNIC) and the small NIC memory result in poor scalability. The performance drops significantly when the RNIC needs to maintain a large number of concurrent connections.We propose StaR (Stateless RDMA), which solves the scalability problem of RDMA by transferring states to the other communication end. Leveraging the asymmetric communication pattern in data center applications, StaR lets the communication end with low concurrency save states for the other end with high concurrency, thus making the RNIC on the bottleneck side to be stateless. We have implemented StaR on an FPGA board with 10Gbps network port and evaluated its performance on a testbed with 9 machines all equipped with StaR NICs. The experimental results show that in high concurrency scenarios, the throughput of StaR can reach up to 4.13x and 1.35x of the original RNIC and the latest software-based solution, respectively.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of Low-power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) in the unlicensed band for various Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Due to the ultra-low transmission power and long transmission duration, LPWAN devices inevitably suffer from high power Cross Technology Interference (CTI), such as interference from Wi-Fi, coexisting in the same spectrum. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces the Partial Symbol Recovery (PSR) scheme for improving the CTI resilience of LPWAN. We verify our idea on LoRa, a widely adopted LPWAN technique, as a proof of concept.At the PHY layer, although CTI has much higher power, its duration is relatively shorter compared with LoRa symbols, leaving part of a LoRa symbol uncorrupted. Moreover, due to its high redundancy, LoRa chips within a symbol are highly correlated. This opens the possibility of detecting a LoRa symbol with only part of the chips. By examining the unique frequency patterns in LoRa symbols with time-frequency analysis, our design effectively detects the clean LoRa chips that are free of CTI. This enables PSR to only rely on clean LoRa chips for successfully recovering from communication failures. We evaluate our PSR design with real-world testbeds, including SX1280 LoRa chips and USRP B210, under Wi-Fi interference in various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design offers reliable packet recovery performance, successfully boosting the LoRa packet reception ratio from 45.2% to 82.2% with a performance gain of 1.8×.}

	abstract = {While recent years have witnessed a steady trend of applying Deep Learning (DL) to networking systems, most of the underlying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) suffer two major limitations. First, they fail to generalize to topologies unseen during training. This lack of generalizability hampers the ability of the DNNs to make good decisions every time the topology of the networking system changes. Second, existing DNNs commonly operate as "blackboxes" that are difficult to interpret by network operators, and hinder their deployment in practice. In this paper, we propose to rely on a recently developed family of graph-based DNNs to address the aforementioned limitations. More specifically, we focus on a network congestion prediction application and apply Graph Attention (GAT) models to make congestion predictions per link using the graph topology and time series of link loads as inputs. Evaluations on three real backbone networks demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in terms of prediction accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability.}

	abstract = {The development of datacenter applications leads to the need for end-to-end communication with microsecond latency. As a result, RDMA is becoming prevalent in datacenter networks to mitigate the latency caused by the slow processing speed of the traditional software network stack. However, existing RDMA congestion control mechanisms are either far from optimal in simultaneously achieving high throughput and low latency or in need of additional in-network function support. In this paper, by leveraging the observation that most congestion occurs at the last hop in datacenter networks, we propose RCC, a receiver-driven rapid congestion control mechanism for RDMA networks that combines explicit assignment and iterative window adjustment. Firstly, we propose a network congestion distinguish method to classify congestions into two types, last-hop congestion and innetwork congestion. Then, an Explicit Window Assignment mechanism is proposed to solve the last-hop congestion, which enables senders to converge to a proper sending rate in one-RTT. For in-network congestion, a PID-based iterative delay-based window adjustment scheme is proposed to achieve fast convergence and near-zero queuing latency. RCC does not need additional innetwork support and is friendly to hardware implementation. In our evaluation, the overall average FCT (Flow Completion Time) of RCC is 4~79% better than Homa, ExpressPass, DCQCN, TIMELY, and HPCC.}

	abstract = {1 Network measurement is indispensable to network operations. Two most promising measurement solutions are In-band Network Telemetry (INT) solutions and sketching solutions. INT solutions provide fine-grained per-switch per-packet information at the cost of high network overhead. Sketching solutions have low network overhead but fail to achieve both simplicity and accuracy for per-flow measurement. To keep their advantages, and at the same time, overcome their shortcomings, we first design SketchINT to combine INT and sketches, aiming to obtain all per-flow per-switch information with low network overhead. Second, for deployment flexibility and measurement accuracy, we design a new sketch for SketchINT, namely TowerSketch, which achieves both simplicity and accuracy. The key idea of TowerSketch is to use different-sized counters for different arrays under the property that the number of bits used for different arrays stays the same. TowerSketch can automatically record larger flows in larger counters and smaller flows in smaller counters. We have fully implemented our SketchINT prototype on a testbed consisting of 10 switches. We also implement our TowerSketch on P4, single-core CPU, multi-core CPU, and FPGA platforms to verify its deployment flexibility. Extensive experimental results verify that 1) TowerSketch achieves better accuracy than prior art on various tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art ElasticSketch up to 13.9 times in terms of error; 2) Compared to INT, SketchINT reduces the number of packets in the collection process by 3 4 orders of magnitude with an error smaller than 5%.}

	abstract = {Connected vehicles (CV) and automated vehicles (AV) are promising technologies for reducing road accidents and improving road efficiency. Significant advances have been achieved for AV and CV technologies, but they both have inherent shortcomings such line of sight sensing for AV. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) has been proposed to address the problems through sharing sensing and cooperative driving. While the focus of the research on CAV has been on the vehicles so far, cooperative and connected smart road infrastructure can play a critical role to enhance CAV and safe driving. In this paper we present an investigation of connected smart road infrastructure and AVs (CRAV). We discuss the potentials and challenges of CRAV, then propose a scalable simulation framework for the CRAV to facilitate fast, economic and quantitative study of CRAV. A case study of CRAV on smart road side unit (RSU) assisted vulnerable road users (VRU) collision warning is conducted, where the identification of VRU such as pedestrians on the road by the AVs is compared with and without RSU assistance. The impact of the location of RSUs on avoiding potential collisions is evaluated for vehicles with different sensor configurations. Preliminary simulation results show that with the support of smart RSUs, the CAVs could be notified of the existence of the VRUs on the road by the RSUs much earlier than they can detect with their own onboard sensors, and collisions with VRUs can be reduced. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CRAV simulation framework and the great potentials of CRAV.}

	abstract = {Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging Ethernet technology for real-time systems. To address different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of applications, IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group has standardized several packet scheduling and shaping algorithms. The software implementation of these algorithms is hard to meet the performance requirements, while the hardware implementation in Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is inflexible. A hardware-programmable scheduler is necessary to deal with this dilemma. Among the existing primitives, the most expressive one is Push-In-Extract-Out (PIEO), but its complexity makes the implementation very expensive. A relatively lower-cost implementation of PIEO cannot guarantee the scheduling correctness for the most critical Time-Triggered (TT) traffic in TSN. As a remedy, in this paper we propose a new Push-In-Pick-Out (PIPO) primitive under a TSN programmable scheduling framework. Composed of simple priority queues, PIPO can express all existing TSN scheduling and shaping algorithms, and is flexible enough to support future ones. Our PIPO implementation guarantees the TT traffic scheduling correctness. The simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis that the low-cost PIPO can closely approximate PIEO and sustain a high bandwidth utilization. The prototype on Xilinx FPGA shows that, with 2,048 inputs, the PIPO-based scheduler achieves a throughput of 70 Mpps, which is 1.64x higher than the PIEO-based one, but using only 14.7% Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and 40.5% Block RAMs of the latter.}

	abstract = {LoRa is a popular technology that enables long-range wireless communication (kilometers) at low energy consumption. The transmission exhibits low throughput and underlies duty cycle restrictions. Long on-air times (up to seconds) and range are susceptible to interference. In parallel, common LoRa-devices are battery driven and should mainly sleep. LoRaWAN is the system that defines the LoRa PHY, MAC, and a complete vertical stack. To deal with the above limitations, LoRaWAN imposes rigorous constraints, namely, a centralized network architecture that organizes media access, and heavily reduced downlink capacity. This makes it unusable for many deployments, control systems in particular. In this work, we combine IEEE802.15.4 DSME and LoRa to facilitate node-to-node communication. We present a DSME-LoRa mapping scheme and contribute a simulation model for validating new LoRa use-cases. Our results show 100% packet delivery and predictable latencies irrespective of network size.}

	abstract = {Programmable switches are recently used for accelerating data-intensive distributed applications. Some computational tasks, traditionally performed on servers in data centers, are offloaded to the network on programmable switches. These tasks may require the support of on-the-fly floatingpoint operations. Unfortunately, the computational capacity of programmable switches is limited to simple integer arithmetic operations. To address this issue, prior approaches either adopt a float-to-integer method or rely on local CPUs of switches, incurring accuracy loss and delayed processing.To this end, we propose NetFC, a table-lookup method to achieve on-the-fly in-network floating-point arithmetic operations nearly without accuracy loss. NetFC adopts a divide-and-conquer mechanism that converts the original huge table into several much smaller tables that are operated by the built-in integer operations. NetFC further leverages a scaling-factor mechanism for improving computational accuracy, and a prefix-based lossless table compression method to reduce memory consumption. We use both synthetic and real-life datasets to evaluate NetFC. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of NetFC is above 99.94% with only 448KB memory consumption. Furthermore, we integrate NetFC into Sonata [12] for detecting Slowloris attack, yielding significant decrease of detection delay.}

Moreover, when considering the high skewness of data streams, this problem will become even worse. Consequently, we propose the trapezoidal sketch (t-sketch) in this paper. In the t-sketch, different from the r-sketch, the counter sizes in different layers are different. Therefore, the low space usage and high capacity can be achieved simultaneously in the t-sketch. Moreover, based on the basic t-sketch, we propose the space-saving t-sketch and the capacity-improvement t-sketch, and analyze the properties of these two t-sketches. Compared with the CM sketch, CU sketch, C sketch, and A sketch, the simulation results show that the performances on space usage, capacity, and estimation accuracy are improved successfully by the space-saving t-sketch and the capacity-improvement t-sketch.}

	abstract = {Internet content providers typically exploit cloud-based content delivery/distribution networks (CDNs) to provide wide-area data access with high availability and low latency. However, from a global perspective, a large portion of users still suffer from high content access latency due to the insufficient deployment of terrestrial cloud infrastructures.This paper presents StarFront, a cost-effective content distribution framework to optimize global CDNs and enable low content access latency anywhere. StarFront builds CDNs upon emerging low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations and existing cloud platforms to satisfy the low-latency requirements while minimizing the operational cost. Specifically, StarFront exploits a key insight that emerging mega-constellations will consist of thousands of LEO satellites equipped with high-speed data links and storage, and thus can potentially work as "cache in space" to enable pervasive and low-latency data access. StarFront judiciously places replicas on either LEO satellites or clouds, and dynamically assigns user requests to proper cache servers based on constellation parameters, cloud/user distributions and pricing policies. Extensive trace-driven evaluations covering geo-distributed vantage points have demonstrated that: StarFront can effectively reduce the global content access latency with acceptable operational cost under representative CDN traffic.}

	abstract = {Domain Name System (DNS) is known to present privacy concerns. To this end, decentralized blockchains have been used to host DNS records, so that users can synchronize with the blockchain to maintain a local DNS database and resolve domain names locally. However, existing blockchain-based solutions either do not guarantee a domain name is controlled by its "true" owner; or have to resort to DNSSEC, a not yet widely adopted protocol, for verifying ownership. In this paper, we present DNSonChain, a new blockchain-based naming service compatible with DNS. It allows domain owners to claim their domain ownership on the blockchain where DNS records are hosted. The core function of DNSonChain is to validate the domain ownership in a decentralized manner. We propose a majority vote mechanism that randomly selects multiple participants (i.e., voters) in the system to vote for the authority of domain ownership. To provide resistance to attacks from fraudulent voters, DNSonChain requires two rounds of voting processes. Our security analysis shows that DNSonChain is robust against several types of security failures, able to recover from various attacks. We implemented a prototype of DNSonChain as an Ethereum decentralized application and evaluate it on an Ethereum Testnet.}

	abstract = {Many Internet-connected appliances are often moved to different environments, such as when they are re-located. And even when they are buried in a given physical environment, their ownership "moves", such as when a home or smart space changes hands. This calls for roaming-friendly IoT authentication devised to circumvent the need to deploy long-term authentication credentials across different visited domains. Noting that this issue has been very extensively addressed since at least three decades in cellular network, in this paper we integrate, within the RIOT IoT Operating system, an authentication and key agreement protocol designed to be as close as possible to the standard one used by 4G/5G cellular systems. Our design accounts for a few technical improvements made possible since, unlike the case of cellular networks, we are here free from back-ward compatibility issues. Our proof-of-concept implementation is built on COAP for the radio interface, and on HTTPS for the core network signaling parts, and can be further configured to use two different types of secret keys: pre-shared or on-demand, (re)generated via a SRAM-PUF API available in RIOT.}

	abstract = {Deploying a new network architecture in the Internet requires changing some, but not necessarily all elements between communicating applications. One way to achieve gradual deployment is a proxy or gateway which "translates" between the new architecture and TCP/IP. We present such a proxy, called "Performance Enhancing Proxy for Deploying Network Architectures (PEP-DNA)", which allows TCP/IP applications to benefit from advanced features of a new network architecture without having to be redeveloped. Our proxy is a kernel-based Linux implementation which can be installed wherever a translation needs to occur between a new architecture and TCP/IP domains. We discuss the proxy operation in detail and evaluate its efficiency and performance in a local testbed, demonstrating that it achieves high throughput with low additional latency overhead. In our experiments, we use the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) and Information-Centric Networking (ICN) as examples, but our proxy is modular and flexible, and hence enables realistic gradual deployment of any new "clean-slate" approaches.}

	abstract = {Network Functions (NFs) provide security and optimization services to networks by examining and modifying packets and by collecting information. When NFs need to be scaled out to manage higher load or scaled in to conserve energy, flows need to be migrated from one instance of an NF, called the source instance, to another, called the destination instance, or from one chain of instances to another chain of instances. Before flows are migrated, the state information associated with the source instance needs to be migrated to the destination instance. Packets that arrive at the destination instance meanwhile need to be either buffered or dropped until the state information is migrated, for correct functioning of some stateful NFs, while for some others, the destination NF may continue to function. We define the properties of Loss-freedom, where the flow migration system does not drop packets, No-buffering, where it does not buffer packets, and Order-preservation, where it processes packets in the same manner as the source NF, if there was no flow migration. We formalize these properties, for the first time, and prove that it is impossible for a flow migration algorithm in stateful NFs to guarantee satisfying all three of the properties of Loss-freedom (L), Order-preservation (O) and No-buffering (N) during flow migration, even if messages or packets are not lost. We demonstrate how existing algorithms operate with regard to these properties and prove that these properties are compositional.}

	abstract = {With the development of 5G, innovative applications requiring bounded transmission delays and zero packet loss emerge, e.g., AR, industrial automation, and smart grid. In this circumstance, time-sensitive networking (TSN) is proposed, which addresses the deterministic transmission in the local area networks. Nevertheless, TSN is essentially a Layer 2 technique, which cannot provide deterministic transmission on a large geographic area. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical network for the end-to-end deterministic transmission. In the proposed network, we leverage CQF (i.e., one of the most efficient TSN mechanisms) in the access networks which aggregates the traffic from end-devices. Meanwhile, in the core network, we exploit the DIP (i.e., a well-known deterministic networking mechanism for backbone networks) for long-distance deterministic transmission. We design the cycle alignment mechanism to enable seamless and deterministic transmission among hierarchical networks. A joint schedule is also formulated, which introduces the traffic shaping at the network edge to maximize the network throughput. Experimental simulations show that the proposed network can achieve end-to-end deterministic transmission, even in the highly-load scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes an IP forwarding information base (FIB) encoding leveraging an emerging data structure called a learned index , which uses machine learning to associate key-position pairs in a key-value store. A learned index for FIB lookups is expected to yield a more compact representation and faster lookups compared to existing FIBs based on tries or hash tables, at the cost of efficient FIB updates, which is difficult to support with a learned index. We optimize our implementation for lookup speed, exploiting that for efficient FIB lookups it is enough to approximate the key-position pairs with a piece-wise linear function, instead of having to learn the key-position pairs. The experiments using real BGP routing information snapshots suggest that the size of the proposed FIB is compact and lookup speed is sufficiently fast regardless of the length of matched prefixes.}

However, the lack of routing authentication and validation makes it vulnerable to attacks, including routing leaks, route hijacking, prefix hijacking, etc. Therefore, in this paper we propose a generalized framework for ISP self-operated BGP anomaly detection based on weakly supervised learning. To tackle the problem of insufficient data in BGP anomaly detection, we propose an approach to learn from the other anomaly detection systems through knowledge distillation. To reduce the impact of inaccurate supervision, we design a self-attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to self-adaptively mine the differences between BGP anomaly categories, including both feature and time dimensions. Finally, we implement a system and demonstrate the performance through a set of comprehensive experiments. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, our scheme has better generalization on various anomaly types.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed to boost high-efficient and time-sensitive 5G applications. However, the "microburst" may occur even in lightly-loaded scenarios, which leads to the indeterministic service latency, hence hindering the deployment of MEC. Deterministic IP networking (DIP) has been proposed to provide bounds on latency, and high reliability in the large-scale networks. Nevertheless, the direct migration of DIP into the MEC network is non-trivial owing to its original design for the Ethernet with homogeneous devices. Meanwhile, DIP also faces the challenges on the network throughput and scheduling flexibility. In this paper, we delve into the adoption of DIP for the MEC networks and some of the relevant aspects. A deterministic MEC (D-MEC) network is proposed to deliver the deterministic MEC service. In the D-MEC network, the cycle mapping and cycle shifting are designed to enable: (i) seamless and deterministic transmission with heterogeneous underlaid resources; and (ii) traffic shaping on the edges to improve the resource utilization. We also formulate a joint configuration to maximize the network throughput with deterministic QoS guarantees. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed D-MEC network can achieve a deterministic MEC service, even in the highly-loaded scenarios.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the vehicular ad hoc networking (VANET) concept has supported the development of emerging safety related applications for vehicles based on cooperative awareness between vehicles. This cooperative awareness can be achieved by exploiting wireless sensors and technologies to transmit periodic messages to neighboring vehicles. These messages normally contain information regarding vehicles, such as position, speed, distance between vehicles, etc. For the transfer of safety messages, Wi-Fi and the suit of IEEE 802.11p/WAVE protocols were commonly used initially but now cellular-based LTE and 5G are the emerging technologies for VANETs. In this paper, a comparison is performed considering the European ITS-G5 standard, Wi-Fi, LTE and 5G by exchanging safety messages in VANETs. We have exchanged real-time road weather and traffic observation data to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned wireless technologies in terms of successful message delivery probability. Our results reveal that due to weak communication links and the lack of line of sight (LOS) communication for Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios, Wi-Fi and 802.11p are outperformed by LTE and 5G networks.}

	abstract = {In-network caching is a basic feature of ICN architecture. Traditional ICN is distributed, which means the locations of content blocks cannot be adjusted precisely. Therefore, the cache allocation in traditional ICN is hard to approach optimization. With the aid of centralized controllers provided by SDN, ICN can manipulate the cache allocation with high flexibility. Heuristic algorithms have been applied to the cache allocation of ICN with centralized controllers but cannot guarantee the feasibility of solutions because of the feature of randomness. This paper proposes a caching strategy named MRPGA based on genetic algorithms. The mechanism of MRPGA guarantees the feasibility of solutions and accelerates convergence. Also, the simulations show that MRPGA figures out a better cache distribution in a shorter time than the genetic algorithm.}

Our approach can significantly lower the reaction time, such that the congestion control implementation can adapt much faster to changing network conditions.

	abstract = {With the objective of supporting next generation driving services, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been regarded as promising paradigms to implement global ubiquitous and high-capacity vehicular connections. However, due to the high moving speed, different satellites can only service a specific set of vehicles for few minutes. In such case, due to the limited computing capability of the satellite, machine learning (ML) based and non-ML based solutions cannot be performed within such a short duration. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-tier collaborative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme for resource allocation in NTN empowered vehicular networks, in which ground vehicles and LEO satellites maintain DRL-based decision model to obtain resource allocation decisions cooperatively. Specifically, ground vehicles with powerful computing capabilities can assist the satellite to tackle resource allocation optimizations, and the satellite determines final decisions and model parameters by aggregating local calculated results of vehicles. Additionally, the parameters of DRL-based decision model can be transferred from the current satellite to its successor as the starting point for future resource allocation decision-makings. Comprehensive simulations have been conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {In-band network telemetry (INT) enriches network management at scale through the embedding of complete device-internal states into each packet along its forwarding path, yet such embedding of INT information also incurs significant band-width overhead in the data plane. We propose DeltaINT, a general INT framework that achieves extremely low bandwidth overhead and supports various packet-level and flow-level applications in network management. DeltaINT builds on the insight that state changes are often negligible at most time, so it embeds a state into a packet only when the state change is deemed significant. We theoretically derive the time/space complexities and the bounds of bandwidth mitigation for DeltaINT. We implement DeltaINT in both software and P4. Our evaluation shows that DeltaINT reduces up to 93% of INT bandwidth, and its deployment in a Barefoot Tofino switch incurs limited hardware resource usage.}

	abstract = {Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) is a popular solution for high-speed flow table lookup in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Rule insertion in TCAM is a time-consuming operation. To ensure semantic correctness, rules overlapped must be stored in TCAM with decreasing priority order and many rule movements may be needed to make space for a single inserted rule. When a rule insertion is in progress, the regular flow table lookup will be suspended, which could lead to a degraded user experience for SDN applications. In this paper, we propose a multiple-TCAM framework named MagicTCAM to reduce the rule movements during a rule insertion. The core of MagicTCAM lies in three operations: layering, partitioning and rotating. By layering, rules with the least overlapping will be grouped (i.e., layered) into a sub-ruleset. The number of rule movements is therefore greatly reduced as most of rules in a sub-ruleset are non-overlapped. To achieve balanced load in TCAMs, rules in each sub-ruleset are further partitioned and dispatched into different TCAMs in a rotating manner. In addition, an inter-TCAM movement algorithm is proposed to allow rules to be moved between TCAMs for reduced rule movement. Experiment results show that with two half-sized TCAMs, MagicTCAM reduces the rule movements by 39% on average compared with the state-of-the-art work while the computation time is shortened by half as well.}

	abstract = {The rapid popularization of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology promotes the wide adoption of wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Traditional methods only focus on how to optimize network performance, and most of them overlook the energy waste issue induced by WPT. In this paper, we explore the potentials of recycling wasted energy when using WPT by means of freeloading. Specifically, with a slight modification on hardware, we expand the functionality of the mobile chargers (MCs), enabling them to harvest and recycle the WPT-induced wasted energy in the air to serve more sensors, which promotes energy efficiency. We model the problem, termed MEFree, as maximizing network energy efficiency by utilizing a limited number of freeloading MCs and scheduling their freeloading behaviors. Through jointly scheduling freeloading and charging tasks, the proposed scheme is able to solve the problem with a (1 − 1/e)/2 approximation ratio with a slightly relaxed budget. Extensive simulations are conducted and corresponding numerical results show that our proposed scheme significantly improves network energy efficiency by at least 18.8% and outperforms baseline algorithms by 19.1% on average in various aspects. Our test-bed experiments further demonstrate the practicability of our scheme in actual scenes.}

	abstract = {Vehicle platooning is one of the advanced driving applications expected to be supported by the 5G vehicle to everything (V2X) communications. It holds great potentials on improving road efficiency, driving safety and fuel efficiency. Apart from the organization and internal communication of the platoons, real-time prediction of surrounding road users (such as vehicles and cyclists) is another critical issue. While artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interests on its application to trajectory prediction, there is a potential problem that the pre-trained neural network models may not well fit the current driving environment and needs online fine-tuning to maintain an acceptable high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a digital twin based real-time trajectory prediction scheme for platoons of connected intelligent vehicles. In this scheme the head vehicle of a platoon senses the surrounding vehicles. A LSTM neural network is applied for real-time trajectory prediction with the sensing outcomes. The head vehicle controls the offloading of the trajectory data and maintains a digital twin to optimize the update of LSTM model. In the digital twin a Deep-Q Learning (DQN) algorithm is utilized for adaptive fine tuning of the LSTM model, to ensure the prediction accuracy and minimize the consumption of communication and computing resources. A real-world dataset is developed from the KITTI datasets for simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory prediction scheme can maintain a prediction accuracy for safe platooning and reduce the delay of updating the neural networks by up to 40%.}

	abstract = {The deadline requirements of real-time applications rapidly increase in recent years (e.g., cloud gaming, cloud VR, online conferencing). Due to diverse network conditions, meeting deadline requirements for these applications has become one of the research hotspots. However, the current schemes focus on providing high bitrate instead of meeting deadline requirements. In this paper, we propose D3T, a flexible deadline-aware transmission mechanism that aims to improve user quality of experience (QoE) for real-time video streaming. To fulfill the diverse deadline requirements over fluctuating network conditions, D3T uses a deadline-aware scheduler to select the high priority frame before the deadline. To reduce congestion and retransmission delay, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to make decisions of sending rate and FEC (forward error correction) redundancy ratio based on observed network status and frame information. We evaluate D3T via trace-driven simulator spanning diverse network environments, video contents and QoE metrics. D3T significantly improves the frame completion rate by reducing the bandwidth waste before the deadline. In the considered scenarios, D3T outperforms previously approaches with the improvements in average QoE of 57%.}

At present, packet schedulers that can support hierarchical link sharing are not suitable for an implementation at line rates, whereas deployed schedulers perform poorly at distributing excess capacity to classes that need additional bandwidth. We present HLS, a packet scheduler that ensures a hierarchical max-min fair allocation of the link bandwidth. HLS supports minimum rate guarantees and isolation between classes. Since it is realized as a non-hierarchical round-robin scheduler, it is suitable to operate at high rates. We implement HLS in the Linux kernel and evaluate it with respect to achieved rate allocations and overhead. We compare the results with those obtained for CBQ and HTB, the existing scheduling algorithms in Linux for hierarchical link sharing. We show that the overhead of HLS is comparable to that of other classful packet schedulers.}

	abstract = {The P4 language allows "protocol-independent packet parsing" in network switches, and makes many operations possible in the data plane. But P4 is not built for Deep Packet Inspection – it can only "parse" well-defined packet headers, not free-form headers as seen in HTTPS etc. Thus some very important use cases, such as application-layer firewalls, are considered impossible for P4. This demonstration shows that this limitation is not strictly true: switches, that support only standard P4, are able to independently perform tasks such as blocking specific URLs (without using non-standard "extern" components, help from the SDN controller, or rerouting to a firewall). As more Internet infrastructure becomes SDN-compatible, in future, switches may perform simple application-layer firewall tasks.}

	abstract = {Sampling is key to handling mismatch between the line rate and the throughput of a network traffic measurement module. Flow-spread measurement requires non-duplicate sampling, which only samples the elements (carried in packet header or payload) in each flow when they appear for the first time and blocks them for subsequent appearances. The only prior work for non-duplicate sampling incurs considerable overhead, and has two practical limitations: It lacks a mechanism to set an appropriate sampling probability under dynamic traffic conditions, and it cannot efficiently handle multiple concurrent sampling tasks. This paper proposes a virtual filter design for non-duplicate sampling, which reduces the processing overhead by about half and reduces the memory overhead by an order of magnitude or more under some practical settings. It has a mechanism to automatically adapt its sampling probability to the traffic dynamics. It can be extended to solve a new problem called non-duplicate distribution sampling, which samples packets based on a probability distribution to support multiple concurrent measurement tasks.}

Notably, we show that encapsulation of UAVs in C-ITS does not imply significant changes for the currently existing mechanisms and data formats. Finally, we discuss some of the open research challenges related to the integration and operation of the integrated systems and pinpoint some mechanisms which can help to address these.}

	abstract = {Despite the bandwidth scaling limit of electrical switching and the high cost of building Clos data center networks (DCNs), the adoption of optical DCNs is still limited. There are two reasons. First, existing optical DCN designs usually face tremendous deployment complexity. Second, these designs are not full-optical and the performance benefit against the non-blocking Clos DCN is not clear.After exploring the design tradeoffs of the existing optical DCN designs, we propose TROD (Threshold Routing based Optical Datacenter), a low-complexity optical DCN with superior performance than other optical DCNs. There are two novel designs in TROD that contribute to its success. First, TROD performs robust topology optimization based on the recurring traffic patterns and thus does not need to react to every traffic change, which lowers deployment and management complexity. Second, TROD introduces tVLB (threshold-based VLB), which can avoid network congestion as much as possible even under unexpected traffic bursts. We conduct simulation based on both Facebook’s real DCN traces and our synthesized highly bursty DCN traces. TROD reduces flow completion time (FCT) by at least 2× compared with the existing optical DCN designs, and by approximately 2.4-3.2× compared with expander graph DCN. Compared with the non-blocking Clos, TROD reduces the hop count of the majority packets by one, and could even outperform the non-blocking Clos with proper bandwidth over-provision at the optical layer. Note that TROD can be built with commercially available hardware and does not require host modifications.}

	abstract = {Consensus protocols are a key feature in decentral-ized systems where multiple unreliable nodes operate, e.g., in Blockchain technologies with many worldwide applications such as supply chain management, cryptocurrencies and information sharing. ISRaft is a consensus protocol built upon Raft, a previously developed protocol that is used for replicated state machines when a group of nodes is required to achieve a consensus related to the state of the machine. This paper therefore proposes an alternative version of the ISRaft consensus protocol to allow communication among nodes in a secured fashion while maintaining the security features of the original ISRaft algorithm even in the presence of adversarial nodes. The proposed model utilizes a trust parameter to enforce cooperation, i.e., a trust value is assigned to each node to prevent malicious activities over time. This is a practical solution for autonomous units with resource-constrained devices where a regular encrypted communication method can negatively affect the system performance.}

	abstract = {Modern datacenter applications bring fundamental challenges to transport protocols as they simultaneously require low latency and high throughput. Recent receiver-driven trans-port protocols transmit only one data packet once receiving each grant or credit packet from the receiver to achieve ultra-low queueing delay and zero packet loss. However, the round-trip time variation and the highly dynamic background traffic significantly deteriorate the performance of receiver-driven transport protocols, resulting in under-utilized bandwidth. This paper designs a simple yet effective solution called RPO that retains the advantages of receiver-driven transmission while efficiently utilizing the available bandwidth. Specifically, RPO rationally uses low-priority opportunistic packets to ensure high network utilization without increasing the queueing delay of high-priority normal packets. In addition, since RPO only uses Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking function and priority queues, RPO is ready to deploy on switches. We implement RPO in Linux hosts with DPDK. Our small-scale testbed experiments and large-scale simulations show that RPO significantly improves the network utilization by up to 35% under high workload over the state-of-the-art receiver-driven transmission schemes, without introducing additional queueing delay.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of vehicular networks, there is an increasing demand for extensive networking, computing and caching resources. In fact, vehicular networks are nonstationary, and how to allocate multiple resources effectively and efficiently for dynamic vehicular networks is extremely important, however, really challenging. In this paper, we propose a general framework that can enable fast-adaptive edge resource allocation for dynamic vehicular environment. Specifically, we model the dynamics of the vehicular environment as a series of related Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We combine hierarchical reinforcement learning with meta learning, which makes our proposed framework available to quickly adapt to a new environment by only fine-tuning the top-level master network, and meanwhile the low-level sub-networks can make the right resource allocation policy. The extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which can quickly adapt to different scenarios. This is consistent with the real-world situations and can significantly improve the performance of resource allocation in dynamic vehicular networks.}

	abstract = {Low latency is an important design goal for reliable data transmission protocols such as TCP and QUIC. However, timeout-based loss recovery can unnecessarily increase end-to-end latency. Previous work in reducing timeout-based loss recovery latency either duplicates every packet to avoid loss or focuses on fine-tuning the timeout timers to shorten the timeout latency without causing spurious packet retransmissions. In this work, we propose a new mechanism called Selective Loss Prevention (SLP) to reduce the loss recovery latency of a reliable transport protocol. Through extensive trace analysis, we find that not all lost packets are equal. The loss of packets with certain flags, such as SYN and PSH, is more likely to cause timeouts than other packets. Based on this observation, we propose to selectively duplicate an "important" packet whose loss is likely to increase a connection\'s latency. We design an algorithm to determine when to duplicate a lost packet proactively and incorporate it into TCP\'s congestion control algorithm so that duplicate packets will not congest the network. We incorporate SLP into Linux\'s kernel and evaluate its performance. Our results show that SLP can reduce timeout-based latency caused by the loss of important packets in a connection, and its overhead is low.}

	abstract = {In cellular networks, cell selection plays a critical role in providing and maintaining ubiquitous radio access. It follows standardized procedures with operator-specific polices pre-configured by tunable parameters. These parameters specify the criteria to determine whether and how to select new serving cell(s), thus impacting access quality and user experience. Recent studies reveal that today’s cell selection fails to offer good performance as it can. This is because it is configured for seamless connectivity, and thus performance is offered at "best effort". In this work, we attempt to re-configure these parameters by taking performance into consideration. We first conduct a measurement study in one big city in the US to demonstrate that reconfiguration indeed helps improve the overall performance, without compromising connectivity. This implies that 4G/5G networks are capable of offering better performance but such potentials are under-utilized in practice. We further explore proactive reconfiguration to prevent such unnecessary performance losses. We examine technical challenges, factors and even limitations to reconfigure cell selection in a standard-compatible manner, and finally devise a simple reconfiguration algorithm based on profiling and heuristic searching to efficiently pursue promising performance gains. The evaluation over AT&T and T-Mobile in two US cities has validated its effectiveness. Performance gains outweigh losses. Reconfiguration boosts data speed in more than 30% of instances, which exceeds the ratio of losses by at least 16%; The median speed gain is at least 89.1% (up to 217 fold).}

	abstract = {LoRa has been shown as a promising Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology to connect millions of devices for the Internet of Things by providing long-distance low-power communication in a very low SNR. Real LoRa networks, however, suffer from severe packet collisions. Existing collision resolution approaches introduce a high SNR loss, i.e., require a much higher SNR than LoRa. To push the limit of LoRa collision decoding, we present AlignTrack, the first LoRa collision decoding approach that can work in the SNR limit of the original LoRa. Our key finding is that a LoRa chirp aligned with a decoding window should lead to the highest peak in the frequency domain and thus has the least SNR loss. By aligning a moving window with different packets, we separate packets by identifying the aligned chirp in each window. We theoretically prove this leads to the minimal SNR loss. In practical implementation, we address two key challenges: (1) accurately detecting the start of each packet, and (2) separating collided packets in each window in the presence of CFO and inter-packet interference. We implement AlignTrack on HackRF One and compare its performance with the state-of-the-arts. The evaluation results show that AlignTrack improves network throughput by 1.68× compared with NScale and 3× compared with CoLoRa.}

	abstract = {Service-level objectives (SLOs), as network performance requirements for delay and packet loss typically, should be guaranteed for increasing high-performance applications, e.g., telesurgery and cloud gaming. However, SLO violations are common and destructive in today’s network operation. Detection and diagnosis, meaning monitoring performance to discover anomalies and analyzing causality of SLO violations respectively, are crucial for fast recovery. Unfortunately, existing diagnosis approaches require exhaustive causal information to function. Meanwhile, existing detection tools incur large overhead or are only able to provide limited information for diagnosis. This paper presents DOVE, a diagnosis-driven SLO detection system with high accuracy and low overhead. The key idea is to identify and report the information needed by diagnosis along with SLO violation alerts from the data plane selectively and efficiently. Network segmentation is introduced to balance scalability and accuracy. Novel algorithms to measure packet loss and percentile delay are implemented completely on the data plane without the involvement of the control plane for fine-grained SLO detection. We implement and deploy DOVE on Tofino and P4 software switch (BMv2) and show the effectiveness of DOVE with a use case. The reported SLO violation alerts and diagnosis-needing information are compared with ground truth and show high accuracy (>97%). Our evaluation also shows that DOVE introduces up to two orders of magnitude less traffic overhead than NetSight. In addition, memory utilization and required processing ability are low to be deployable in real network topologies.}

Classic MPTCPs have good friendliness and practicality such as relatively low overhead, but are hard to achieve consistent high-throughput and adaptability, especially for the ability of flexibly balancing congestion among different paths. In contrast, learning-based MPTCPs can essentially achieve consistent high-throughput and adaptability, but have poor friendliness and practicality. In this paper, we proposed MPLibra, a combined multipath congestion control framework that can complement the advantages of classic MPTCPs and learning-based MPTCPs. Extensive simulations on NS3 show that MPLibra can achieve good performance and outperform state-of-the-art MPTCPs under different network conditions.

	abstract = {In recent years, large enterprises (e.g., Google, Alibaba, etc.) have been building and deploying their wide-area routers based on shallow-buffered switching chips. However, with legacy reactive transport (e.g., TCP Cubic), shallow buffer can easily get overwhelmed by large BDP wide-area traffic, leading to high packet losses and degraded throughput. To address it, we ask: can we design a transport to simultaneously achieve high throughput and low loss for shallow-buffered WAN?We answer this question affirmatively by employing proactive congestion control (PCC). However, two issues exist for existing PCC to work on WAN. Firstly, wide-area traffics have diverse RTTs, leading to what we called imperfect scheduling issue (e.g., data crash in time). Secondly, there is one RTT delay for credits to trigger data sending, which may degrade network performance. Therefore, we propose a novel PCC design - FlashPass. To address the first issue, FlashPass adopts sender-driven emulation process with send time calibration to avoid the data packet crash. To address the second issue, FLASHPASS enables early data transmission in the starting phase, and incorporates an over-provisioning with selective dropping mechanism for efficient credit allocation in the finishing phase. Our evaluation with production workload demonstrates that FlashPass reduces the overall flow completion times of TCP Cubic and ExpressPass by up to 32% and 11.4%, and the 99-th tail completion times of small flows by up to 49.5% and 38%, respectively.}
