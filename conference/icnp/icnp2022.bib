	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel delay-aware selective admission and scheduling algorithm for time-critical applications to guarantee the delay requirement of each packet in a single-hop downlink network. We consider a series of priorities among packets. To avoid always starving low-priority packets, we define a delay-laxity concept and introduce a new output gain model as our network utility function. In this context, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that minimizes the average queue backlog and maximizes the average network utility under the constraints of guaranteeing per-packet delay and achieving fairness among users. To solve this problem, we model our problem as a Markov Decision Process and propose a Double Deep Q Network-based algorithm to learn the optimal policy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant improvements in average delay, delay-outage drop rate, and goodput compared with the existing stochastic schemes. Moreover, the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional Q-learning algorithm in terms of reward and learning speed.}

	abstract = {The 5G user plane function (UPF) is a critical inter-connection point between the data network and cellular network infrastructure. It governs the packet processing performance of the 5G core network. UPFs also need to be flexible to support several key control plane operations. Existing UPFs typically run on general-purpose CPUs, but have limited performance because of the overheads of host-based forwarding. We design Synergy, a novel 5G UPF running on SmartNICs that provides high throughput and low latency. It also supports monitoring functionality to gather critical data on user sessions for the prediction and optimization of handovers during user mobility. The SmartNIC UPF efficiently buffers data packets during handover and paging events by using a two-level flow-state access mechanism. This enables maintaining flow-state for a very large number of flows, thus providing very low latency for control and data planes and high throughput packet forwarding. Mobility prediction can reduce the handover delay by pre-populating state in the UPF and other core NFs. Synergy performs handover predictions based on an existing recurrent neural network model. Synergy's mobility predictor helps us achieve 2.32× lower average handover latency. Buffering in the SmartNIC, rather than the host, during paging and handover events reduces packet loss rate by at least 2.04×. Compared to previous approaches to building programmable switch-based UPFs, Synergy speeds up control plane operations such as handovers because of the low P4-programming latency leveraging tight coupling between SmartNIC and host.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) providing server capabilities at near end-users is introduced to enable Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) for mission-critical and time-sensitive networked services. However, the current MEC simply shortens the physical travel distance of traffic but does not include any architectural approach for supporting URLLC. As a result, MEC implicates resource contention issues, and important packets can be easily delayed or lost, resulting in critical flaws for those services. To address these problems, we introduce MECaNIC, which extends the data plane of MEC to SmartNIC and assists URLLC of MEC. It provides i) precise packet scheduling that handles traffic priorities into two dimensions of reliability and latency, and ii) task offloading that accelerates MEC applications, including payload matching and response caching. The prototype implemented using NetFPGA shows that MECaNIC reduces the average latency of the high-priority traffic from 2,883\\ \\mu s to 397\\ \\mu s while ensuring packet delivery, even when the traffic competes with other lower priority traffic. Also, task offloading improves a MEC's payload processing 4-fold and reduces file downloading time and video random access time by 44% and 17%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Protocol reverse engineering can be applied to various security applications, including fuzzing, malware analysis, and intrusion detection. It aims to acquire an unknown protocol's format, semantic, and behavior specifications, where format extraction is the primary task. One subset of the mainstream research utilizes the network traffic for the reverse analysis. These approaches leverage various algorithms, such as multiple sequence alignment, frequent itemset mining, and information entropy to extract format information from messages. However, they are primarily intended to locate the keyword fields and have limitations in extracting contextual features or dealing with large data sets. This paper presents ProsegDL, a deep learning-based format extraction tool for binary protocol, with a specially designed method of generating training data sets. ProsegDL innovatively leverages image semantic segmentation and siamese network techniques, focusing on extracting the features of fields and identifying field boundaries for fixed format protocols. The tool is evaluated on six popular protocols. The results show that it has at most 13% higher precision, 23% higher recall than the comparison methods when inferring with a small data set, and at most 18% higher precision, 28% higher recall when inferring with a large number of messages.}

	abstract = {Configuration Synthesis promises to increase automation in network hardware configuration but is generally assumed to constitute a computationally hard problem. We conduct a formal analysis of the computational complexity of network-wide Configuration Synthesis to establish this claim formally. To that end, we consider Configuration Synthesis as a decision problem, whether or not the selected routing protocol(s) can implement a given set of forwarding properties. We find the complexity of Configuration Synthesis heavily depends on the combination of the forwarding properties that need to be implemented in the network, as well as the employed routing protocol(s). Our analysis encompasses different forwarding properties that can be encoded as path constraints, and any combination of distributed destination-based hop-by-hop routing protocols. Many of these combinations yield NP-hard Configuration Synthesis problems; in particular, we show that the satisfiability of a set of arbitrary waypoints for any hop-by-hop routing protocol is NP-complete. Other combinations, however, show potential for efficient, scalable Configuration Synthesis.}

	abstract = {As an emerging Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technology, LoRa is dedicated to providing long-range connections for pervasive Internet-of-Things devices. As LoRa operates in the unlicensed spectrum, transmissions from multiple LoRa end-devices inevitably collide into each other, leading to packet losses and increased transmission delay. Targeting at collisions caused by interferences under the same spreading factor (SF) settings, researchers introduce multiple lines of techniques. Despite their efforts, these techniques commonly neglect the potential collisions caused by interferences under different SF settings, which are resulted by the imperfect orthogonality. Given the disparate transmission power configurations and diverse deployed locations, the collisions under different SFs commonly exist in practical networks, and significantly limit the LoRa reliability. In this paper, we present X-MAC, the first scheduler that is aware of imperfect orthogonality. Technically, X-MAC detects the collisions under different SFs via tracking historical transmissions, and further performs dynamic channel scheduling to avoid collisions caused by interferences both under the same and different SFs. Extensive evaluations on testbed devices show that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, X-MAC boosts the network scalability (number of concurrent end-devices) by 2.41× with packet reception rate (PRR) requirement of > 95%.}

LEO satellite networks can be used for Internet access and for the Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) integration with 5G and beyond. Our new addressing method leverages the characteristics of satellites with known orbit elements; and simplifies the satellite identification by using limited indexes. The new routing method combines semantic addressing with source routing and generates a new semantic routing scheme. Compared with traditional methods, the new proposal dramatically reduces the workload in satellite, such as table size, TCAM (Ternary Content-addressable Memory) lookups, and packet header size. Thus, it is more suitable to network in space where the harsh environment will restrict the hardware performance, power consumption, link bandwidth and system complexity.}

To improve scalability of SMT solving, we introduce a modular verification approach to network control plane verification, where we cut a network into smaller fragments. Users specify an annotated cut which describes how to generate these fragments from the monolithic network, and we verify each fragment independently, using these annotations to define assumptions and guarantees over fragments akin to assume-guarantee reasoning. We prove this modular network verification procedure is sound and complete with respect to verification over the monolithic network. We implement this procedure as Kirigami, an extension of NV [25] - a network verification language and tool - and evaluate it on industrial topologies with synthesized policies. We observe a 10x improvement in end-to-end NV verification time, with SMT solve time improving by up to 6 orders of magnitude.}

	abstract = {Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is proposed in recent years to satisfy the strict performance requirements of time-sensitive traffic in a growing number of emerging applications. Even though several traffic scheduling algorithms have been standardized for TSN to pursue this goal, time-sensitive flows may not be forwarded as planned and thus fail to achieve the expected performance in real networks. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that static offline planning cannot adapt to the intrinsic dynamic factors in TSN (e.g., time-synchronization error) at runtime. Hence, next-generation TSN will benefit from a closed-loop design where a performance monitoring system provides feedback of real-time packet-forwarding information. In our research, TSN-Peeper, a light-weight, fast-response and full-coverage TSN performance monitoring system, is designed and evaluated. This paper describes its architecture design and data collection mechanisms that enable timely identification and collection of packet-forwarding misbehavior at low-cost in TSN. TSN-Peeper offloads the misbehavior identification in the switch to relieve the burden on the controller and network bandwidth. To reduce the interruption frequency to the controller, it uses probe packets to collect misbehavior information in aggregation with optimized path planning. To realize controllable reporting delays, it optimizes the sending moments of probe packets according to the flow settings. Experimental results verify that TSN-Peeper offers fast response with low cost while providing full coverage and being scalable.}

	abstract = {Reposting plays an essential role in visibility boosting in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, we study the problem of designing “reposting service” in an OSN to incentivize “transactions” between requesters (users who seek to enhance visibility) and suppliers (users who are willing to repost if certain incentives are given), and maximize the welfare increase accumulated through a given time horizon. We formulate a mathematical model for reposting which captures various factors like click through rates (CTRs), requesters' valuations and suppliers' costs. We formulate the problem of maximizing the welfare increase via judiciously assigning suppliers to requesters from two aspects: (a) “user-centric” and (b) “platform-centric”. The user-centric aspect deals with the situation where requesters and suppliers would collaborate and share valuations and costs. To address the challenge of unknown CTRs, we propose an online learning protocol and achieve a sub-linear regret. The platform-centric aspect corresponds to the scenario where users keep their valuations or costs private. To address the challenges of unknown CTR, valuations and costs, we design an “explore-then-commit” online protocol which can be proved to be truthful. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocols.}

	abstract = {In multi-tenant clouds, off-the-shelf x86 boxes are widely deployed as middleboxes. With the rapid growth of cloud traffic and the migration to NFV deployment in recent years, CPU overloading at middleboxes becomes more of an issue. From our data centers, we observed that the CPU overloading was caused by heavy hitters. To address this issue, we propose MIMIC, a cloud-scale flow backpressure system, implemented onto our existing SmartNIC with FPGA acceleration. MIMIC rate-limits the selected heavy hitters through a new per-flow backpressure protocol and a new heavy-hitter detection system, to protect the other tenants. The detection system is based on hierarchical memory design, leveraging on-chip SRAM and off-chip DRAM, which can handle highly concurrent cloud traffic without the losses of flow information. We extend the design by adding a pre-filtering procedure for rapid detection. To avoid CPU being flooded by FPGA through frequent heavy-hitter reporting, due to their performance disparity, the CPU queries the FPGA on demand. The backpressure protocol is non-invasive to protect tenant privacy and allows controllable rate-limiting through the novel use of ECN and meter tables. The SmartNIC acts as a man in the middle to facilitate heavy-hitter detection and per-flow backpressuring. In a production setting, we observe that MIMIC can react quickly and bring down CPU load to the normal level within 10ms without packet losses.}

These requirements make existing end-to-end transport mechanisms unsuitable for use in the industry verticals that require control-systems type communication. This paper proposes a lightweight, connection-less, and reliable protocol called TinTin. It utilizes the in-network capabilities to compensate for end device constraints. The mechanisms adopted in TinTin aim to reduce the communication overheads associated with well-known connection-oriented protocols.

	abstract = {Distributed GNN training tends to generate huge volumes of communication. To reduce communication cost, the state-of-the-art sampling-based techniques sample and retrieve only a subset of the nodes. However, our analysis shows that current sampling algorithms are still inefficient in network communication for distributed GNN training, which is mainly because of three problems: first, they overlook the locality of the sampled neighbor nodes in the cluster; second, they sample data only at the coarse-grained graph node level; and third, some mechanisms they adopted fall short in distributed scenarios. This paper presents a graph sampling framework (DGS) for distributed GNN training, which effectively reduces network communication cost while preserving the final GNN model accuracy. To achieve this, DGS samples neighborhood information based on the locality of the neighbor nodes in the cluster, and samples data at the levels of not only graph nodes but also node features based on explanation. Specifically, DGS constructs an explanation graph which preserves the relationship between the local graph and remote nodes, and leverages the recently-proposed model explanation technique to design an online explanation scheme that interprets the importance of nodes and features. Evaluation results show that DGS achieves up to 1.25× throughput speedup over the state-of-the-art FastGCN and reduces the communication cost by up to 28.3%, while preserving the final model accuracy almost the same as that of full-batch training.}

We propose the Function-decoupled Segment Routing Mechanism (FDSRM) to optimize the SID list in SRH while ensuring that the routing policy decision would not be affected. FDSRM logically decouples the functions of SID/G-SID according to the function in routing decision and instruction indication. Based on FDSRM, we propose a mathematical optimization framework that leverages the LSTM neural network to optimize the SID allocation to adapt to future traffic. Simulation results indicate that FDSRM can improve the probability of SRH compression by 50.86%, and compress more than 24.50 bytes when the hop count is greater than 20.}

	abstract = {MPTCP provides the basic multipath support for network applications to deliver high throughput and robust communication. However, the original MPTCP is designed with limited extensibility. Various research works have tried to extend MPTCP to attain better performance or richer functionalities. These existing approaches either modify the kernel implementation of MPTCP, which involve considerable engineering efforts and may accidentally introduce security issues, or control MPTCP via user-space tools, which suffer from restricted functionality support. To address this issue, we propose eMPTCP, an easy-to-use framework to fully extend MPTCP without security risks. Internally, eMPTCP has a modular and pluggable model which allows operators to specify a comprehensive MPTCP extension as a chain of sub-policies. eMPTCP further enforces the policies through packet header manipulations. To ensure safety, eMPTCP is implemented using eBPF. Despite the stringent constraints of eBPF, we show that it is possible to implement an elaborated framework for a fully extensible MPTCP. Through verifying MPTCP in a number of real-world cases and extensive experiments, we show that eMPTCP is able to support a wide range of MPTCP extensions, while the overhead of eMPTCP operations in the kernel is in the scale of nanosecond, and the extra processing time accounts for only about 0.63% of flows' transmission time.}

	abstract = {RFID-based Human Gesture Recognition (HGR) has gained much attention and become a promising solution for device-free human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. However, existing RFID sensing suffers from limited scalability as the system needs to be re-trained whenever unseen gestures are introduced, which causes overheads of data collection and re-training. Meanwhile, cross-domain sensing may also fail as the correlation between gestures and induced variations on wireless signals will change when a different domain (i.e., environment or user) is involved. In this paper, we propose a RFID-based HGR system named RF-HGR, which can recognize unseen classes in new domains with only a few labeled samples. Specifically, RF-HGR employs a lightweight few-shot learning (FSL) framework based on fine-tuning domain adaptation to eliminate model re-training overhead. We establish a real-world prototype using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices and the preliminary evaluation results show that RF-HGR with three-, five-, seven-shot learning can recognize novel classes in unseen domains with an accuracy of 50.6%, 65.7% and 72.8% respectively.}

	abstract = {Data upload applications such as streaming of live videos and cloud services bring convenience to our lives. However, the Quality of Experience in wireless networks is often unsatisfactory. One of the reasons is, wireless communication is vulnerable to unpredictable factors such as rapid change of channel and competition of channel resources, leading to hysteresis and inaccuracy when performing a congestion control algorithm. To mitigate this problem, we analyzed the relationship between the real-time length of the NIC driver queue at the sender and the end-to-end transmission performances, and found a strong correlation between them. The reason is, when the wireless link is the first hop of data upload, the bottleneck mostly occurs at this hop, thus causing the accumulation of packets on the NIC driver queue. Based on this observation, we designed QCC, a congestion control algorithm that adjusts the congestion window (cwnd) according to the residual queue length after each round of NIC transmission. Specifically, the cwnd will be quickly reduced when this queue length is large to mitigate congestion, and gradually increased when it is small to increase link utility. By this means, QCC can track the time-varying wireless links quickly and accurately to achieve both high throughput and low latency. We evaluate QCC on both real-world Wi-Fi and cellular network implementations. Our experiment results reveal that QCC can achieve 2.04X lower delays than that of BBR while ensuring the similar link utilization rate as BBR (99% of BBR's throughput).}

	abstract = {Payment channel networks (PCNs) have been designed and utilized to address the scalability challenge and throughput limitation of blockchains. It provides a high-throughput solution for blockchain-based payment systems. However, such “layer-2” blockchain solutions have their own problems: payment channels require a separate deposit for each channel of two users. Thus it significantly locks funds from users into particular channels without the flexibility of moving these funds across channels. In this paper, we proposed Aggregated Payment Channel Network (APCN), in which flexible funds are used as a per-user basis instead of a per-channel basis. To prevent users from misbehaving such as double-spending, APCN includes mechanisms that make use of hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs) to control funds, balances, and payments. The distributed routing protocol in APCN also addresses the congestion problem to further improve resource utilization. Our prototype implementation and simulation results show that APCN achieves significant improvements on transaction success ratio with low routing latency, compared to even the most advanced PCN routing.}

While sketch configurations are guided by theories, the current theoretical guidelines are either impractical or deficient for sketch configurations on emerging programmable switches. To better configure sketches on programmable switches, we (1) systematically analyze the limitations of sketch configuration guidelines on programmable hardware switches (i.e., unguided parameters, accuracy profiles, and resource budgets); (2) propose a generic and practical framework called SketchGuide to automate efficient sketch configurations on programmable switches; (3) implement SketchGuide on a Barefoot Tofino switch and compare SketchGuide to the state-of-the-art sketches by conducting extensive experiments. Our evaluations demonstrate that SketchGuide can automatically configure unguided parameters given resource budgets. SketchGuide reduces the hardware resource footprint by 52.92%-99.28% compared with current guidelines without impacting fidelity.}

	abstract = {Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) have become one of the key techniques to provide long-range, low-power communication for large-scale devices in the Internet of Things. However, LPWAN devices in real deployments (e.g., in buildings and basements) suffer from low-quality links due to signal attenuation, leading to coverage holes and significant deployment overhead. In this work, we propose Ostinato to enable communication for weak links and to enhance the coverage for real deployments of COTS LoRa. The key idea of Ostinato is to transform the original packet to a pseudo packet with repeated symbols and to concentrate the energy of multiple symbols to enhance the signal SNR. To address practical challenges, we reverse engineer the entire coding and modulation process of LoRa and propose a method to generate repeated symbols on COTS LoRa by manipulating input data bits. Thus, Ostinato can be directly used for widely deployed LoRa nodes without hardware modification. We achieve weak packet detection, synchronization, and effective decoding on the receiver side by concentrating energy from multiple symbols with phase offsets. We implement Ostinato on Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and extensively evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that Ostinato achieves an 8.5 dB gain on receiving sensitivity and 2.88× gain on the coverage compared with COTS LoRa.}

	abstract = {Layer-3 load balancing is a key topic in the networking field. It is well acknowledged that flowlet is the most promising solution because of its good trade-off between load balance and packet reordering. However, we find its one significant limitation: it makes the forwarding paths of flows unpredictable. To address this limitation, this paper presents BurstBalancer, a simple yet efficient load balancing system with a sketch, named BalanceSketch. Our design philosophy is doing less changes to keep the forwarding path of most flows fixed, which guides the design of BalanceSketch and balance operations. We have fully implemented BurstBalancer in a small-scale testbed built with Tofino switches, and conducted large-scale NS-2 simulations. Our results show that BurstBalancer achieves 5%∼35% smaller FCT than LetFlow in symmetric topology and up to 30× smaller FCT in asymmetric topology, while 58× fewer flows suffer from path changing.

	abstract = {In recent years, enterprises are increasingly moving from private WANs to hybrid WANs, for the purpose of cost saving, better scalability and improved user experience. To utilize network resource of both private and public networks, existing traffic engineering (TE) solutions for hybrid WANs perform traffic classification at the application level, i.e., sending traffic of high-priority applications to private WANs while letting other traffic go to the Internet. Unfortunately, such a strategy falls short of achieving optimal performance and has inherent limitation in making desired tradeoff between cost and performance. In this paper, we present comboTE, a mixed-link based TE framework to optimize both performance and cost over hybrid WAN. Specifically, comboTE designs a fine-grained TE strategy that considers link(s) from both types of networks at every hop when deciding the routing path for each traffic demand. To address the scalability issues, we leverage Lagrangian relaxation, a decomposition technique for solving large scale integer linear programs, combined with a novel augmented-graph-based approach to derive the most cost-efficient link compositions within a segment. Our comboTE achieves the near-optimal solution with a theoretically proven gap that is better than linear programming relaxation. The experimental results on realistic topologies and traffic matrices show that comboTE scales well and achieves solutions of high quality. Compared to prior TE algorithms, comboTE achieves a solution with tighter gap in limited time, and takes 2.2× less execution time without a time budget.}

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) aims to connect billions of low-date rate and energy-constrained end-devices in the near future. Although many IoT systems have been commercialized, most of them focus on home and body scale applications. To establish a low-cost IoT at the city scale, LoRa Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN) have become attractive in recent years due to their desirable kilometer or even longer communication distance with low energy consumption. However, due to the expensive cost of densely deploying end-nodes, the understanding of LoRa link behavior is still coarse-grained, and hard to fully realize the link dynamics, networking coverage, and localization accuracy of LoRaWAN in an urban environment. This paper shows a fine-grained LoRa link-level measurement via mobile end-nodes. We deploy two gateways and six mobile end-nodes and collect data packets over four months at a\n6×6 k\nm\n2\nurban area. The evaluation mainly focuses on answering three questions: 1) Does a LoRa link stably perform in both spatial and temporal dimensions? 2) How large area can be covered for reliable communication by each gateway in the urban environment? 3) What accuracy can be achieved to localize an end-node through LoRa links? According to our measurement, our key findings are 1) The spatial and temporal behavior of LoRa links is quite dynamic due to the different types of land covers and the frequent micro-environment changes in the urban areas; 2) Each gateway can cover about 11.3 km 2 area and marginal SNR gains (e.g., 2 dB) of LoRa links are efficient enough to enlarge 32.6% coverage area of a gateway; and 3). The median localization error is about 400 m. Without densely deployed LoRa gateways, the SOTA LoRa localization can support road-level localization, even when an end node is close to one of the gateways.}

	abstract = {Multiple Path Transmission Control Protocols (MPTCPs) allow flows to explore path diversity of datacenter networks and multihoming to improve throughput, reliability, and network resource utilization. However, the existing MPTCPs are largely empirical by design and fall short of achieving satisfactory tradeoffs among responsiveness, TCP fairness and throughput. By leveraging the TCP utility and a network-utility-maximization (NUM) solution for concave utilities, in this paper, we derive and implement in Linux kernels two distinct families of NUM-optimal MPTCP protocols, EUTCP (\nγ\n), a function of a rate-scaling vector of the sub-flow rate-scaling coefficients,\nγ\n, and WUTCP (\nω\n), a function of a utility weight vector of the sub-flow weights,\nω\n, respectively. While the former allows resource pooling, the latter does not. We then show that the Semicoupled algorithm and EWTCP are in fact EUTCP(1) and WUTCP\n(1/\nm\n2\n)\n, where\nm\nis the number of sub-flow paths, and hence, are NUM-optimal. The performance of the two families with equal weight and equal rate-scaling coefficient for all sub-flows when coexisting with TCP is also analyzed based on experiments in a testbed. In particular, the test results demonstrate that the family members of EUTCP (\nγ\n) with rate-scaling coefficient in the range of [1, 1.1] outperform three well-known MPTCPs with resource pooling capability, including LIA, OLIA and Balia, in terms of achieving satisfactory tradeoffs among responsiveness, fairness and throughput. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to the existing ones is further confirmed by simulation in a fat-tree datacenter network topology running both long and short flows.}

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in coflow scheduling due to the rise of data-intensive applications. However, existing solutions rely on modifying hosts to obtain coflow information and cooperatively prioritize their packets. Such a host-assisted approach may not work for public data centers and could be problematic when the central controller becomes a bottleneck. In this work, we present PICO, an in-network coflow scheduling system allowing a programmable switch to prioritize coflows in a fully distributed way. In the absence of host cooperation, we develop a pairwise coflow detection scheme that clusters sequentially arrived flows. We further design a data plane pipeline that enables fast feature extraction and efficient coflow size tracking for real-time priority adaptation. The experiments show that our sequential coflow grouping achieves an accuracy of up to 99%. The coflows, on average, complete 1.28× faster than per-flow fair sharing, showing the effectiveness of PICO's distributed in-network scheduling even with no hardware modification and host cooperation.}

	abstract = {The possibility of richer computing capabilities within Internet network elements, often captured as Computing in the Network (COIN), promises performance and flexibility gains to the wider Internet, akin to those seen in recent data center advances. At the same time, moving computation into the network is seemingly at odds with the fundamental end-to-end principle underlying the development of key technologies in the Internet. In this paper, we do not only argue that the latter is not the case, but we also shed light on what ‘in the network’ may or may not entail, aiming to sharpen a possible research agenda for COIN. Taking the transport layer as an example due to its typical end-to-end realization in and importance for today's Internet, we outline key design considerations for evolving towards a COIN-enabled transport capability. By further creating linkages to existing efforts and concepts, we provide possible future directions for the design of protocols for the future Internet.}

	abstract = {Path aware networking (PAN) is an approach that allows endpoints to participate in the end-to-end path selection, letting them choose paths best suited for each application. This approach offers numerous potential benefits including rapid fail-over, concurrent use of parallel paths, and QoS enabled networks, even spanning multiple domains. The dynamic interconnection of different autonomous systems (ASes) in path aware networks offers both challenges and opportunities for network service providers, which in turn provide opportunities for traffic engineering previously not possible. The SCION path-aware network architecture has been designed from the ground up with security in mind, and features a trust structure that can serve as a basis for more dynamic interconnection between ASes. In this paper, we describe a prototype spot market that lets the ASes sell time-limited excess capacity, allowing buyers to divert traffic to cheaper alternatives temporarily. We believe this market allows for new opportunities both in traffic engineering and inter-domain connectivity that have not existed before. The market benefits all parties involved, as the formerly wasted bandwidth is now used, and provides additional revenue—in varying degrees—to all the participating entities.}

	abstract = {To piggyback information, the instantaneous-phase shift (IPS) modulation toggles discrete phases on ambient RF carriers, which is popular with advanced backscatter systems. However, IPS has poor spectrum efficiency. It produces serious spectrum sidelobes and prevents the formation of large networks. In this paper, we propose frequency-phase shift (FPS) modulation, a fine-grained RF switches toggling that modulates carriers with a continuous phase shift. The phase continuity suppresses spectrum sidelobes without disturbing the demodulation results. We first apply FPS to optimize a ZigBee backscatter tag. ZigBee signals, consisting of a non-single-tone header and a single-tone payload, are transmitted as RF carriers. The backscatter tag leverages FPS to modulate the single-tone for phase-continuity data transmission. Further, the tag recycles the non-single-tone header using sub-symbol codeword translation to improve carrier utilization. Through extensive experiments and field studies, we demonstrate that FPS enables ZigBee transmissions with a bandwidth of 2.4 MHz, which is 3x lower than that of Interscatter [1] and much closer to active radios. The system prototype consists of a microchip transmitter, a backscatter tag, and a commodity receiver. Specifically, when the transmitter-to-tag distance is within 5 centimeters, the system enables a goodput of 16.6 kbps at a channel capacity of 16.8 kbps, and the communication distance can be extended to 17 meters.}

However, the current transport layers' APIs are too primitive to accomplish that. Therefore, today's applications are forced to build their customized and complex deadline-aware data delivery mechanisms. In this work, we design Deadline-aware Transport Protocol (DTP) to provide deliver-before-deadline service over the wild Internet. To fulfill the diverse and sometimes conflicting requirements over the fluctuating network, we design the Active-Drop-at-Sender scheduler and adaptive redundancy. We build DTP by extending QUIC, and then develop two applications that utilize DTP. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DTP is easy to use and can bring significant performance improvement (1.2x to 5x) compared to vanilla QUIC.}

	abstract = {With the massive and rapid growth of network traffic, sketching techniques are widely used to estimate a variety of network flow-level metrics, e.g., flow size, top-k flows, and the number of flows. However, how to cope with the constantly changing network environment and achieve high accuracy with limited switch resources is still a challenging problem. Existing studies do not well address the issues of identifying and correcting the inaccurately estimated flows. Therefore, we propose TalentSketch, an adaptive and high-precision hybrid measurement framework based on LSTM. TalentSketch uses LSTM to learn the sketch features with the captured traffic information. It could identify the inaccurately estimated flows with an error-prone flow model and correct them with a well-trained regression model. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the performance of TalentSketch. Experimental results show that, without increasing switch resource overhead, TalentSketch improves the measurement accuracy of different kinds of sketches by 12%∼23%. More importantly, it can track network fluctuations and provide feedback on the overall accuracy of a sketch in real-time.}

	abstract = {In-band network telemetry (INT) enables hop-by-hop fine-grained network monitoring without interacting with the controller at every hop. Existing INT-based network-wide telemetry systems achieve low-overhead monitoring with the non-overlapped path planning algorithms. However, they do not bound the length of the generated probing paths, which may lead to packet loss when the collected telemetry data exceeds the MTU limit. In this paper, we propose an MTU-adaptive path segmentation algorithm to solve this problem. First, we provide two single-path planning algorithms: the INT-optimize algorithm produces a single path that covers the entire network with the lowest southbound communication overhead, and the INT-low-cost algorithm further improves the path planning efficiency of the INT-optimize. By taking the MTU limit into account, we further propose INT-Segment, a novel path segmentation algorithm to split the single long path produced from the previous step into multiple path segments. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed INT-Segment can realize sub-second network-wide telemetry for large-scale networks. It takes less than 2.9ms to calculate the probing paths for an 18-pod FatTree. Compared with the state-of-the-art INT-path, our solution makes the probing path well adapted to the network MTU limit and improves the telemetry efficiency by 10%-94%.}

	abstract = {Network utility maximization (NUM) is a well-studied problem for network traffic management and resource allocation. Because of the inherent decentralization and complexity of networks, most researches develop decentralized NUM algorithms. In recent years, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture has been widely used, especially in cloud networks and inter-datacenter networks managed by large enterprises, promoting the design of centralized NUM algorithms. To cope with the large and increasing number of flows in such SDN networks, existing researches about centralized NUM focus on the scalability of the algorithm with respect to the number of flows, however the efficiency is ignored. In this paper, we focus on the SDN scenario, and derive a centralized, efficient and scalable algorithm for the NUM problem. By the designing of a smooth utility function and a smooth penalty function, we formulate the NUM problem with a smooth objective function, which enables the use of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. We prove that the proposed method has\nO(d/\nt\n2\n)\nconvergence rate, which is the fastest with respect to the number of iterations\nt\n, and our method is scalable with respect to the number of flows\nd\nin the network. Experiments show that our method obtains accurate solutions with less iterations, and achieves close-to-optimal network utility.}

	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has gained large popularity as an important infrastructure of Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, researchers have integrated the TCP/IP stack with the BLE stack for interoperability, supporting more upper-layer protocols and applications. However, these works gain extremely low TCP goodput due to connection event inefficiency when TCP cooperates with BLE. How to improve the performance is an urgent problem. This paper proposes TCPle, a performant TCP-over-BLE stack that presents a novel adaption layer design bridging the gap between TCP and BLE without violating their specifications. TCPle improves the efficiency of connection events significantly by two fundamental mechanisms: connection event length adaption and connection event maintenance which correspond to the two root causes of low goodput. The connection event length adaption mechanism predicts the data size to send based on an online learning method and updates the connection event capacity adaptively. This mechanism avoids the long waiting time of ACK to back to the TCP sender. The connection event maintenance mechanism prefetches data packets to maintain the connection event. This mechanism avoids the long waiting time of data packets when out of the sender after the ACK is back. We implemented TCPle on nRF52840 DK with RIOT OS based on lwIP stack and NimBLE stack and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Results show that TCPle 1) is lightweight and well-suited for resource-constrained IoT devices; 2) improves TCP goodput by up to 101.6% compared with other existing TCP-over-BLE stacks.}

	abstract = {In-band network telemetry (INT) delivers high-precision network monitoring by collecting device-internal states entirely on the data plane. For rapid congestion awareness and network troubleshooting, it is necessary to conduct network-wide telemetry by generating multiple monitoring paths covering the entire network graph. Solving the optimal path planning problem used the eulerian trail initially at a time complexity of\nO(k(3E+V−15k/2))\n. For mega-scale data center networks, such a high complexity is unacceptable because the algorithm cannot adapt well to occasional topology changes. In this work, we propose improved INT-path and INT-react, two refined path planning algorithms with a much reduced time complexity of only\nO(E)\n. Furthermore, INT-react also considers balanced path generation to reduce the longest path length for synchronized collection of telemetry data from each monitoring path. The evaluation shows that on average it costs 2.10s for the improved INT-path to solve the optimal path planning for a network of 9500 switches, while the computation is completed within only 0.283s on average for INT-react. In addition, INT-react reduces the longest path length. INT-react's path planning is so fast that it promptly reacts to topology changes and is ready to be deployed in mega-scale production networks.}

	abstract = {Metarouting models routing protocols in the form of an algebraic structure called routing algebra. It aims to help designing or validating routing protocols. Most research work on routing algebras have been applied to routing protocols used in networks having a single addressing and forwarding protocol. In this context, some of the basic algebraic structures used are semirings. In this paper, we define a new algebraic structure for dealing with networks containing multiple forwarding protocols, which may induce many (and possibly nested) tunnels. We widely generalize the semiring structure for modeling the routing problem with automatic tunneling. We define a new model of routing algebra with tunneling. It is defined as a semi-direct product of two structures, the well-know shortest paths algebra and a new proposed valid paths algebra. We show that it has a fixed point and we prove the iterative convergence to the optimal solution of the valid shortest paths problem.}

	abstract = {Throughput is one of the key performance indicators in backscatter communication systems. Existing works either have limited throughput or modify the transmitter or receiver to fit the backscatter tag, thereby causing incompatibility with commodity radios. In this paper, we present SubScatter, which realizes a high throughput and keeps compatibility at the same time. For high throughput, SubScatter uses one CCK-modulated 802.11b WiFi symbol to carry eight tag bits by manipulating the phase of the backscattered signal in eight-time slots of a symbol separately. For compatibility with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) radios, SubScatter leverages only the physical service data unit (PSDU) to recover the backscatter modulation in which the tag bits are conveyed. And still, to fit the sub-symbol backscatter modulation, SubScatter calculates the Hamming distance between the binary envelope provided by the synchronization circuit and a reference sequence in real-time for synchronization. Extensive experiments in our prototype have proven the effectiveness of SubScatter. SubScatter achieves a throughput of about 11× over state-of-the-art backscatter systems compatible with COTS radios. The Hamming-distance-based synchronization outperforms the design of merely detecting the change of signal power and helps reduce the bit error rate from over 10% to below 1%.}

	abstract = {The congestion control strategy plays an essential role in the high-speed datacenter network. It aims to deliver low latency, high throughput network service. RTT-based congestion control leverages advanced NIC hardware to identify accumulated queuing delay of the end-to-end path. Sender adjusts the sending rate or congestion window if the delay exceeds a predetermined value, i.e., target delay. Therefore, setting the target delay is the key for RTT-based congestion control strategies. We provide a comprehensive study of the impact of target delay on recent RTT-based congestion control strategies, and demonstrate that a fixed inappropriate target value can lead to low bandwidth utilization or high latency. We then propose a practical queuing target updating approach to solve this problem. The proposed method maintains a shared near-optimal queuing target at the receiving host. We leverage the widely supported ECN flag to estimate the empty state of switch queue instead of indicating congestion, which requires no complicated threshold configuration. We have integrated the dynamic queuing target updating approach into the state-of-the-art RTT-based congestion strategy, SWIFT, and named the design RET. Test-bed experiments and simulations in the large-scale network with synthesized traffic of real workloads show that RET can achieve up to 1.5x and 3.6x lower tail latency than SWIFT and DCQCN, respectively. This paper provides a deep understanding on tuning target delay for RTT-based congestion control algorithms in datacenter networks.}

	abstract = {As a representative technology of low power wide area network, LoRa has been widely adopted to many applications. A fundamental question in LoRa is how to improve its reception quality in ultra-low SNR scenarios. Different from existing studies that exploit either spatial or temporal correlation for LoRa reception recovery, this paper jointly leverages the fine-grained spatial-temporal correlation among multiple gateways. We exploit the spatial and temporal correlation in LoRa packets to jointly process received signals so that the fine-grained offsets including Central Frequency Offset (CFO), Sampling Time Offset (STO) and Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO) are well compensated, and signals from multiple gateways are combined coherently. Moreover, a deep learning based soft decoding scheme is developed to integrate the energy distribution of each symbol into the decoder to further enhance the coding gain in a LoRa packet. We evaluate our work with commodity LoRa devices (i.e., Semtech SX1278) and gateways (i.e., USRP-B210) in both indoor and outdoor environments. Extensive experiment results show that our work achieves 4.6dB higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 1.5× lower bit error rate (BER) compared with existing approaches.}

	abstract = {Recently, federated learning (FL) has received intensive research because of its ability in preserving data privacy for scattered clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. Commonly, a parameter server (PS) is deployed for aggregating model parameters contributed by different clients. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is upgraded from FL which allows clients to aggregate model parameters with their neighbours directly. DFL is particularly feasible for vehicular networks as vehicles communicate with each other in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner. However, due to the restrictions of vehicle routes and communication distances, it is hard for individual vehicles to sufficiently exchange models with others. Data sources contributing to models on individual vehicles may not diversified enough resulting in poor model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose the DFL-DDS (DFL with diversified Data Sources) algorithm to diversify data sources in DFL. Specifically, each vehicle maintains a state vector to record the contribution weight of each data source to its model. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector. To boost the convergence of DFL, a vehicle tunes the aggregation weight of each data source by minimizing the KL divergence of its state vector, and its effectiveness in diversifying data sources can be theoretically proved. Finally, the superiority of DFL-DDS is evaluated by extensive experiments (with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets) which demonstrate that DFL-DDS can accelerate the convergence of DFL and improve the model accuracy significantly compared with state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Understanding link-level performance is key to assuring the quality of cloud-based and OTT services, optimal path selection, robust network operations and beyond. However, direct measurement of each link not only incurs high overhead at the Internet-scale but also is infeasible due to lack of access to network measurement information beyond AS boundaries and functional limitations at relay nodes. Although network tomography is well suited, existing approaches are insufficient due to their unrealistic assumptions with respect to stability, controllability, and visibility. Motivated by this, we propose PAINT, an online iterative algorithm that estimates and refines link-level performance metrics based on path-level measurement. In PAINT, the link metrics are iteratively estimated by minimizing their least square error (LSE) and calibrated based on the comparison of weight between the estimated shortest paths (SPs) and best-known paths from end-to-end path measurements. The key insight is that when there is inconsistency between these paths, then weights of links on the estimated SP are likely mis-estimated, triggering a further round of estimation to refine the estimated link metrics. Evaluation of PAINT, focusing on link delay estimation, using four different real network topologies and two real-world measurement datasets (including one we collected) shows that relative to existing approaches, it yields up to 3x gain in absolute link delay estimation accuracy and improves decisions dependent on link delay estimation by up to 5x in relative error.}

	abstract = {In recent years, quantitative verification concerning network availability has received increasing attention due to its practical importance in network management. Existing work extends upon qualitative verification and tries to answer whether a network would have any link overload under failures and dynamic traffic. The simple yes-or-no question falls short of accurately characterizing the robustness of a network under uncertainties, which the operators are in dire need of. Thus, we argue that it is necessary to design a probabilistic framework to analyze network availability comprehensively. We propose Pita, a novel network analysis framework that outputs the overall probability of the network being unavailable under a range of failure scenarios and traffic demands. We formalize the problem and show that it is #P-hard which does not admit deterministic approximation solutions. We further develop an improved randomized approximation that exploits the structural property of our problem to reduce the computational cost of the so-called boundary oracle procedure, a key bottleneck of the approximation, without any accuracy loss. Evaluation with real topologies shows that Pita provides up to 2.25x speedup over state-of-the-art solutions, and can be effectively used in many network management tasks such as identifying high-risk failure scenarios, and aiding robust traffic engineering design.}
