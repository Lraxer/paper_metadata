	abstract = {Key-value lookup functions have been widely applied to network applications, including FIBs, load balancers, and content distributions. Two key performance requirements of a lookup algorithm are high throughput and small memory cost. One limitation of existing fast network lookup algorithms is that they require multiple independent and uniform hash functions, which cost high computation time and might not be available on existing hardware network devices. Recently developed learned model hashing (LMH) proposes to use a linear machine learning model to replace hash functions to avoid hash computation, but they are not optimized for memory cost. We propose a novel network lookup method called Parrot hashing, which uses a learned model to distribute keys into different buckets and applies a simple perfect hashing method to resolve the collisions of the keys in a bucket. Parrot can be implemented with only one CRC8, which is available on all network devices. We implement Parrot in three prototypes: a software program on end hosts, a software switch, and a FIB running on a hardware programmable switch. The experimental results show that Parrot achieves the highest lookup throughput on all three prototypes, compared to existing methods. Its memory cost is also significantly lower than that of LMH.}

	abstract = {Damage or relocation of network devices necessitates the replacement of devices. Additionally, manufacturers of devices may also change due to factors such as price, policies, and functional limitations. This brings great needs of converting existing configurations to fix new devices and ensuring consistent network policy behaviors, which is configuration translation. Manually translating requires network administrators to possess significant configuration expertise and to spend extreme time translating thousands of commands for a core device. Therefore, we propose ConfigTrans, a novel configuration translation method for commands with and without parameters based on constraint solving and large language models (LLMs), respectively. For commands with parameters, we explore constraints about parameters, commands, and format limitations, and design a heuristic algorithm to solve them. For commands without parameters, we utilize an LLM to find the translation. The most likely several commands are selected based on semantic similarity, and the final result and keywords in it are chosen by the LLM. To meet the requirements of the view, the result commands are arranged while supplementing missing higherview commands. Experimental results show that our method achieves an accuracy rate of 82.47 % for translating commands with parameters and 75.5 % for commands without parameters.}

	abstract = {Today's Internet frequently suffers from unreliable packet forwarding and security vulnerabilities, while it largely depends on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that obscures routing complexities from end-hosts. Path-Aware Networking (PAN) is a novel paradigm that aims to overcome BGP's limitations by offering end-hosts control over packet routing. However, an optimal path choice based on PAN requires realtime performance data about the different path options. Programmable data planes and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enable to add real-time telemetry data to user packets. However, existing implementations are limited to single administrative domains, lacking the security and privacy required for interdomain telemetry. This paper proposes the first hardware implementation of Inter-Domain In-band Network Telemetry (ID-INT), extending the P4-based SCION border router targeting Tofino 2. Leveraging SCION's path-aware features and robust security mechanisms, like the DRKey system for secure key derivation, our ID-INT implementation on Tofino ensures telemetry data authenticity and integrity. We demonstrate the benefits of ID-INT on Tofino by evaluating the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport Protocol (DMTP) as an example application utilizing ID-INT data to improve its responsiveness to network conditions. Our testbed experiments show that ID-INT enables DMTP to dynamically adjust the sending rate based on instantaneous queue length data, highlighting ID-INT's practical benefits in enhancing an application's performance.}

	abstract = {Ensuring reliable operation of cloud networks is critical for cloud service providers to guarantee quality of service for tenants. A promising solution is to design a high-fidelity cloud network validation platform that proactively validates the correctness of all operations before implementing changes to the production network. However, the tight coupling between physical and virtual networks in the cloud poses challenges to achieving high-fidelity cloud network validation. Existing network validation platforms focus primarily on traditional physical networks, while ignoring virtual network validation. Regrettably, neglecting the combined validation of physical and virtual networks will result in inaccurate evaluations. To bridge this gap, we present HifiCNet, a high-fidelity platform that concurrently validates both physical and virtual networks. HifiCNet designs an orchestrator to elegantly coordinate the interaction between physical and virtual networks in the cloud and innovatively adopts an emulator-simulator hybrid architecture to ensure high fidelity and scalability for cloud network validation. Through extensive evaluation based on real topologies and traffic traces, we show that HifiCNet enables high-fidelity validation of cloud network configurations, services, and exceptions. Notably, HifiCNet can use 38 servers to establish a physical network comprising 10k hosts, and a virtual network consisting of 200 k virtual machines.}

	abstract = {Research in the area of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection is of paramount importance in the field of network security. Many existing studies employ static evaluation methods that fail to account for the reduction in accuracy due to the impact of inference latency on the timeliness of classification results. Furthermore, these studies frequently rely on simulated datasets for experimentation, which often lack the complexity and challenge of real-world attacks. These limitations significantly hinder the applicability of such research in practical scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an evaluation methodology for real-time DDoS attack detection incorporating inference latency considerations. Additionally, we have developed a challenging DDoS dataset named THU-DDoS2024 and conducted experiments across four classification algorithms. This novel evaluation method and the newly generated dataset are integrated into an evaluation framework named E-DDoS. Leveraging E-DDoS, the “Intelligent Classification of High-Speed Network Traffic (ICNT)”, Grand Challenge was initiated. This event aims to motivate both academic and industrial sectors to delve into high-speed traffic classification tasks, thereby enhancing the applicability of research outputs to real-world applications.}

	abstract = {With the large-scale deployment and application of IPv6, IPv6 network measurements will become increasingly important. However, a special type of IPv6 prefix called Fully Responsive Prefix (FRP) is having a significant impact on IPv6 measurement campaigns, which is defined as all addresses under a prefix responding to scans. Obviously, there cannot be a real responder behind each of these addresses. To reveal the current status and impact of Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, we propose for the first time an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, Luori, which transforms the active probing process under IPv6 huge prefix space (potential range of prefix presence) into a dynamic search process in a tree based on reinforcement learning, achieving efficient probing of arbitrary routing prefixes. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K largest FRPs in a single Internet-wide probing with 11 M budget, covering\n1.5×\n10\n30\naddress space, which is\n10\n6\n×\nthat of existing methods. More importantly, after six months of Internet-wide probing, we have found 516 K largest FRPs, which covers\n1.3×\n10\n33\naddress space and 795 ASes, making it the largest publicly known FRP list. Based on this list, we screen out\n20%\nof the addresses covered by FRPs from a well-known IPv6 active address dataset. Furthermore, we further analyze and find that the distribution of these FRPs is extensive and their implementation methods are diverse, which can provide beneficial references for the practical application of FRPs. We also make this list publicly available and maintain it long-term for use and study by relevant researchers.}

	abstract = {The imminent advent of Quantum Computers poses a significant threat to the cryptographic algorithms supporting the public key infrastructure (PKI) of widely used communication protocols. High Performance Computing (HPC) data centers among other interested parties are well aware of the catastrophic consequences quantum attacks could have on their PKI and are consequently transitioning to Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) methods, despite the substantial overhead this introduces for handling incoming network packets. This work addresses the transition to PQC within the context of the Cloud-Edge Continuum by integrating the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library into the accelerated strongSwan developed by Mellanox for Data Processing Units (DPUs). This integration offloads cryptographic operations from central servers to data DPUs distributed across the cloud-edge continuum. Our solution ensures quantum security by providing PQ authentication through CRYSTALS-Dilithium or CRYSTALS-FALCON, PQ key exchanges via CRYSTALS-Kyber, and confidential data transmission using AES-256. Additionally, the deployment of this implementation on DPUs helps reduce the computational load on both HPC data centers and edge devices, promoting more efficient and secure operations across the entire cloud-edge continuum.}

	abstract = {Large constellations of Earth Observation Low Earth Orbit satellites collect enormous amounts of image data every day. This amount of data needs to be transferred to data centers for processing via ground stations. Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) emerges as a new cloud service to offer satellite operators easy access to a network of ground stations on a pay-per-use basis. However, renting ground station and data center resources still incurs considerable costs, especially for large satellite constellations. The current practice of sticking to a single GSaaS provider also suffers high data latency and low robustness to weather variability due to limited ground station availability. To address these limitations, we propose SkyGS, a system that schedules both communication and computation by federating GSaaS and cloud computing services across multiple cloud providers. We formulate the resulting problem as a system cost minimization problem with a long-term data latency threshold constraint. In SkyGS, we apply Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time optimization problems that do not require prior knowledge. As the decomposed problem is still of exponential complexity, we transform it into a bipartite graph-matching problem and employ the Hungarian algorithm to solve it. We analyze the performance theoretically and evaluate SkyGS using realistic simulations based on real-world satellites, ground stations, and data centers data. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SkyGS can achieve cost savings by up to 63% & reduce average data latency by up to 95%.}

	abstract = {TCP congestion control uses end-to-end delay and packet discard information to control the transmission rate. In the wireless LAN, there is a time lag between TCP congestion control and the transmission rate control of the wireless LAN interfaces, and there is no coordination between the respective controls. Thus, congestion control corresponding to the current state of the wireless network can be achieved by shortening this time lag. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to control the congestion window by detecting changes in the transmission rate of the wireless LAN interfaces. Our proposed method enables to control congestion windows size by using data link layer information, instead of using only transport layer information. This paper verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by network simulator ns-3.40.}

	abstract = {The rapidly-increasing computing power of GPUs has rendered the I/O subsystem a bottleneck for distributed deep learning (DL) training. Currently, substantial data preprocessing work (e.g., decoding) has to be conducted on CPUs for a wide range of training scenarios such as computer vision (CV) and audio. Unfortunately, the involvement of training nodes' host memory and/or CPUs on the critical path of loading data to GPUs incurs significant GPU stalls in modern RDMA training clusters, because CPUs are much slower than GPUs and the connection from PCIe switches to host memory tends to suffer from incast problems. Moreover, this also incurs high CPU usage and resource contention, which consequently causes data loading performance variation and stragglers. This paper presents KSpeed, a novel data provisioning framework for large-scale RDMA training clusters. As many data preprocessing tasks need to be done by CPUs, KSpeed organizes host memory and CPU resources in the cluster to build a disaggregated memory/CPU pool, where the nodes can read raw input data from backend storage to their host memory, preprocess the data by their CPUs if necessary, and write cached/preprocessed data (on demand) directly to the training workers' GPU memory to minimize GPU stalls. KSpeed leverages the multi-rail RDMA network to eliminate unnecessary memory copies, interference, and congestion. Evaluation on a 96-GPU cluster shows that KSpeed delivers 5.4 \\times \\sim 100 \\times higher data loading performance over the state-of-the-art designs (DPP and Alluxio). KSpeed achieves near-linear scalability as the GPU number increases from 8 to 512.}

However, current fingerprinting methods such as Nmap still heavily rely on manual probe crafting, requiring experts with domain knowledge and leading to inefficiencies and potential oversights. This paper introduces pFuzz, an automatic network protocol fingerprint discovery system utilizing difference-guided fuzzing, to address the challenge of the vast search space inherent in fingerprinting. We propose a difference tree to model the nested recursive condition structure of network protocols and a packet oracle map to capture and utilize multifield relationships revealed by value co-occurrence. Our evaluation of pFuzz on the widely used TCP/IP protocol demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency on discovering fingerprints.}

	abstract = {Early decision-making at the network device is crucial for network security. This entails moving beyond traditional forwarding functions towards more intelligent network devices. One possible strategy to speed up decision-making is to incorporate intelligent traffic analysis functionality directly into the data plane, such that traffic can be analyzed before forwarding. Integrating Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) models into the data plane enables quicker processing and reduced reliance on the control plane. We address the development of an AI/ML-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) where network devices autonomously make security decisions or defer to an expert oracle, relying on in-band and off-band traffic analysis. Programmable devices, such as those using P4, are essential to enable these functionalities and allow for network device retraining to adapt to changing traffic patterns. We introduce HALIDS, a prototype for in-band AI/ML-IDS using P4, complemented with off-band oracles which support in-network ML-driven classification with more confident classifications, targeting an active learning logic for more accurate in-band analysis. We implement HALIDS using the open source software switch BMv2, and show its operation with real traffic traces publicly available. Evaluation results show that the proposed system is sound and could be implemented in a real network as an efficient and highly adaptive security mechanism.}

	abstract = {Video stream has become the largest part of the Internet traffic, and video Quality of Experience (QoE) is an important factor affecting the overall QoE of Internet users. Accurate measurement of video \\mathbf{Q o E} from the perspective of traffic can help network operators to better plan network resources and improve user retention. To accurately measure video QoE through traffic, multiple factors need to be considered, with stalling being a significant one. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is an indicator that quantifies video QoE. Traditionally, labeling MOS for videos requires subjective quality assessment experiments, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Second, the statistical features used by traditional machine learning methods are difficult to represent the stalling events in video steams, leading to inaccurate MOS measurements. Therefore, a number of past studies only estimate the indirect metrics that affect MOS, such as resolution and bitrate. In this paper, we use the parametric model ITU-T P. 1203 to automatically label MOS for videos. And we propose a two-stage approach to accurately measure MOS from video traffic. First, we introduce a stalling detection algorithm to identify stalling events from HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) traffic. Then, we use these stalling events to produce secondary features and combine them with other statistical video stream features to establish a machine learning model for direct MOS measuring. Experiments show that our proposed method reduces the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of MOS estimation from 0.455 to 0.406 compared to the conventional method.}

	abstract = {We show how to utilize machine learning approaches to improve sliding window algorithms for approximate frequency estimation problems, under the “algorithms with predictions” framework. In this dynamic environment, previous learning-augmented algorithms are less effective, since properties in sliding window resolution can differ significantly from the properties of the entire stream. Our focus is on the benefits of predicting and filtering out items with large next arrival times – that is, there is a large gap until their next appearance – from the stream, which we show improves the memory-accuracy tradeoffs significantly. We provide theorems that provide insight into how and by how much our technique can improve the sliding window algorithm, as well as experimental results using real-world data sets. Our work demonstrates that predictors can be useful in the challenging sliding window setting.}

	abstract = {The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) remains susceptible to prefix hijacks due to its trust-based nature and lack of default robust authentication mechanisms. Prefix hijacks are unintentional or malicious announcements of prefixes allocated to other ASes. Although prefix hijacks are primarily associated with misconfigurations, they remain a significant security threat. For instance, the recent hijacking and route leak incident involving Cloudflare made their DNS resolver unreachable for some networks for about 8 hours. Some ASes perform hijacks frequently and for longer duration. We revisited these “serial hijackers” in 2024 and validated some of the potential serial hijackers with external data. However, neither the original study from 2019 nor ours dug deeper to understand the impact and goal of serial hijackers. This study fills this gap and shows that 22.9 \\% of the announcements were RPKI-invalid, raising new questions about the intent of the hijack. Finally, we show that these invalid announcements still reach many networks on the Internet, demonstrating that many ASes are not doing RPKI route origin validation, thereby compromising the Internet's stability and security.}

	abstract = {Distributed training (DT) has emerged as a solution to address the growing computational resource demands of training large-scale machine learning models. To meet this need, major cloud providers typically build GPU clusters to accommodate DT jobs. Specifically, for an incoming DT job request, cloud providers need to determine in which GPUs place workers (i.e., worker placement). Existing approaches usually place workers on as few idle machines as possible to minimize communication time. However, this scheme will lead to resource fragmentation problem, which degrades the efficiency of the GPU cluster and increases training costs for cloud providers. In this paper, we propose Titan, a novel worker placement scheme that mitigates the influence of resource fragmentation by enhancing the utilization of non-idle machines. Titan formulates a multi-objectives non-linear optimization problem that incorporates the collective communication constraint and proves its NP-hardness. To solve the problem, Titan presents an effective submodular-based greedy algorithm with a tight approximation ratio (1-\\frac{1}{e}). We evaluate Titan with a large-scale simulation employing real-world job traces and a small-scale testbed consisting of 8 servers with 32 logical GPUs. Experimental results show that Titan can achieve near-optimal training throughput while improving the efficiency of the cluster by 74.9% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.}

However, PS encounters challenges with the “incast” issue, while RAR struggles with problems caused by the long dependency chain. The emerging In-network Aggregation (INA) has been proposed to integrate with PS to mitigate its incast issue. However, such PS-based INA has poor incremental deployment abilities as it requires replacing all the switches to show significant performance improvement, which is not costeffective. In this study, we present the incorporation of INA capabilities into RAR, called RAR with In-Network Aggregation (Rina), to tackle both the problems above. Rina features its agent-worker mechanism. When an INA-capable ToR switch is deployed, all workers in this rack run as one abstracted worker with the help of the agent, resulting in both excellent incremental deployment capabilities and better throughput. We conducted extensive testbed and simulation evaluations to substantiate the throughput advantages of Rina over existing DDL training synchronization structures. Compared with the state-of-the-art PS-based INA methods ATP, Rina can achieve more than \\mathbf{5 0 \\%}\nthroughput with the same hardware cost.}

	abstract = {Event streaming systems (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar) are a popular substrate for ingesting data with low latency from continuous data sources, such as sensors, cameras, or server logs. Due to the sheer amount of data being stored as data streams, several systems are incorporating storage tiering as a core feature. However, in some cases, the design of the streaming system assumes a reliable connection with the external storage to offload data. This may not be the case when deploying streaming pipelines in the Cloud-Edge Continuum. In this paper, we evaluate deploying a streaming storage system with integrated data tiering (Pravega) in the CloudEdge Continuum. We identify that while Pravega provides good 10 performance, extended unavailability of the long-term storage service may impact stream data ingestion. This can be problematic in Edge use cases with stringent streaming ingestion and processing requirements. To mitigate this problem, we explore the concept of multi-tier long-term storage in Pravega. We implement this concept by integrating an ephemeral tiered storage system (GEDS) to augment Pravega with advanced data tiering mechanisms. Our preliminary results show that GEDS can exploit multiple storage tiers that increase by 3.8 x\nthe tolerance of the streaming system to long-term storage unavailability.}

	abstract = {The centralized control plane characteristic of Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes it a prime target for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. A significant issue in network traffic data is the severe imbalance between background traffic and various types of DDoS attack traffic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel DDoS detection model based on single-class cluster oversampling and weighted ensemble method. Initially, we design a multi-strategy feature selection using variance inflation factor and recursive feature elimination. Next, we construct a single-class cluster model based on the spatial distribution of samples, and create minority class samples independently within each cluster. Finally, detection results are determined using the weight vector of each base classifier in ensemble learning. The proposed DDoS detection model's performance is validated through simulations of various DDoS attack scenarios in an SDN environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy exhibits superior performance, showing improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to state-of-the-art techniques.}

	abstract = {Recent work shows that programmable switches can effectively detect attack traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks in the midst of high-volume network traffic. However, these techniques primarily rely on sampling or sketch-based data structures, which can only be used to approximate the characteristics of dominant flows in the network. As a result, such techniques are unable to effectively detect low-volume attacks that stealthily add only a few packets to the network. Our work explores how the combination of programmable switches, Smart network interface cards, and hosts can enable fine-grained analysis of every flow in a network, even those with only a small number of packets. We focus on analyzing packets at the start of each flow, as those packets often can help indicate whether a flow is benign or suspicious. We propose a unified architecture that spans the full programmable dataplane to take advantage of the strengths of each type of device. We are developing new filter data structures to efficiently track flows on the switch, dataplane-based communication protocols to quickly coordinate between devices, and caching approaches on the SmartNIC that help minimize the traffic load reaching the host. Our preliminary prototype can handle the full pipe bandwidth of 1.4 Tbps of traffic entering the Tofino switch, forward only 20 Gbps to the SmartNIC, and minimize the traffic load to 5 Gbps reaching the host due to our efficient flow filter, packet batching, and SmartNIC-based cache.}

	abstract = {Containers have become the de facto choice for major cloud services. Meanwhile, with demands for extremely high performance, data centers have widely adopted RDMA for their online services. RDMA virtualization is the critical technology that enables RDMA for containers. Hybrid RDMA virtualization leverages the software flexibility in the control path, and keeps the native performance in the data path. Thus, it is the best choice for RDMA virtualization. State-of-the-art hybrid RDMA virtualization cannot address containerspecific problems. This paper proposes DockRDMA, the first hybrid RDMA virtualization solution for containerized clouds. DockRDMA develops several mechanisms, including embedding physical addresses in virtual ones to provide efficient address translation, hybrid network policy enforcement at scale, a general virtual RDMA NIC initialization method to be compatible with all container platforms, and namespace checking to protect the RDMA NIC instances. Evaluation results show that DockRDMA provides bare-metal RDMA performance in the data path, and almost native communication setup time in the control path. Compared with the state-of-the-art hybrid virtualization technology, DockRDMA reduces Hadoop job completion time by 6%. It offers seamless integration with existing container platforms, protects critical information of RDMA NIC instances, and exhibits excellent scalability to meet diverse network policies required by different containers.}

	abstract = {Network traffic understanding is crucial to providing high-quality network services and protecting network security. However, due to the growing complexity of networks and the rising proportion of encrypted traffic, existing methods for network traffic understanding face severe challenges. Traditional approaches rely on manually designed features or require a large amount of labeled data, while pre-trained models offer new possibilities. Nevertheless, existing pre-trained models have the following limitations: (1) Their inputs only contain features from the packet content, neglecting temporal information about network dynamics. (2) Their pre-training targets only focus on static characteristics of the data stream without understanding the process of the network transmission. This paper presents the Pre-trained model for network Traffic Understanding (PTU), an innovative model that employs self-supervised pre-training to address the challenges of network traffic understanding. In PTU, we design a traffic representation scheme that integrates static packet content and network dynamics into a unified input space. Furthermore, we propose a pre-training method that includes four tailored pre-training targets. This approach enables PTU to capture both static and dynamic characteristics of network traffic from massive amounts of unlabeled data, thereby achieving enhanced performance in downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Extensive experiments confirm PTU's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In traffic classification tasks, PTU achieves an F1 score of over \\mathbf{0. 9 9} and secures a more than \\mathbf{1 0 \\%} improvement in accuracy in the most challenging task of encrypted application classification.}

However, NB-IoT, another critical LPWAN technology, has not seen similar growth in its research community due to the lack of a functional and flexible software-defined radio (SDR) implementation. To address this gap, we present SoftNB, the first fully functional physical layer SDR implementation for NB-IoT. SoftNB conforms to the latest 3GPP standards and features an efficient and effective signal processing pipeline to mitigate time, frequency, and phase offsets during transmission and reception. Additionally, SoftNB is compatible with various SDR platforms, including USRP, HackRF One, and RTL-SDR Dongle. Extensive evaluations of SoftNB demonstrate its superior performance. Compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, SoftNB achieves an 8\\times\nreduction in Block Error Rate (BLER) when the number of repetitions is set to 4 at a distance of 450 meters.}

This simulation-based framework allows for flexible integration of survivability metrics, evaluation of different topologies, and assessment of protocol and architectural changes. With several illustrative examples, we show the effectiveness of our proposed testbench and make a case for stress testing as a viable approach to evaluating the survivability of inter-domain routing against evolving challenges.}

	abstract = {Many proposals have demonstrated the efficiency advantages of software-defined networking (SDN) in managing data center networks. Common practices employ centralized traffic engineering (TE) in the SDN control plane to optimize load balancing and throughput. Meanwhile, for high availability purposes, the control plane is partitioned to ensure the impact of a single faulty controller is contained. However, the interaction between these two aspects is often overlooked. In particular, we show that the current control plane partitioning approach leads to imbalanced link loads and degraded application performance. To address this issue, we propose virtual slicing, a new control plane partitioning scheme. Virtual slicing achieves desirable traffic engineering performance while retaining the availability guarantees from the current approach. Virtual slicing is implemented and evaluated with real-world and synthetic traffic traces on production spine-free data center networks. Results show that virtual slicing reduces tail link utilizations by up to 28.4 %, and improves flow completion times by up to 36 %.}

	abstract = {Identifying heavy hitters and estimating the frequencies of flows are fundamental tasks in various network domains. Existing approaches to this challenge can broadly be categorized into two groups, hashing-based and competing-counter-based. The Count-Min sketch is a standard example of a hashing-based algorithm, and the Space Saving algorithm is an example of a competing-counter algorithm. Recent works have explored the use of machine learning to enhance algorithms for frequency estimation problems, under the algorithms with prediction framework. However, these works have focused solely on the hashing-based approach, which may not be best for identifying heavy hitters. In this paper, we present the first learned competing-counterbased algorithm, called LSS, for identifying heavy hitters, top k, and flow frequency estimation that utilizes the well-known Space Saving algorithm. We provide theoretical insights into how and to what extent our approach can improve upon Space Saving, backed by experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our evaluation demonstrates that LSS can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Space Saving in identifying heavy hitters, top k, and estimating flow frequencies.}

	abstract = {Emerging satellite Internet constellations such as SpaceX's Starlink will deploy thousands of broadband satellites and construct Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks (LSNs) in space, significantly expanding the boundaries of today's terrestrial Internet. However, due to the unique global LEO dynamics, satellite routers will inevitably pass through uncontrolled areas, suffering from security threats. It should be important for satellite network operators (SNOs) to enable verifiable riskavoidance routing to identify path anomalies. In this paper, we present STARVERI, a novel network path verification framework tailored for emerging LSNs. STARVERI addresses the limitations of existing crypto-based and delay-based verification approaches and accomplishes efficient and accurate path verification by: (i) adopting a dynamic relay selection mechanism deployed in SNO's operation center to judiciously select verifiable relays for each communication pair over LSNs; and (ii) incorporating a lightweight path verification algorithm to dynamically verify each segment path split by distributed relays. We build an LSN simulator based on real constellation information and the results demonstrate that STARVERI can significantly improve the path verification accuracy and achieve lower router overhead compared with existing approaches.}

However, such advances thriving in private data centers are rarely deployed in public-facing data centers. A major challenge is synchronizing optimization signals—such as flow sizes, server assignments, and load information—with the traffic they are intended to optimize, especially across networks controlled by different entities. In this paper, we propose CloudCookie, a versatile signal carrier within Internet protocols that ensures bidirectional signal presence without client-side cooperation. To exemplify CloudCookie's benefits on public-facing data center traffic, we design a set of easy-to-deploy data center infrastructures, including load balancers and switches, to leverage application layer awareness and enable efficient flow packet scheduling and load balancing. Our evaluation shows that these advances synergistically optimize the 99th percentile of flow completion time by up to 20 x for the majority of flows.}

The proposed scheme is scalable, resilient to 0 -RTT replay attacks, and guarantees perfect forward secrecy. It requires no modifications to the QUIC standard and it is QUIC version independent. 0-RTT is crucial for web performance, particularly on mobile networks. Our experiments show that it reduces the time-to-first-byte by half and the server load by 40% compared to 1-RTT, regardless of the network latency. Using both synthetic and real-world traffic traces, we show that the proposed load balancer guarantees near-optimal load balancing performance. It also guarantees faster time-to-first-byte and faster completion time compared to other load balancing schemes, such as least loaded, power-of-two-choices, and maximum session affinity.}

	abstract = {The need to trust data has become a key requirement in modern distributed systems. To facilitate measurable trust and confidence in data and applications spanning heterogeneous systems, the emerging concept of a Data Confidence Fabric (DCF) offers a compelling solution. Data producers and processors provide metadata, known as annotations, recording trust insertion along the data delivery chain. Thus, it is possible to asses the trustworthiness of data before processing it. While a DCF, such as the Alvarium framework, enables this management of trust, there is a cost in terms of the overheads associated with security annotations themselves. To improve efficiency of a DCF, we therefore propose a set of techniques for making annotations more compact and to reduce the number of DCF transactions. Our work shows that transaction efficiency gains of up to 93% in our considered use cases can be achieved.}

	abstract = {LoRa has been widely adopted in Internet of Things (IoT) due to its long distance and low cost. With the largescale deployment of LoRa devices, it is not uncommon that multiple nodes transmit concurrently, leading to packet collisions and degraded performance. Previous studies have focused on examining single or multiple features in the received raw signals, named as chirp-level features, to separate collided packets for parallel decoding. However, the accuracy of feature extraction turns out to be vulnerable to interference, which can lead to incorrect packet decoding as network concurrency increases. Our study reveals that, other than the chirp-level features, a standard LoRa packet encoder introduces coding correlations across symbols of the same packet and thus leaves packet-level features to the symbols that can be utilized to disentangle symbols of collided packets in a new dimension. In this work, we introduce DeepDetangle, a Deep-learning-based feature fusion framework that efficiently fuses both packet-level and chirp-level features of symbols to enhance LoRa parallel decoding. DeepDetangle utilizes Complex-CNN and LSTM structures to capture multidimensional chirp-level features, their joint distributions, and temporal patterns. An MLP is employed to aggregate the chirplevel features with the packet-level features, thereby enabling the decoding of symbols on a per-block basis. By integrating features from both levels, erroneous symbols that cannot be recovered with chirp-level features alone can now be effectively corrected with other valid ones in the same block. Therefore, it demonstrates a strong capability to combat interference from other packets. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to assess the performance of DeepDetangle. The results indicate that DeepDetangle achieves \\mathbf{1 8. 1 \\%} to \\mathbf{8 0. 5 \\%} higher network throughput compared to existing works of similar complexity.}

	abstract = {Today's BGP-based Internet offers almost no control over forwarding paths to end users. Few opportunities exist to influence paths on an application-by-application basis, e.g., the traffic class field in the IP header, but that is usually dropped when a packet reaches the first ISP. In contrast, path-aware networking (PAN) as implemented in the SCION Internet architecture offers a wealth of path choices from which applications can pick desirable subsets. However, only a few dozen applications support SCION natively today. Instead, SCION deployments connect legacy applications through SCIONIP Gateways (SIGs) that provide an overlay IP network on top of SCION. In this work, we introduce an alternative SCION to legacyIP compatibility mechanism suitable for P4-programmable hardware that can replace the SIG, called SCION-IP translation. The SCION-IP Translator addresses two issues of the SIG. First, the SIG requires fragmentation and reassembly of the underlying IP packets - a process not easily done in P4. More importantly, SIGs form an overlay network on top of SCION. Native SCION applications cannot communicate with legacy applications. Thus, the SIG hinders native application development. The main innovation of the SCION-IP Translator is that it translates headers directly without introducing another (tunneling) layer to the network stack. We prototype a SCION-IP Translator using Intel Tofino switches of the first and second generation and provide insights from deploying SCION-IP translation in a university network participating in the SCION Education, Research and Academic network (SCIERA).}

	abstract = {We introduce QuARC, Quantum Adaptive Routing using Clusters, a novel clustering-based entanglement routing protocol that leverages redundant, multi-path routing through multi-particle projective quantum measurements to enable high-throughput, low-overhead, starvation-free entanglement distribution. At its core, QuARC periodically reconfigures the underlying quantum network into clusters of different sizes, where each cluster acts as a small network that distributes entanglement across itself, and the end-to-end entanglement is established by further distributing between clusters. QuARC does not require a-priori knowledge of any physical parameters, and is able to adapt the network configuration using static topology information, and using local (within-cluster) measurements only. We present a comprehensive simulation-based evaluation that shows QuARC is robust against changes to physical network parameters, and maintains high throughput without starvation even as network sizes scale and physical parameters degrade.}

	abstract = {Network speeds grow quickly in the modern cloud, so SmartNICs are introduced to offload network processing tasks, even application logic. However, typical multicore SmartNICs such as BlueFiled-2 are only capable of processing control-plane tasks with their embedded processors that have limited memory bandwidth and computing power. On the other hand, cloud applications evolve rapidly, such that a limited number of fixed hardware engines in a SmartNIC cannot satisfy the requirements of cloud applications. Therefore, SmartNIC programmers call for a programmable datapath accelerator (DPA) to process network traffic at line rate. However, no existing work has unveiled the performance characteristics of the existing DPA. To this end, we present the first architectural characterization of the latest DPA-enhanced BlueFiled-3 (BF3) SmartNIC. Our evaluation results indicate that BF3's DPA is significantly wimpier than the off-path Arm processor and the host CPU. However, we still identify that DPA has three unique architectural characteristics that unleash the performance potential of DPA. Specifically, we demonstrate how to take advantage of DPA's three architectural characteristics regarding computing, networking, and memory subsystems. Then we propose three important guidelines for programmers to fully unleash the potential of DPA. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct detailed case studies regarding each guideline. Our case study on key-value aggregation achieves up to 4.3 \\times higher throughput by using our guidelines to optimize memory combinations.}

	abstract = {To ensure the security and reliability of protocol implementations, protocol fuzzing serves as a crucial technique of security assessment and is widely adopted. However, existing fuzzers exhibit low efficiency after a certain duration of testing, primarily due to the lack of more flexible and adaptive guidance in seeds and states selection. In response to this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning guided fuzzer named RLGFuzz. Neural networks are employed to learn potential mappings between seeds and states to path coverage, which are then utilized in an interactive environment for reinforcement learning. This process allows the fuzzer to preferentially test seeds and states. Experimental results on a diverse set of real-world protocols demonstrate significant improvements in path coverage and triggering crashes efficiency achieved by our RLGFuzz. Compared to AFLNet, AFLNwe, and SMGFuzz, RLGFuzz outperforms all three, achieving a 6.68% enhancement in path coverage and a 5.52% enhancement in efficiency of triggering crashes.}

	abstract = {Intent-Based Networking (IBN) represents a novel paradigm of network automation and intelligence that has gradually been applied to network management. While the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has improved the current state of IBN, hardware heterogeneity and high network dynamics remain significant challenges. Hardware heterogeneity requires that IBN effectively manage a diverse range of devices. The high network dynamics demands that IBN align service needs with rapidly changing network resources. We propose LIT, a framework of LLM-empowered Intent Translation with manual guidance. Given the outstanding language understanding and generation capabilities of LLM, LIT utilizes it in intent translation task. To further address two prevalent problems encountered in IBN, we introduce manual guidance and Mixture of Experts (MoE). Under the guidance of the manual, LLM improves its ability to generate high-quality policies that comply with syntax. After introducing MoE, it makes fine-grained adjustments to the parameters of policies based on network status and service requirements. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that LIT considerably alleviates numerous current challenges confronted by IBN and excels in intent translation, attaining an F1 score that is \\mathbf{5 6. 7 \\%} higher than the baseline model.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification is a crucial research area aiming to enhance service quality, streamline network management, and bolster cybersecurity. To address the growing complexity of transmission encryption techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches face two main challenges. Firstly, they struggle with model inefficiency due to the quadratic complexity of the widely used Transformer architecture. Secondly, they suffer from inadequate traffic representation because of discarding important byte information while retaining unwanted biases. To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient linear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic representation scheme. We adopt a specially selected and improved unidirectional Mamba architecture for the networking field, instead of the Transformer, to address efficiency issues. In addition, we design a traffic representation scheme to extract valid information from massive traffic data while removing biased information. Evaluation experiments on six public datasets encompassing three main classification tasks showcase NetMamba's superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99 \\% (some over 99 \\%) in all tasks. Additionally, NetMamba demonstrates excellent efficiency, improving inference speed by up to 60 times while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, NetMamba is the first model to tailor the Mamba architecture for networking.}

	abstract = {Distributed sparse deep learning has been widely used in many Internet-scale applications. Network communication is one of the major hurdles for training performance. In-network gradient aggregation on programmable switches is a promising solution for speeding up the performance. Nevertheless, existing in-network aggregation solutions are designed for the dense deep training, and fall short when used for the sparse training. To address this gap, we present Zebra based on our key observation on the extremely biased update frequency of parameters in distributed sparse deep training. Specifically, Zebra offloads only the aggregation for “hot” parameters that are updated frequently onto programmable switches. To enable this offloading and achieve high aggregation throughput, we propose solutions to address the challenges related to hot parameter identification, parameter orchestration and gradient aggregation as well as system reliability. We implemented Zebra on Intel Tofino switches and integrated it with PS-lite. Finally, we evaluate Zebra's performance through extensive experiments and show that it can speed up the gradient aggregation by 1.5 \\sim 4 \\times and the end-to-end performance by 1.4 \\sim 2.6 \\times.}

	abstract = {In-network caching is one of the most important characteristic of Named Data Networking (NDN). However, while replacing producers in responding to interest requests, caching data packets also shields consumers from perceiving the bottleneck bandwidth of the transmission path between the producer and the consumer. Therefore, when the content source switches from the cache node to the producer due to data exhaustion, the consumer can not adjust the requesting rate accordingly, and may lead to the serious bufferbloat or packet loss - we call it as Cache Trap. We found that Cache Trap occurs commonly in streaming services and the state-of-art NDN congestion control schemes cannot achieve efficient and stable quality of service when it happens. To escape Cache Trap, this paper proposes an explicit rate feedback congestion control algorithm, named as RFCC. RFCC leverages NDN routers' ability of encapsulating customized information in data packets to send link state information to consumers. Specifically, when responding to interest packets, RFCC nodes estimate data throughput received from the producer and insert this information into the returned data packets. The consumer perceives the change of content source according to the hopcount tag in data packet, and then adjusts the sending rate of interest packet based on the explicit rate information. We have implemented RFCC in both real-world NDN live video streaming and NDNsim simulation platforms, and compared it with the state-of-arts congestion control algorithms in a variety of scenarios. The experimental results show that when Cache Trap occurs, RFCC maintains a stable QoE in live video streaming, reduces 50% delay jitters compared with DPCCP and achieves 2.4 \\times throughput compared with PCON.}

	abstract = {Modern networks require frequent configuration updates due to dynamic events, like network expansion and evolving traffic patterns. Existing network reconfiguration tools are effective in certain scenarios, but their practical deployment still has several limitations: (i) They are restricted to specific network topologies, protocols and specifications; (ii) They can cause transient violations; (iii) Their practical deployment is limited by huge computational overheads and the specialized hardware support. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Multi-Objective Optimizing Network Reconfiguration (MONR) framework, which comprises a translator and an optimizer, to automatically generate reconfiguration command sequences. The translator represents various input types into a unified graph format based on Datalog-like facts, which are regardless of the input format. Therefore, MONR supports diverse routing protocols and network specifications. The optimizer employs deep reinforcement learning techniques to simultaneously maximize the specification satisfaction of intermediate configurations and minimize both traffic shifts and the number of command updates to reduce computational overheads. It models the reconfiguration task as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and introduces a Dueling Prioritized Experience Replay Double Deep Q-Network (DPER-DDQN) algorithm to balance multiple objectives. We compare MONR with Snowcap, AED and ConfigReco. The evaluation demonstrates that MONR is 2x, 9x, and 56x faster than Snowcap, AED and ConfigReco. Furthermore, MONR maintains 100% specification consistency while reducing the traffic shifts (< 0.1) and the number of update commands (0.8 of Snowcap's).}

	abstract = {Congestion control algorithms, such as RENO and CUBIC, are vital for the Internet. However, numerous bugs have been discovered and reported in the Congestion Control Algorithm Implementations (CCAIs), even in those that have been extensively tested and used on the Internet for years, such as Linux RENO and Linux CUBIC. Some of these bugs have potentially severe impacts on the performance and stability of the Internet. Unfortunately, current CCAI testing and verification methods are inadequate for proving the absence of bugs, require substantial verification expertise, or are not scalable to a large number of acknowledgment packets (ACKs) that trigger CCAI actions. To address all these shortcomings, we propose an ACK Scalable Method, called ASM. Our experiments with two representative loss-based CCAIs, Linux RENO and CUBIC, demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed ASM even with tens of thousands of ACKs.}

	abstract = {Recent works have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can be deployed in P4-programmable user planes for line rate inference on live traffic and that these user planes can also be used to accelerate the 5G User Plane Function (UPF). This work builds on these capabilities to explore how ML inference in the user plane can facilitate real-time intrusion detection in 5G networks. As a proof-of-concept, we describe how an ML model could be deployed into the UPF as a special Packet Detection Rule (PDR). We then train and deploy a tree-based classifier into a P4programmable switch acting as the UPF and conduct experiments on a testbed with off-the-shelf hardware using experimental data from a 5 G test network on a university campus. Our results confirm that running ML-based intrusion detection on P4-based UPFs ensures line-rate attack detection and classification with an accuracy of up to 98 \\% in terms of F1 score, while keeping switch resource consumption increase under control.}

	abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Earth Observation (EO) satellites have changed the way we monitor Earth. Acting like moving cameras, EO satellites are formed in constellations with different missions and priorities, and capture vast data that needs to be transmitted to the ground for processing. However, EO satellites have very limited downlink communication capability, limited by transmission bandwidth, number and location of ground stations, and small transmission windows due to highvelocity satellite movement. To optimize resource utilization, EO constellations are expected to share communication spectrum and ground stations for maximum communication efficiency. In this paper, we investigate a new attack surface exposed by resource competition in \\mathbf{E O} constellations, targeting the delay or drop of Earth monitoring data using legitimate EO services. Specifically, an attacker can inject high-priority requests to temporarily preempt low-priority data transmission windows. Furthermore, we show that by utilizing predictable satellite dynamics, an attacker can intelligently target critical data from low-priority satellites, either delaying its delivery or irreversibly dropping the data. We formulate two attacks, the data delay attack and the data overflow attack, design algorithms to assist attackers in devising attack strategies, and analyze their feasibility or optimality in typical scenarios. We then conduct trace-driven simulations using real-world satellite images and orbit data to evaluate the success probability of launching these attacks under realistic satellite communication settings. We also discuss possible defenses against these attacks.}

	abstract = {Programmable switches are promising platforms for fast and flexible in-network computation; however, a standard mechanism, packet recirculation, degrades throughput due to bandwidth consumption caused by the loopback of not only packet headers but also cumbersome payloads. This paper proposes \\mathrm{P}^{4} \\text{QRS}, a mechanism for retaining payloads within the switch, reducing payload recirculations. Specifically, \\mathrm{P}^{4} QRS bifurcates packets into headers and payloads, which undergo the computation process through pipelines and the buffering process leveraging the switch's queue behavior, respectively; they then rendezvous for reassembly into complete packets to be sent out. To validate its effectiveness, we evaluated \\mathrm{P}^{4} QRS using an analytical model and implementation on state-of-the-art hardware programmable switches. Our evaluation shows that \\mathrm{P}^{4} QRS operates stably and intrinsically boosts complex in-switch computations.}

	abstract = {Data-intensive workloads like distributed deep learning generate significant temporary data between pipeline stages, requiring efficient temporary data storage solutions. Platforms like Kubernetes abstract infrastructure complexities by using loosely-coupled containers that leverage disaggregated storage for sharing data and storing state. This design facilitates workload deployment and scaling in the Cloud-Continuum, but also becomes a bottleneck, particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. A tiered storage system for temporary data can alleviate this issue by exploiting data locality: leveraging local storage attached to the physical hosts to share data between colocated containers without the need of accessing remote storage. This article serves as a preliminary work to explore how to efficiently and securely share data between co-located containers on the same physical host for workloads deployed on Kubernetes. Our experiments demonstrate that using CSI shared local volume mounts can be used not only to share files in an efficient and secure way but also to create shared memory regions and pass file descriptors, providing different viable approaches to data sharing for layered storage systems in Kubernetes.}

	abstract = {Many video streaming applications will simultaneously transfer data in both directions, from the user to the Internet (uplink) and from the Internet to users (downlink). However, for wireless local area networks (WLANs), the dominant scenarios, the uplink and downlink flows share the same half-duplex physical channel and compete for bandwidth resources. Their bandwidths would be fairly apportioned under the existing link layer access method, but a fair share might be suboptimal for applications. For better application performance, we propose Plum, to coordinate the bitrate of uplink and downlink flows, and allocate the bandwidth in both directions to cater to the application's demands. To make the deployment of Plum practical, we aim at not modifying the link layer but optimizing the transport layers and above. We evaluate our mechanisms with simulations based on real-world traces and testbed experiments, and results show that Plum could improve the video bitrate of streaming applications by up to 48-59%.}

	abstract = {As the prevalence of high-speed networks with augmented transmission capacities expands, the security technologies devised to shield these networks lag behind the rapid advancements. This disparity leads to many issues, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks representing the most harmful. In such attacks, hackers exploit numerous bots to flood the target with a torrent of vicious traffic or spurious requests, leading to the paralysis of the communication framework and the interruption of essential services. Existing defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks struggle to reconcile detection speed, lead time, and accuracy, revealing several deficiencies. Our method begins by employing a sketch-based algorithm characterized by minimal computational demands paired with considerable swiftness. This strategy significantly mitigates the intensity of DDoS attacks and reduces the imbalance rate of benign traffic and attacks. Subsequently, the deployment of the CatBoost classifier augments the detection's F1-score to 9 9. 6 4 \\%. The experimental findings corroborate the efficacy of DDoS-Dam in the expeditious detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks in high-speed networks.}

Both NDN and SCION emphasize end-to-end security and trust, while also offering multipath capabilities. This leads us to consider network layer based on named data that uses NDN for intradomain routing and forwarding, and SCION for inter-domain. Among the challenges to be overcome are where to implement the intra/inter-domain protocol transition, and how to scale the system to handle the vastly larger namespace of NDN. We describe a preliminary approach and lay out some key research questions.}

	abstract = {Low-latency applications drive an increasing number of modern applications. Latency depends on factors such as link layer technologies and how higher-layer protocols cope with transmission errors and packet losses. Most transport protocols rely exclusively on retransmissions to cope with losses with minimal overhead but potentially large tail latency. This paper leverages network coding to propose the high-speed robust tunnel (HIRT), providing timely packet delivery to any application independently of the transport protocol. A network code recovers lost data without requiring time-consuming retransmissions by adding redundancy packets, thereby slightly increasing the bandwidth usage to reduce the tail latency. Our algorithm dynamically adapts the rate of redundancy packets by measuring the network loss patterns. We implement HIRT using IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6). We suggest an efficient software implementation and demonstrate on CloudLab that our solution can protect traffic at high speeds (>50 \\text{Gbps}) on standard servers even when facing severe packet losses in the network. We evaluate HIRT with HTTP over TCP/QUIC, and file system benchmarks over a real network with losses, Starlink. HIRT reduces the tail latency of short HTTP requests by 2 \\times and the mean request completion time of longer requests by up to 20 \\%. HIRT also decreases the tail latency of NFS requests by up to 20 \\%.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel Multiparty Oblivious Multivariate Polynomial Evaluation (MOMPE) protocol, which enables secure multivariate polynomial computation among multiple parties for the first time. Unlike traditional Oblivious Polynomial Evaluation (OPE) protocols limited to two-party secure computation, MOMPE divides participating parties into a sender holding the multivariate polynomial P and n receivers, each holding a secret value \\alpha_{i} corresponding to a variable in P. Upon completion, the receivers learn P\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right), while the sender learns nothing. Assuming no collusion between the sender and receivers, we demonstrate MOMPE's security under the stringent Universal Composability (UC) framework, ensuring it remains secure in complex multiparty interactive environments. Our implementation and experiments validate MOMPE's performance, showing significantly less time consumption than the state-of-the-art Overdrive protocol for multiparty multivariate polynomial computation, while maintaining similar efficiency to OPE for participating parties. MOMPE has extensive application potential in privacy-preserving machine learning and collaborative data analysis, where multiple parties need to compute and analyze data together while protecting privacy. MOMPE offers a secure and efficient method for parties to utilize data without revealing sensitive information, opening new possibilities for privacy-preserving data collaboration and analysis.}

	abstract = {Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations provide Internet connectivity across the globe, but their network design poses significant challenges due to the large number of satellites and their fast movement. Named Data Networking (NDN) can bring many benefits to LEO satellite networks such as data-centric security, scalable content distribution, and intelligent data plane. A key enabler to these benefits is NDN's stateful forwarding, which unfortunately can be disrupted by the frequent handovers between the satellites and the ground terminals. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of these handovers on NDN's packet delivery and propose effective mitigation mechanisms. Using a newly developed packet-level simulator and in-depth analysis of packet forwarding behavior during handovers, we show that consumer handovers and producer handovers both lead to temporary packet losses but for different causes. To mitigate these problems, we design a new Interest retransmission strategy to handle consumer handovers, and a new forwarding strategy to handle producer handovers. Our evaluation shows that these solutions are effective in reducing packet losses and delivery time. This work sheds insights on how NDN can work in the presence of frequent satellite-ground handovers to enable data-centric communication in this new network environment.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has been recently used for malicious traffic detection. However, DL models are often faced with a dilemma between model size and performance: larger models have better accuracy, but suffer from high detection latency, which severely impacts realtime traffic performance, while lightweight models have low detection latencies, but sacrifice accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Proteus, a swift and precise attack detection framework that adaptively adjusts DL models in real-time based on sample detection difficulty. To address diverse detection difficulties in traffic data, we devise a Double Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DDCN) with two pivotal modules: the Dynamic Feature Campaign (DFC) and the Tailor Module (TM). DFC enables the model to discern and accentuate the most influential features, while TM autonomously gauges sample difficulty, cropping the overall model. We further design an auxiliary detection module to streamline the detection, especially for network devices like routers lacking GPUs but equipped with multiple CPU cores. Experiments on different network devices show that Proteus completes the detection of each flow within 0.6 ms, and achieves \\mathbf{9 9. 3 4 \\%} detection accuracy, outperforming other solutions.}

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is becoming pervasive and integrated into different kinds of intelligent applications, and the collaborative Cloud-Edge continuum has been introduced as an emerging trend to support their adoption into use cases. However, managing these ML applications in the CloudEdge continuum is challenging due to the ML application's dynamic resource usage with different user loads and Cloud and Edge's dynamic resource availability. We envision machine learning methods that can be used for smart management in this dynamic environment, but how to deploy and utilize them for the adaptation scenario in Cloud-Edge continuum is unknown. This paper proposes an agent-based framework to enable autonomous smart management mechanisms that can be broadly enabled in diverse adaptation scenarios. The agent acts as a data-connector1 1https://github.com/bsc-scanflow/data-connector, connecting different sources of data, utilizing ML models for decision-making and triggering adaptations in Cloud-edge platforms. The case study shows the feasibility of our proposed data-connector for smart migration of an ML workload in the Cloud-edge continuum. The result shows that the smart migration-enabled Cloud-edge scenario has 11.9% ML application prediction time better than the Cloud scenario without migration. Moreover, with minimal customization, the data connector agent can be adapted for more use cases.}

	abstract = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) has inherent location aware and spatial reuse advantages over RF-based technologies due to the Line-of-Sight (LoS) propagation of optical signals. Hence, OWC presents a fresh opportunity for effective and secure IoT connectivity and data transmission. However, most OWC systems design transmitter as a point source without considering its spatial diversity in data delivery in 3D space, which is not suitable for real-world mobile IoT connections among devices and users. In this paper, we design and implement HoloCube, which provides 3D optical IoT connections via software defined optical camera communication and Pepper's ghost effect. At the heart of the HoloCube design is multiple virtual 3D hollowed-out cubes with adaptive Spatial-Color Shift Keying (SCSK) modulation. Specifically, the virtual cube seen from various directions has constant structure but embeds different data over time. The cube's positioning elements provide double reference for both 3D reconstruction (spatial) and robust color decoding (spectral). Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HoloCube achieves practical 3D omnidirectional IoT connections with 70 Kbps goodput at 4 m in real-world indoor setting.}

	abstract = {Encrypted network traffic classification is fundamental for network management and security, including DDoS detection and mitigation. However, unknown category traffic can interfere with the classification of known traffic categories, leading to low recognition rates. To address this issue, we leverage the capability of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to efficiently handle high-dimensional traffic data. By mapping similar flows into the same hash buckets with LSH, the unknown category traffic can be filtered out, thereby reducing the interference from unknown category traffic and improving the classification accuracy of known category traffic. Based on this, we propose an LSH-TECNN strategy that combines the LSH with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer Encoder (TE). Firstly, a combination of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and LSH is used to determine whether the traffic belongs to known categories. Then, a Transformer Encoder and 2D-CNN are used to precisely classify the encrypted traffic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves classification accuracy by up to \\mathbf{1 2 \\%} and precision by up to 10 \\% compared to existing encrypted traffic classification methods.}

	abstract = {The physical topology of a datacenter network is fundamental as it determines latency, bisection bandwidth, the location and properties of congestion, and the network's ability to tolerate failures. Yet, topology is one of the most difficult factors to control during experimentation: when using a production datacenter or a testbed, the only topology available is the one already deployed. If running on an experimenter's own equipment, rewiring may be possible but is cumbersome and of limited scale. This presents a challenge for controlled experimentation, because such experiments should ideally be run on a range of realistic topologies. To tackle this, we present our work on Topocloud, a system that enables experimenters to construct and modify network topologies in a shared public testbed. Topocloud uses hardware P4 switches to fulfill a dual role: each port can act as either a typical Ethernet MAC-learning switch or as a “virtual wire” that connects ports transparently. We demonstrate that virtual wires in Topocloud can be used to construct low latency network topologies incorporating L2 switches.}

	abstract = {More and more AI-enabled applications are deployed on numerous devices, which rely on cloud platforms to provide complicated AI models and execution. The untrusted cloud environment raises serious security concerns about user data privacy and remote computation integrity. However, existing approaches rely on expensive cryptographic or hardware methods which are rarely adopted by the cloud. This paper proposes a fine-grained outsourcing strategy that only outsources composite reversible computation inside inference tasks to the cloud. Composite reversible computation allows us to convert the results calculated using obfuscated data back to actual results. The cloud is not required to be trusted, and we employ obfuscation and verification at the device to guarantee secure and accurate inference execution. Thanks to the reversibility of the computation, processing on the obfuscated data does not lose model accuracy and the reversed results allow the device to verify the computation quality. We conduct a feasibility analysis and the preliminary result shows the on-device obfuscation and verification still have performance benefits in the case of fine-grained outsourced computation.}

	abstract = {Short video applications such as TikTok, Douyin, and Kwai have experienced significant popularity in recent years. However, the quality of experience (QoE) provided by short video streaming services still falls short of expectations. As a leading provider of short video services with proprietary video players and content delivery network (CDN) capabilities, we are in a unique position to optimize the QoE of these services. In this study, we present our pilot investigation into congestion control performance optimization for short video services by leveraging collaboration between user-end video players and edge servers. Based on a comprehensive measurement study of network characteristics from production networks and incorporating feedback from video players, we developed an optimized congestion control algorithm called BBR-E2E. We deployed BBR-E2E in our production network and conducted a large-scale A/B testing across the country, involving trillions of video sessions over a three-month period in China. Overall, we observed a 1.6% reduction in rebuffering duration and a 6.2% decrease in rebuffering count. At the provincial level11A province in China is similar to a state in the USA., the improvements were even more substantial, with up to a 7.8% reduction in rebuffering duration and a 13.7% decrease in rebuffering count.}

	abstract = {Recently emerged as a disruptive networking paradigm, quantum networks rely on the mysterious quantum entanglement to teleport qubits without physically transferring quantum particles. However, the state of quantum systems is extremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat against quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its benefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an entanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2) how to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity constraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For the first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling algorithm for the singlehop case and analyze the PURIFY-AND-SWAP strategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for its optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomialtime algorithm constructing an \\epsilon\n-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness of our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {5G-and-beyond cellular networks are set to enable ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC), catering to a wide range of applications such as real-time control and extended reality (XR). For these URLLC applications, it is crucial to ensure per-packet communication reliability and high throughput. To this end, we propose a novel joint scheduling and power control approach, denoted by PktR, that ensures application-specific per-packet communication reliability as well as high channel spatial reuse and high network throughput. PktR is designed as a close-loop system, incorporating Gain-Ratio-K (GRK) interference modeling, optimization, and transmit power control mechanisms. PktR ensures predictable interference control for receivers and fine-tunes transmit power at transmitters in a highly agile manner. Our measurement studies demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of ensuring per-packet communication reliability in live cellular systems, by showing that PktR ensures high per-packet communication SINR (e.g., 20dB) and high success probability (e.g., 0.9) across diverse network and environmental settings. Through local, distributed coordination, PktR also outperforms state-of-the-art solutions significantly. For instance, besides ensuring predictable guarantee of required per-packet communication reliability in scenarios where existing solutions are unable to provide such guarantees for up to 31.01 % of the network links, PktR improves the network throughput by a factor up to 1.596.}

	abstract = {Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have evolved into mega-constellations with hundreds to thousands of satellites inter-connecting with inter-satellite links (ISLs). Network planning, which plans for network resources and architecture to improve the network performance and save operational costs, is crucial for satellite network management. However, due to the large scale of mega-constellations, high dynamics of satellites, and complex distribution of real-world traffic, it is extremely challenging to conduct scalable network planning on mega-constellations with high performance. In this paper, we propose SATFLOW, a distributed and hierarchical network planning framework to plan for the network topology, traffic allocation, and fine-grained ISL terminal power allocation for mega-constellations. To tackle the hardness of the original problem, we decompose the grand problem into two hierarchical sub-problems, tackled by two-tier modules. A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed for the upper-level module so that the overall laser energy consumption and ISL operational costs can be minimized; A distributed alternating step algorithm is proposed for the lower-level module so that the laser energy consumption could be minimized with low time complexity for a given topology. Extensive simulations on various mega-constellations validate SATFLOW's scalability on the constellation size, reducing the flow violation ratio by up to 21.0 \\% and reducing the total costs by up to 89.4 \\%, compared with various state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

	abstract = {RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv2) employs Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) for a lossless fabric to maintain high performance. However, PFC can cause Deadlocks, which pauses traffic and potentially leads to severe exceptions for applications. Existing solutions solve deadlocks at a considerable cost, resulting in degradation of end-to-end network performance.We present Roundabout, a data plane scheme designed to detect and resolve deadlocks with minimal side effects. We first analyze how switches in different states contribute to deadlocks. Based on the analysis, we design an election-based distributed detection scheme that efficiently and robustly identifies deadlocks. By exploiting buffer configuration redundancy, we develop an innetwork collaborative packet scheduling scheme that forwards deadlocked packets to their destinations in a lossless manner, facilitating natural deadlock resolution. Additionally, we implement a barrier mechanism to ensure in-order packet delivery to the receiver. Both analysis and experiments demonstrate that Roundabout effectively detects and resolves deadlocks while minimizing side effects to the network, making it an ideal enhancement for PFC switches.}

	abstract = {Efficient global Internet scanning is crucial for network measurement and security analysis. While existing target generation algorithms verify remarkable performance in largescale detection, their efficiency notably diminishes in few-seed scenarios. This decline is primarily attributed to the intricate configuration rules and sampling bias of seed addresses. Moreover, instances where BGP prefixes have few seed addresses are widespread, constituting 63.65 \\% of occurrences. We introduce 6 Vision to tackle this challenge by introducing a novel approach to encoding IPv6 addresses into images, facilitating comprehensive analysis of intricate configuration rules. Through feature stitching, 6 Vision not only improves the learnable features but also amalgamates addresses associated with configuration patterns for enhanced learning. Moreover, it integrates an environmental feedback mechanism to refine model parameters based on identified active addresses, thereby alleviating the sampling bias inherent in seed addresses. As a result, 6Vision achieves high-accuracy detection even in few-seed scenarios. The HitRate of 6 Vision is improved by 181 \\% \\sim 2,490 \\% compared to existing algorithms, while the CoverNum is 1.18 \\sim 11.20 times that of them. Additionally, 6Vision can function as a preliminary detection module for existing algorithms, yielding a conversion gain (CG) ranging from 242 \\% \\sim 2,081 \\%. Ultimately, we achieve a conversion rate (CR) of 28.97 \\% for few-seed scenarios. We enrich the IPv6 hitlist, not only enhancing current target generation algorithms for large-scale address detection in few-seed scenarios but also effectively supporting IPv6 network measurement and security analysis.}

	abstract = {Serverless computing offers a novel alternative for developing and deploying applications. By abstracting backend architecture from the user, developers are encouraged to write code without worrying about server management, scaling, or maintenance. The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model optimizes this by allowing developers to deploy discrete functions that scale automatically in response to demand without deep concerns about the scalability of the execution infrastructure or platform. Lithops, a multi-cloud serverless computing framework, follows this trend and enables developers to execute Python code across thousands of cloud cores without modifying local scripts. Despite its potential to deploy parallel jobs, Lithops has been designed for running big data jobs over cloud environments, and its applicability to High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems has been unexplored. This paper introduces a novel architecture enabling Lithops deployment in HPC systems like the MareNostrum 5 supercomputer. By leveraging the immense computational power of the HPC-MN5 supercomputer and the FaaS model of Lithops, the architecture aims to offer high performance and scalability while simplifying application coding and deployment. Our evaluations display Lithops' benchmarks over the MareNostrum 5 HPC scale with the number of nodes, outperforming other commercial cloud platforms in terms of Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) and read-write bandwidth, and avoiding CPU wastage.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic primitives are of paramount importance to guarantee security properties in communication networks. The associated computational complexity of cryptography standards makes it prohibitive to execute these primitives at line rate in the network core. Existing implementations of cryptographic MAC algorithms in \\mathbf{P 4}\nfor programmable switches impose a severe performance penalty due to packet recirculation, which may not be tolerable at those network speeds. In this paper, we propose the first data plane design in \\mathbf{P 4}\nof the Chaskey algorithm, a widely used secure and lightweight cryptographic MAC algorithm, tailored for the PISA switch architecture. Our P4Chaskey is the first solution to compute MACs using 128-bit keys without packet recirculation, guaranteeing line rate Terabit speeds. As state-of-the-art solutions require recirculations for the same key size (reducing throughput performance) or offer weaker security (smaller keys), P4CHASKEY is now, to our knowledge, the most efficient MAC design for the target switch architecture.}

	abstract = {Decentralized federated learning (DFL) uses peer-topeer communication to avoid the single point of failure problem in federated learning and has been considered an attractive solution for machine learning tasks on distributed devices. We provide the first solution to a fundamental network problem of DFL: what overlay network should DFL use to achieve fast training of highly accurate models, low communication, and decentralized construction and maintenance? Overlay topologies of DFL have been investigated, but no existing DFL topology includes decentralized protocols for network construction and topology maintenance. Without these protocols, DFL cannot run in practice. This work presents an overlay network, called FedLay, which provides fast training and low communication cost for practical DFL. FedLay is the first solution for constructing near-random regular topologies in a decentralized manner and maintaining the topologies under node joins and failures. Experiments based on prototype implementation and simulations show that FedLay achieves the fastest model convergence and highest accuracy on real datasets compared to existing DFL solutions while incurring small communication costs and being resilient to node joins and failures.}

	abstract = {Key-value stores are essential to online services such as e-commerce. In key-value stores, a hotspot (i.e., frequently accessed items) may cause severe load imbalances, high response latency, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. However, existing works only focus on specific types of hotspots, thus overlooking other types of hotspots and leading to blind spots. In this paper, we propose SpotMon, a system that enables general hotspot monitoring in key-value stores. Specifically, we (1) systematically identify the generality requirements of hotspot monitoring from existing works, (2) formulate general hotspot monitoring as an arbitrary partial spot query problem, (3) measure the hotness of hotspot candidates with a new vector expression, (4) propose hotspot encoding, filtering, decoding, and querying to support general queries without focusing on specific hotspots, (5) leverage the in-network visibility of programmable switches to identify system-wide hotspots. Our extensive experiments indicate that SpotMon provides high accuracy (e.g., F1 score from 0.88 to 1) and enables efficient hotspot mitigations (e.g., up to 4.03 \\times MQPS).}

	abstract = {Underwater Optical Wireless Communication (UOWC) is considered a promising approach, offering the potential for flexible and high-speed communication under the surface of the water. However, the interdependent relationship among three key performance elements, namely communication distance, bit error rate, and communication rate, has been largely overlooked. This oversight impedes the complete utilization of the system performance. In this work, we innovatively introduce a “UOWC Impossible Trinity” model and theorems to establish relationships among the three key performance elements, which clarify the inherent constraints within UOWC system optimization. Moreover, we formulate the Underwater Optical Communication Trade-offs (UOCT) Problem to maximize communication performance. Furthermore, we provide feasible non-dominated solution sets, considering the constraints of real environments and user demands of specific scenarios. Our model has been validated by extensive simulations, demonstrating that our approach not only clarifies fundamental limitations of UOWC systems, but also provides practical guidelines for designing and optimizing the systems. Our approach has been experimentally validated with an impressive accuracy of over 95%, surpassing conventional models, which not only enhances the understanding of UOWC system optimization but also validates the existence of inherent trade-offs. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates a significant increase in communication distance, outperforming traditional methods by more than 20%.}

Despite their widespread utility, DHTs face substantial challenges in handling range queries, which are crucial for applications such as storage systems, decentralized databases, content distribution networks, and blockchains. To address this limitation, we present LEAD, a novel system incorporating learned models within DHT structures to significantly optimize range query performance. LEAD utilizes a recursive machine learning model to map and retrieve data across a distributed system while preserving the inherent order of data. Preliminary results indicate LEAD achieves tremendous advantages in system efficiency compared to existing range query methods in large-scale distributed systems while maintaining high scalability and resilience to network churn.}

	abstract = {RDMA is a kernel-bypass and transport-offload technology that provides high throughput and low delay for datacenter networks, and DCQCN is the default and most widely used congestion control algorithm in large-scale RDMA networks. DCQCN involves over 10 parameters at RNICs and switches, and their settings significantly affect network performance, currently relying heavily on exhaustive manual tuning. Although some automatic methods are proposed to tune a subset of DCQCN parameters, none of them comprehensively address all parameters at both RNICs and switches, resulting in compromised network performance. In this paper, we propose Paraleon, an automatic and adaptive system to tune DCQCN parameters comprehensively. We design a millisecond-level sketch-based monitoring mechanism for accurate network-wide measurement, which collects runtime metrics as feedback to guide the tuning process. We also analyze the complicated parameter impacts on network performance, and leverage an improved heuristic searching algorithm for timely performance optimization with better efficiency and convergence. We implement Paraleon and conduct extensive experiments in both NS3 simulations and a real-world testbed. The results show that Paraleon achieves 3.8 \\% \\sim 61.4 \\% higher performance than existing tuning schemes.}

In this paper, however, we explore the unconventional idea of deliberately congesting the queues of a network device to enhance the performance of a Network Function (NF) deployment. The key intuition behind this approach is to utilize the existing memory available in the switch queues to store packet payloads while their headers are processed on an external NF processor. We present two techniques for congesting a port on a switch: i) self-clocking packet recirculation, which recirculates packets within the switch to automatically achieve the correct queuing delay, and ii) a proportional controller using multicast forwarding, which adjusts the rate of packet forwarding based on the level of congestion. We evaluate our approaches both in simulations and a prototype.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has been applied across diverse domains as a powerful technique but faces critical challenges in privacy protection. Secure aggregation and additive homomorphic encryption are two of the most commonly used cryptographic methods to protect model updates. To provide a strong privacy guarantee, both methods satisfy the additivity and require the integer form to encrypt model updates. However, they still suffer from a non-negligible overhead of the computation and communication. To mitigate such overhead, existing approaches of lossy compression (e.g., gradient compression) have been explored but exhibit the inapplicability of FL with additive cryptographic methods. In this paper, we propose FedSSA, a novel compression framework to reduce the overhead of additive cryptographic methods in FL based on two new techniques: (i) QSRHT Sketch, a sketch-based compression method that supports large compression ratios with a bounded error with the integer requirement, and (ii) periodic rehashing, which ensures the unbiasedness of QSRHT Sketch. Our evaluation shows that FEDSSA achieves a high compression ratio (\\times 160) with a low model accuracy degradation (less than 5%). For additive homomorphic encryption, FEDSSA reduces the average computation time per round by up to 58.15 % compared to state-of-the-art compressor that support additive homomorphic encryption, with a low test accuracy drop (within 2.2 %).}

	abstract = {Deploying machine learning models within the data plane can facilitate traffic analysis at line rate. Nevertheless, existing schemes suffer from performance degradation when faced with hardware resource constraints. They further cannot accommodate incremental model updates as the underlying traffic distributions change. This paper presents Linc, a novel framework for low-resource and incrementally updatable innetwork classification. To circumvent the complicated P4 program that consumes extensive resources, Linc generalizes explicit deployable classification rules by interpreting a customized neural network. For incremental updates with minimal new training data, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the update task into binary classification tasks within distinct subspaces to simplify the task. We then update the model locally within each subspace to improve accuracy for new categories without compromising the accuracy of existing categories. Experimental results reveal that, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Linc significantly reduces switch hardware resources by up to 15.6 \\times and achieves up to 11.63 \\% higher classification accuracy. During the incremental model updates, Linc not only improves the accuracy by 26.1 \\% but also decreases the table entries by 6 \\times.}

	abstract = {Interactive video applications signal widespread interest in Real-time communication (RTC), yet issues like frame delay, rebuffering, etc. remain a common complaint. We argue that this is mainly due to legacy network-oriented congestion control (CC), which assumes a continuous stream of packets is being sent. But this assumption doesn't hold in RTC since the video encoder exhibits inherent bit-rate variation: (1) Bursty spiking bit-rate leads to packets waiting in the sending buffer, which increases frame delay. (2) Low bit-rate causes insufficient packets available for sending, making current CCs hard to detect available bandwidth. In response, we propose BurstRTC, a novel paradigm for RTC transport protocol. Each frame is emitted as a whole, and the video bit-rate is directly controlled by network congestion feedback. BurstRTC uses frame-bursting to estimate available bandwidth efficiently regardless of bit-rate variation. Considering the impact of bit-rate variation on network congestion, BurstRTC models frame size as a Gaussian distribution instead of a fixed size and further derives its frame delay, preventing suboptimal performance of purely network-oriented designs. An analytic method for determining the target bit-rate replaces the trial-and-error updates of gradient-based methods, ensuring fast convergence to the available bandwidth. We evaluated the performance of BurstRTC and found that, compared with GCC, BurstRTC achieves up to 59.8 \\% higher bit-rate and up to \\mathbf{4 8. 9 \\%} lower frame delay. Further, compared with SQP and Pudica, BurstRTC can also reduce tail frame delay by up to 89.2 \\%, and improve average bit-rate by up to 15.6 \\%.}

	abstract = {LoRa, as a typical representative of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), has been widely used to connect massive IoT devices. However, in mobile applications, there is massive packet loss in LoRa transmission due to link performance degradation, especially when LoRa end-devices move far from the gateway or into obstructed areas. Existing studies take little account of end-device movement, particularly when the movement pattern is unknown. We propose LMLoRa to enhance the Link Performance for Mobile LoRa networks in general scenarios. The key observation is that repeating the original packet content enhances link performance and allows smaller and more energy-efficient transmission parameter selections. Technically, LMLoRa proposes a link performance estimation model for mobile LoRa networks based on packet content repetition. Second, we exploit key hardware features of LoRa to obtain much continuous RSSI information for link quality prediction. Additionally, LMLoRa develops a channel frequency allocation policy to mitigate transmission collisions. Finally, LMLoRa designs a communication mechanism to assist the estimation model and work the whole system with low communication overhead. We design and implement LMLoRa in complex realworld environments, results show that LMLoRa enhances packet reception rate by 33.4% and energy efficiency by 14.4% on average compared with the state-of-the-art.}
