	abstract = {Cloud computing has seen widespread adoption because it increases the productivity and efficiency of industries and allows for effective scalability of their business [1]. Guaranteeing performance levels is at the core of cloud services and requires huge computational resources, especially with the latest advances in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things [2]. Typically, customers subscribe to agreements where cloud providers ensure specific levels of reliability, availability and responsiveness to systems and applications and describe penalties if the service levels are not met. At the same time, massive computational resources are a cost for providers and have a significant environmental impact, which will increase in the future. It is estimated that the energy consumption of data centres (which host cloud services) will grow from 292 TWh in 2016 to 353 TWh in 2030 [3], and greenhouse gas emissions will increase over 14% in 2040, compared to a 1-1.6% increase in the 2007–2016 [4].}

	abstract = {Spread estimation is an essential issue in high-speed networks with wide applications, such as network billing, quality of service, anomaly detection, etc. As a promising technique, sketch can efficiently estimate per-flow spread with only a small memory cost. Many studies focus on improving the performance of sketches. However, these works primarily focus on optimizing the counter level or sketch level without considering the scenario of multi-spread estimation, which is crucial for improving memory utilization and detecting anomalies. In this paper, we propose an efficient flow information compression algorithm based on the on-chip/off-chip hybrid framework to estimate multiple flow spreads. In the on-chip memory, we filter out non-duplicates and sample them to the off-chip space for recording. In the off-chip memory, we compress each sampled non-duplicate to a carefully designed bit-cube. When the measurement is finished, we separate corresponding KV-flows from a specific flow based on the user query. Then, we rebuild this flow to a subset group based on the duplicate number of each KV-flow. Finally, according to the Multi-set theory, we derive an accurate multi-spread estimate formula to solve this issue with a high throughput and small on-chip memory usage. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our proposed estimator using real Internet traffic traces downloaded from CAIDA. Experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposal achieves a 97.2% lower average relative error in per-destination source flow spread estimation with a tight on-chip memory, e.g., 320KB. And our proposed method achieves 31.86 higher processing throughput.}

	abstract = {Multipath transport can be used in heterogeneous wireless environments to provide seamless connectivity between a mobile device and edge nodes. Two challenges of different nature can be addressed by multipath transport: 1) seamless handovers; and 2) bandwidth aggregation across multiple access networks to obtain a more reliable end-to-end service. Multipath transport has been widely explored for wired networks and for web access. However, existing solutions target reliable throughput, while emerging use cases often favour delivery timeliness, eventually at the cost of some errors. This work discusses multi-access Real-time Transport Protocol (MA-RTP), a multipath protocol for sensor stream transport. The motivation behind developing MA-RTP stems from the need for a multipath transport protocol specifically designed to cater to the requirements of real-time, loss-tolerant data streams. It is associated to a context-based scheduler to decide which access network to use. Both the protocol and the scheduler are implemented and tested in a video offloading scenario with 5G and 802.11ac access technologies to show the potential of the proposal.}

	abstract = {Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain technology has had a significant impact on many fields. The lack of effective communication between heterogeneous and isolated blockchains, however, restricts the promotion and ecological development of blockchain industry. In this context, crosschain technology has rapidly developed and become a new research hotspot. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain and the complexity of crosschain scenarios, crosschain technology faces huge security risks. In this paper, we propose formal analysis of the IBC protocol, one of the most popular crosschain communication protocols, aiming to help developers design and implement crosschain technologies more securely. We formalize three main components of the IBC protocol with TLA+, a temporal logic specification language, and verify some important requirements with model checking tool TLC. The verification results are analyzed comprehensively. Issues found through our formal analysis have been reported to the community, most of which have been acknowledged. We also propose some recommendations for removing potential risks.}

	abstract = {Recent works introduce In-Network Aggregation (INA) for distributed training (DT), which moves the gradient summation into network programmable switches. INA can reduce the traffic volume and accelerate communication in DT jobs. However, switch memory is a scarce resource, unable to support massive DT jobs in data centers, and existing INA solutions have not utilized switch memory to the best extent. We propose DSA, an Efficient Data-Plane switch memory Scheduler for in-network Aggregation. DSA introduces preemption to the switch memory management for INA jobs. In the data plane, DSA allows gradient tensors with high priority to preempt the switch aggregators (basic computation unit in INA) from tensors with low priority, which avoids an aggregator wasting time in idle. In the control plane, DSA devises a priority policy which assigns high priority to gradient tensors that benefit overall job efficiency more, e.g., communication-intensive jobs. We prototype DSA and experiments show that DSA can improve the average JCT by up to 1.35x compared with baseline solutions.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication has attracted significant interest recently due to its capability to meet the fast growing demand on user-defined and human-oriented communication services such as holographic communications, eXtended reality (XR), and human-to-machine interactions. Unfortunately, recent study suggests that the traditional Shannon information theory, focusing mainly on delivering semantic-agnostic symbols, will not be sufficient to investigate the semantic-level perceptual quality of the recovered messages at the receiver. In this paper, we study the achievable data rate of semantic communication under the symbol distortion and semantic perception constraints. Motivated by the fact that the semantic information generally involves rich intrinsic knowledge that cannot always be directly observed by the encoder, we consider a semantic information source that can only be indirectly sensed by the encoder. Both encoder and decoder can access to various types of side information that may be closely related to the user's communication preference. We derive the achievable region that characterizes the tradeoff among the data rate, symbol distortion, and semantic perception, which is then theoretically proved to be achievable by a stochastic coding scheme. We derive a closed-form achievable rate for binary semantic information source under any given distortion and perception constraints. We observe that there exists cases that the receiver can directly infer the semantic information source satisfying certain distortion and perception constraints without requiring any data communication from the transmitter. Experimental results based on the image semantic source signal have been presented to verify our theoretical observations.}

Concurrent pulse flows can lead to significant congestion in access points, making network providers unable to guarantee the quality of experience (QoE) for all users. To maximize the number of satisfied users, we propose a cross-layer assisted traffic scheduling mechanism, CTS, to manage flows into the edge network. We evaluated CTS using a trace-driven simulator, and the experimental results prove that CTS achieves the theoretical maximum of satisfied users and maintains a more balanced load for the network.}

	abstract = {Consistent hashing (CH) is a crucial building block for load-balancers. It enables packets of the same flow to keep being mapped to the same server whenever possible. Load- balancers implement heterogeneous CH to deal with the varying server speeds. However, they mostly rely on the old Ring algorithm, suffering from practical scalability and stability issues, as well as from a lack of theoretical stability guarantees. This paper presents a new framework for heterogeneous CH. The framework relies on quantization using virtual servers, and on a min-max fairness-based mapping algorithm denoted M3. The paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee stability for any arbitrary heterogeneous server service rate. We also explain why M3 presents better scalability properties than all heterogeneous CH alternatives, including a faster key lookup rate and a lower memory footprint. Finally, evaluations show that M3 also offers a significantly increased stability region.}

Our framework is built on top of the dynamic role-based names and can be implemented using attribute-based encryption (ABE) or public key encryption (PKE).

	abstract = {To achieve fast and accurate attack detection, some works manually tailor neural networks (NNs) for deployment on CPUs of gateways, routers, or even programmable switches. However, with such solutions, NNs must be custom-tailored across different devices to meet the heterogeneous settings (e.g., OS and CPU types). Even worse, a model may require frequent adjustments to adapt to the same device's varying traffic rates. In this paper, we present Soteria, an automated multi-latency NN generation and scheduling system for fast and accurate detection against fluctuating traffic rates across heterogeneous hardware. Soteria first uses an evolutionary training algorithm to evolve the Pareto front, i.e., the set of NNs with a good spread on accuracy and model size. Then, for each device, Soteria filters the optimal multi-latency NNs by non-dominating sorting on the NNs' test latency on the device. Finally, to cope with the dynamic traffic rate, we design a heuristic scheduling scheme that adaptively selects NN s to maintain a balance between the detection accuracy and latency.}

	abstract = {The rapid integration of Internet of Things (loT) systems in public infrastructure like smart campuses has ex-panded the attack surface through edge devices, amplifying the risk of insider attacks. Traditional defense tools use centralized systems, typically located off-campus, for log monitoring to facilitate intrusion detection and security protocol enforcement in smart infrastructures. The limited real-time data access and observability provided to on-site staff in smart buildings under this traditional approach presents an advantage to intruders with physical access to exploit vulnerabilities in the loT sensing and perception layers. In this study, we explore the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to facilitate real-time monitoring of various sensors and loT devices to provide an application for actionable insights for security and maintenance in a smart campus environment. The proposed application aims to enable key non -expert personnel, such as security guards and maintenance staff, to actively participate in cybersecurity defense by providing immediate data access and connectivity between dispersed endpoints throughout the campus. The paper further investigates the potential benefits and challenges of using AR interfaces to visualize complex sensor networks. In addition, we discuss the implications of our findings on the future design and management of smart campuses, emphasising improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations and maintenance activities.}

	abstract = {Due to the ability to maintain good accuracy and high throughput with limited memory resources, sketch has gained wide deployment and application for approximate flow estimation. However, most existing sketch approaches ignore the distinctions between flow priorities, though the high-priority flows are relatively scarce but hold significant information. Therefore, a class of priority-aware sketches has appeared recently to provide differentiated measurement accuracy for flows with different priorities. Unfortunately, it is challenging for these priority-aware sketches to strike a good balance between accuracy and throughput. To address this issue, we propose a priority-adaptive architecture PA-Sketch, which utilizes priority-aware hash to dynamically allocate appropriate numbers of hash functions for different flows according to their priorities. For the scenarios we experimented, we observed that PA-Sketch significantly improves accuracy while minimizing the hash overhead. Compared to the state-of-the-art priority-aware sketches, PA-Sketch achieves around 4.83x higher accuracy and 1.83x higher F1 score for high-priority flows on average, meanwhile maintaining slight accuracy loss for low-priority flows.}

To address this issue, per-hop flow control (FC) has gained popularity due to its ability to react promptly to transient congestion. However, existing FC mechanisms either lack fine-grained (i.e., per-flow granularity) control or require an impractical number of queues that exceeds the capabilities of commodity switches. In this paper, we introduce Flowsail, an innovative FC scheme that enables fine-grained control at the per-flow level while requiring a practical number of switch queues, theoretically as few as two. The core of Flowsail is an effective approximation of ideal FC by three key design components: dynamic flow-to-queue mapping, hierarchical congested flow identification, and on-demand isolation. We have implemented a prototype of FLOWSAIL using the programmable P4 switch and conducted extensive testbed experiments and simulations. The results indicate that Flowsail effectively sustains performance with significantly fewer queues compared to existing FC schemes. For instance, FLOWSAIL achieves 4.3 x lower tail latency under the same number of queues, matches existing FC schemes with 4 x fewer queues, and holds robust performance with a minimum of 2 queues.}

	abstract = {LoRa Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has emerged as a dominant technology for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). However, due to the ever-growing network size, packet collisions caused by concurrent transmissions have become a serious challenge in LoRa Wan.Existing studies have either ignored the issue by exploring only a few inaccurate features or addressed it using a complex receiver with up to eight antennas. To strike a better balance between implementation cost and system performance, we propose Hi 2 LoRa, which leverages highly dimensional and highly accurate features for LoRa concurrent decoding with only two receiving antennas. The feature dimensions are extended by exploring various types of hardware imperfections and channel state information inherent to each transceiver pair. To improve feature accuracy, low pass filters and BiLSTM networks are employed to trace and learn their temporal patterns. Additionally, an effective collision suppression strategy is introduced to combat feature corruption from other concurrent packets. Extensive evaluations on real-world testbeds show that the achievable concurrency in Hi2LoRa is either close to that of state-of-the-art approaches with much higher complexity (e.g., using eight antennas) or 2.7 x of prior work with comparable complexity (e.g., using two antennas).}

	abstract = {Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is a specialized high-speed memory that enables fast parallel lookups for both exact-match rules and wildcard-match rules. TCAM has become a standard hardware component in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) switches to implement flow tables for packet classification. However, limited TCAM storage capacity poses a significant scalability challenge for SDN to enforce fine-grained policy-based forwarding. To this end, TCAM-based rule-caching systems are proposed by combining TCAM with Random Access Memory (RAM). Specifically, TCAM caches heavy-hitting rules to capture packets from hot flows, while RAM accommodates the complete ruleset for other cache-miss packets. However, previous rule-caching systems either failed to eliminate cross-rule dependencies or restricted their applications to prefix rules only. In this work, we propose AWEsome-Cache, a unifying framework to fundamentally eliminate cross-rule dependencies for wildcard rules with arbitrary matching patterns. The rationale behind AWEsome-Cache is to concretize a minimum number of wildcard bits in the best-match rule, thereby pruning its overlapping match fields with all direct dependent rules. AWEsome-Cache also develops replacement algorithms during TCAM updates to adapt to dynamic traffic locality. Experiments with prefix and non-prefix rules show that AWEsome-Cache outperforms baselines in achieving a comparable cache-hit rate but requiring 75.9% less TCAM occupancy.}

Efficient, secure dissemination of information can play a critical role in disaster management. But, secure and authenticated group communications that maintain confidentiality and integrity remain a challenge. In this paper, we design a flexible and efficient encryption framework SAFE that leverages graph-based naming frameworks for providing role-based communication among first responders. We study the suitability of message-oriented encryption where the sender leverages the name hierarchy, and compare it with a key-oriented encryption scheme that requires the receiver to utilize appropriate keys to decrypt based on the publisher-targeted name for the message. Both encryption schemas can be built with attribute-based encryption (ABE) or public key encryption (PKE) implementations. We find message-oriented encryption provides the needed flexibility for dynamic environments when communicating with members changes frequently. With message-oriented encryption, we further address key revocation and support for infrastructure-less environments in disaster situations and consider the tradeoff between flexibility and optimization for large relatively static communication groups. We evaluate both encryption schemas built on top of ABE and PKE. We examine the key generation time, ciphertext length, encryption, and decryption time, and see that SAFE's design is the most suitable for large and dynamically changing groups.}

Data markets require strong privacy guarantees for digital asset procurement. The inherent properties of a blockchain can provide significant benefits in the data-market use case. In fact, there are many commercial platforms currently leveraging blockchain technologies for blockchain-based data markets. Leveraging blockchain for data market use cases creates the opportunity for new logical architectures to preserve privacy in the blockchain ecosystem. This publication proposes a multi-faceted solution for stronger privacy guarantees for digital asset procurement on blockchain-based data markets. An architecture will be detailed which provides better guarantees of privacy to those acquiring digital asserts from blockchain-based data markets by leveraging time-delays, batch requests, anonymization, and virtual “one-time” users to form a layer of obfuscation around requests.}

	abstract = {Content distribution networks play a crucial role in the services provided by streaming applications, but current terrestrial CDNs have uneven coverage and poor performance in some remote and rural areas. Satellite communications have emerged as an effective way to address these issues. However, the satellite environment is highly dynamic, and how to reasonably deploy CDNs in the satellite constellation to realize efficient content caching and distribution is an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, this paper proposes a content caching and content distribution approach for satellite CDNs. The approach uses Lyapunov optimization, Gibbs sampling, and matching theory to control the traffic cost of satellite-cached content copies while reducing the content distribution latency. A cost-effective content cache deployment and distribution strategy is proposed for large low-orbiting satellite constellations operating at high speeds. Extensive simulation results show that the algorithm can quickly converge to favorable values compared to the reference algorithm, effectively reducing latency for end users while maintaining low deployment traffic costs.}

	abstract = {Today, the microservices paradigm has emerged as one of the most widely adopted patterns to develop, package, and deploy software on a large scale. However, as they were originally designed for the cloud, the direct application of microservices DevOps practices to resource-constrained environments like the Edge may not be optimal. Specifically, deploying each piece of software as an individual microservice may result in a significant resource footprint (e.g., storage space and network bandwidth related to managing base images, CPU, and memory). In this work, we explore the concept of opportunistically grouping microservice code within the same container to reduce resource footprint when deploying multiple microservices at the Edge. To materialize this concept, we present the N anoservices framework: a framework that formalizes and provides practical means for developers to build and deploy groups of microservices on the same container (a.k.a., Nanoservices). Our early results show that with Nanoservices we can achieve a significant resource footprint reduction (base image storage, CPU, memory) with minimal effort from the developer's viewpoint.}

To fill this gap, we introduce Lo W-Fi, a system architecture specifically designed to meet the requirements of battery-free IoT applications. We show the suitability of LoW-Fi for deploying monitoring systems for precision agriculture indoors. This sector is revolutionizing with the installation of smart greenhouses that require the constant monitoring of ambient parameters to ensure optimal conditions for the crops growth. Our system is implemented using commercial off-the-shelf devices, and it works at the intersection of WiFi and LiFi for downlink and RF backscatter for uplink, retaining the advantages of each technology and solving their practical limitations. We evaluate LoW-Fi performance in a real greenhouse, and the experimental results show that it can achieve an uplink (downlink) range of 45m(70m) with 0% BER. The aggregated data rate is up to 4.5 Mb/s.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with 5G networks enable unprecedented levels of scalability and performance in the computing industry. These enhanced performance features allow to offer and deploy a wide range of new use cases and services in scenarios such as Smart Cities, Smart Grid or Industry 5.0 just to mention a few. However, the inherent complexity of such networks is a serious concern in terms of security. Furthermore, the vulnerability and low-power constraints of IoT devices make such networks a targeted vector for cyber criminals. In this contribution, authors present an innovative topology-aware Cognitive Self-protection framework able to detect and mitigate attacks in an autonomous way with no human intervention in the wired segments of 5G-IoT multi-tenant networks. Preliminary tests carried out on a realistic emulated testbed show promising results in terms of time spent in stopping DDoS attacks (less than 47 seconds) and scalability for scenarios with different number of tenants and UEs (2 virtual tenants deployed in 4 Edge nodes and up to 64 IoT devices or sensors connected to the infrastructure).}

	abstract = {Although desirable, achieving a high-fidelity digital twin of buildings often requires a substantial influx of real-time data, demanding a dense network of environmental sensors. Regrettably, factors such as high hardware expenses, deployment constraints, and sensor malfunctions can impede the realization of such digital twins. In this demonstration, we introduce a pioneering approach that harnesses data-driven virtual sensing within a real-time, high-fidelity 3D digital twin of a building environment. Our innovative method provides accurate machine learning-based inference of real-time sensor variables across both two-dimensional (varying rooms) and three-dimensional (diverse elevations) domains, with limited reliance on physical sensor inputs. Thus, by extending the sensing coverage through the use of ML-driven virtual sensing, we are able to create a more accurate digital twin. Our initial results indicate a mean absolute percentage error of <1 % for temperature and around 10% for air quality parameters such as CO 2 , when compared against the ground truth physical sensors.}

	abstract = {The existing Internet treats all packets equally, which means that a packet can be dropped entirely due to network congestion. To address this issue, a new packetization scheme and transport paradigm called Qualitative Communication, along with its associated packet wash operation, have been proposed. Qualitative Communication is particularly beneficial for transmitting multimedia content in the presence of network congestion. This paper specifically focuses on the transmission of JPEG/MPEG packets and investigates the characteristics of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) used in the JPEG/MPEG encoding process. The proposed encoding scheme organizes the quantization coefficients of all image blocks in a packet based on their significance for image decoding and reconstruction. Additionally, the paper explores the idea that end users may be willing to accept a certain level of quality degradation rather than receiving nothing at all within an expected time frame. The benefits provided by the proposed mechanisms are discussed, and simulation results validate the improvements in the successful packet delivery ratio and the end user's level of satisfaction.}

	abstract = {Network specification, which describes what an existing network is designed for, can help operators better understand and manage their networks, and is a critical pre-condition for network verification and synthesis tools to work. Mining specification with existing tools either cannot scale to large networks, or scale better at a cost of sacrificing fidelity. This paper presents NetMiner, which can simultaneously achieve high scalability and fidelity. The key idea of NetMiner is to use off-the-shelf network simulators to compute routes, and then check properties with data plane verifiers, so as to achieve a high fidelity. At the same time, NetMiner improves the scalability by identifying relevant failure scenarios, and aggregating them to significantly reduce the number of needed simulations. This process is solely based on the routes returned by the simulators and therefore preserving fidelity. Experiments using real configurations from a large cloud service provider and synthetic configurations show that NetMiner is about 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advances in high-speed mobile networks such as 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and the upcoming 6G and Wi-Fi 7, streaming live video has become ubiquitous for mobile users. However, live video is susceptible to short-term network condition fluctuations which could lead to video stalls. Our investigations revealed that a substantial portion of such fluctuations were in fact caused by RTT spikes that were not congestion-related. These often confuse the transport protocol into dropping the transmission rate significantly, resulting in video stalls. This motivated us to develop a novel scheme called CWnd-loan to reduce the sender's CWnd-limited idle time during RTT spikes. We applied CWnd-loan to the QUIC protocol with BBR/CUBIC congestion control and strategically deployed it in a tier-1 live video service. The results show that CWnd-loan can effectively reduce sender CWnd-limited idle time by up to 18%, consequently reducing the duration and number of live video stalls by as much as 8.9% and 10.6%. Furthermore, CWnd-loan can also reduce the first-frame time and the playback failure rate by up to 3.2% and 2.7 % , respectively. CWnd-loan is designed to complement existing congestion control algorithms and thus could potentially be applied to current as well as future TCP/QUIC designs to tackle RTT spikes commonly found across mobile and wireless networks.}

	abstract = {Long Range-Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) is a novel wireless communication technology to improve the coverage of Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LP-WAN). But our measurement finds that given the same set of sub-channels, different Frequency Hopping Sequence (FHS) can result in a reliability difference of up to 52.6 % in terms of Packet Reception Rate (PRR). The key observation indicates that the reliability of LR-FHSS is significantly influenced by the FHS besides the link quality. Hence, in this paper, we propose DFH that takes both link quality and FHS into consideration to improve the reliability of LR-FHSS. We first propose using the hop Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), a new indicator to reflect the quality of the sub-channels and establish the PRR prediction model according to hop SNR and FHS. Based on the model, we design an interleaving-based search algorithm to decide the optimal FHS. We implement and evaluate DFH on the commercial transceivers and SDR-based gateway. The results of experiments in real environments show that DFH can improve the PRR by up to 2.76x, compared to the standard LR-FHSS.}

	abstract = {Approximate Membership Query (AMQ) filter is a group of probabilistic data structures, such as Bloom filter and cuckoo filter, which supports approximate set membership queries under constant memory budget and time cost. It has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, such as connection tracking and IP blacklisting for network management and security. However, dynamic datasets are pervasive in practice, with the number of elements fluctuating significantly over time. This requires an AMQ structure to support the run-time memory reallocation for dynamic set representation. Although previous works exist that enhance the cuckoo filter to be memory elastic, most of them only support coarse-grained memory expansion at the filter level or the mini-filter level. We propose a new AMQ filter named BECF (Bucket-level Elastic Cuckoo Filter) that allows fine-grained expansion and shrinkage at the bucket level. BECF combines cuckoo filter with consistent hashing technique, which one-to-one maps the buckets of a cuckoo filter to the segments of a hashring. To allow the number of segments to increase dynamically, BECF splits an arbitrary segment into two child segments, and adopts a segment re-addressing technique that borrows extra bits from element fingerprint to identify the child segment prefix. We also minimize the data movement between the parent and the child segments (or buckets), and preserve all the good properties of cuckoo filter after the expansion. Our experiments show that BECF attains 37% lower memory cost (while holding the same number of elements), 12% higher insertion speed and 20% faster query speed than other designs.}

	abstract = {A variety of model representation methods have been used in recent works to translate machine learning models into programmable switch rules to address network classification tasks at line-speed, i.e., in-network classification. These works generally deploy a complete but heavy model on a switch with limited hardware resources, causing both network-wide waste of resources and unsatisfactory accuracy. Therefore, we propose In-Forest, a general distributed in-network classification framework. Firstly, to improve accuracy with limited resources, we develop a Lightweight Ensemble Generic Optional Model (LEGO), which can be further enhanced into multiple enhanced base models with full functionality. Each switch only needs to deploy a simple base model, rather than the complete ensemble model. Thus, hardware resources required for both switches and the entire network can be significantly reduced. Secondly, as traffic traverses multiple switches, In-Forest aggregates the classification results from different enhanced base models for higher accuracy. Furthermore, we design a two-phase resource-aware model allocation strategy that assigns enhanced base models to switches under different scenarios. We use stable deep reinforcement learning to respond to dynamic traffic changes. Experimental results show that when compared to SwitchTree, Planter, and Netbeacon in two real network topologies, In-Forest can increase accuracy by up to 19.31%, while reducing the number of switch rules by 89.98%.}

	abstract = {Accurate per-flow counting is beyond the capability of network switches due to the sheer flow number. The conventional divide-and-conquer method by distributing the traffic to multiple servers for software processing is costly. The solution therefore quests for a combination of hardware and software where the hardware with limited resources aims to undertake a part of the job and reduce the workload of software, achieving a desirable balance of cost and performance. To this end we design FASTeller to be deployed on SmartNICs. It is tuned to maximize the counting aggregation level in hardware, leaving the server a much lower workload for accurate per-flow counting and sparing the server capacity for post-counting functions such as network intrusion detection. The novelty lies in the multi-tier hardware caching data structure which is tailored for the flow distribution properties of real traffic. We build an FPGA-based prototype and evaluate the performance of FASTeller. The low-cost implementation achieves the highest performance among the methods in comparison and can easily sustain the accurate perflow counting for 100Gbps traffic with the least software load.}

	abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) has been at-tracting attention as a network that efficiently transfers content such as internet of things (IoT). Named data networking (NDN) is one of the architectures in ICN. In NDN, access control by Publisher is difficult, and privacy leakage for content names is an issue. Although an existing access control method of NDN called name-based access control (NAC) solves the access control issue in the NDN, the problem of privacy leakage still remains. Moreover, although we can avoid privacy leakage by encrypting content names, the encrypted content name can be still identified by a frequency attack. Therefore, we propose an access control method at Publisher which always allows the first Interest to reach Publisher, protects privacy by encrypting content names, and reduces the impact of frequency attack by dynamically changing the encrypted content names. In the proposed method, however, the amount of control traffic will increase. Therefore, we compare the amount of control traffic of the proposed method with that of the NAC method. Moreover, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by evaluating its defense ability against the frequency attack.}

	abstract = {In spite of the advances in mobile networks, most mobile data plans impose a fixed monthly data quota, beyond which the attainable bandwidth is explicitly limited to a much lower data rate. This rate-limited behavior could degrade TCP performances significantly, as confirmed by a major service provider who observed strong correlation between high packet loss rate and mobile rate limiting. The high packet loss translates directly into increased bandwidth cost which is significant in a large-scale service. This work investigates this problem in two steps. First, we establish the link between the high loss rate observed and mobile network rate limiting through experiments in both controlled testbed and production mobile networks. The results revealed that packet loss can and does increase dramatically in rate-limited mobile networks. This affects both TCP Cubic and BBR, the two most widely deployed TCP implementations. BBR, in particular, was impacted far more significantly, resulting in packet loss rates exceeding 40% in some cases. Second, we analyzed BBR's operations under rate limiting to uncover the causes and developed new mechanisms - mBBR, to improve its performance. Experimental results show that mBBR can reduce BBR's packet loss rate by up to 88%, thereby saving substantial bandwidth costs incurred in retransmitting lost packets when the user is under rate limiting.}

	abstract = {Blockchain interoperability and throughput scalability are two crucial problems that limit the wide adoption of blockchain applications. Payment channel networks (PCNs) provide a promising solution to the inherent scalability problem of blockchain technologies, allowing off-chain payments between senders and receivers via multi-hop payment paths. This paper presents a cross-chain PCN, called XHub, that extends PfCNs to support multi-hop paths across multiple blockchains and resolves both interoperability and throughput scalability. XHub achieves service availability, transaction atomicity, and auditability. Users who correctly follow the protocols will succeed in making payments or get profits from doing the services. In addition, trustworthy information about hubs will be managed in a decentralized manner and available to all users. We conduct prototype implementation of machines that exchange Internet messages and run with two real blockchains as well as large-scale simulations based on real-world PCN topologies and transactions. The results show that XHubs has small latency for cross-chain payments and can achieve a significantly higher success rate compared to the version without hub management protocols. This work is an important step towards the big picture of a decentralized transaction system that connects a wide scope of users in different blockchains.}

	abstract = {Many mobile devices are usually equipped with multiple interfaces, providing the opportunity of using multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to boost performance. The multipath congestion control algorithm (CCA) in MPTCP plays a vital role in achieving high performance and multipath fairness in mobile environments where the paths are often heterogeneous and dynamic. Such environments are very challenging for existing one-size-fits-all CCAs to achieve high performance while ensuring multipath fairness. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Disco, to dynamically select the most appropriate CCAs for MPTCP subflows at runtime according to the perceived network condition. Extensive experiments show that compared with existing multipath CCAs, the proposed solution can improve the average throughput by 19% – 25% and reduce the average queuing delay by up to 21 % while it barely does harm to multipath fairness.}

Our method includes statistical observations related to communication bottlenecks and analyzes the relationship between communication performance and collision risk. We also refine the existing theo-retical framework for collision prediction to ensure compatibility with current protocols. To evaluate our proposed approach, we set up an environment with two vehicles operating at a fixed distance from each other and analyzed the correlation between communication strength and real-time deadline criticality in relation to collision risk.}

	abstract = {As a representative Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, LoRa is expected to connect devices for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Many IoT applications require both long-range communications and high precise sensing at the same time, while state of the art approaches fail to achieve this. We propose LoSense, which enables LoRa movement sensing alongside the regular data transmissions. LoSense recovers the fine-grained trajectory of a LoRa transmitter only based on its communication signals during the data transmission period. We address practical challenges for LoSense designs. We propose the active tracking model for detecting movements of active LoRa transmitters. We use dual antennas at the receiver to eliminate synchronization offsets between LoRa transmitters and the receiver. We design feature amplification and signal enhancement schemes to combat noise and interference. We prototype LoSense with commodity LoRa transmitters and USRP receivers, and extensively evaluate its performance. The results show that LoSense tracks movements of active LoRa transmitters with 2.32 cm distance accuracy and 0.089 Hz frequency accuracy from a sensing range of 150m, supporting regular data communication at the same time.}

	abstract = {Various datacenter network (DCN) load balancing schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Unfortunately, most of these solutions designed for lossy DCNs do not work well for Priority Flow Control (PFC) enabled lossless DCNs, primarily due to the reason that the individual congestion signals used in these solutions, e.g., link load, queue length, Round Trip Time (RTT) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), may not be able to correctly or timely reflect the hop-by-hop PFC pausing. This paper first reveals the above problems via extensive experiments, and then based on the insights learned, we present Proteus, a PFC-aware load balancing scheme that is resilient to PFC pausing by exploring a combination of multi-level congestion signals. At its heart, Proteus leverages RTT-Ievel signals (i.e., RTT and link utilization) to detect path status for initial routing decision, and exploits sub-RTT level signal (i.e., cumulative sojourn time) to reflect instantaneous PFC pausing and make timely rerouting choices based on the idea of better-late-than-never. We have implemented Proteus in the hardware programmable switch. Our testbed experiments as well as large-scale simulations show that Proteus can effectively handle PFC pausing under realistic workloads and achieve up to 35 %, 31 %, 28%, 22% and 46 %, 42 %, 34 %, 29 % better average FCT and 99 th percentile FCT than CONGA, DRILL, Hermes and MP-RDMA, respectively.}

	abstract = {Serverless architectures abstract resource provisioning away from the user. However, this property may be at odds with performance. One example of this is Function as a Service (FaaS), where the lack of network addressability compels developers to resort to serverless storage services such as AWS S3 to share (intermediate) data between the functions. For IO-bound workflows, the literature has shown that the performance of parallel reads and writes highly depends on the level of parallelism. Simply put, both an excess or a deficiency in the number of functions may lead to longer IO times. The good news is that the provisioning of functions is fast. Consequently, it is feasible to auto-provision the serverless functions to the optimal number to minimize IO latency. For this, the performance of object storage must be predictable and consistent. We confirmed this in the past for IBM COS. And in this paper, we show that the same occurs to AWS S3. Concretely, we prove that the optimal level of parallelism for parallel reads and writes can be approximated analytically for AWS S3.}

	abstract = {Remote Direct Memory Access has been widely adopted in distributed storage systems. However, it only supports unicast operations, which degrades the performance significantly for data replication because of bandwidth waste and CPU overhead. To address the problem, we propose MC-RDMA, a distributed and reliable multicast RDMA. It is compatible with existing unicast RDMA but supports lazy packet replication with reliable RDMA multicasting. The key idea of MC-RDMA is utilizing in-network programmable switches to build a NIC-transparent reliable multicast protocol for RDMA. MC-RDMA combines the address information of the IP and RoCEv2 into a sender-initialized multicast routing protocol. Besides, it synchronizes the hardware transmission states of multiple receivers by merging ACKs and NAKs. To verify the effectiveness of MC-RDMA, we implement it with Mellanox ConnectX-6 commodity RNICs and Intel Tofino P4 programmable switches. Experimental results show that MC-RDMA can double the sender bandwidth utilization and reduce the CPU overhead significantly compared to unicast-based RDMA replications. Moreover, it reduces the storage request latency by -30% with realistic workloads and decreases the training time by -50% in the distributed training system.}

	abstract = {The advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques have enabled the development of semantic communication systems by their remarkable information processing and end - to-end optimization capabilities. However, the lack of performance guarantee of these DL-based methods also brings concerns on the reliability of semantic communication systems. To address this issue, we propose a semantic communication scheme with reliability-driven retransmission requests in order to improve the transmission efficiency and guarantee the reliability of the inference result at the same time. In particular, the transmitter first sends a basic amount of the information, and the receiver infers with this information, and assesses the reliability of the results. If the derived reliability is below a given threshold, a retransmission request is sent to the sender for more information to be transmitted. We exploit the entropy of the output logits to quantify the reliability of the classification results. More specifically, lower entropy corresponds to higher confidence, indicating higher reliability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of improving transmission efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining the reliability of the inference results.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be divided into two main categories: resource-rich devices such as smart TVs, fitness machines and connected vehicles; and resource-constrained such as low-battery body sensors, pacemakers or bridge monitoring sensors. This work focuses on the second type of devices, which usually have low computing power and/or demanding energy-consumption restrictions (e.g. unable to be charged frequently). It presents three lightweight approaches to provide constrained IoT devices with strong authentication by leveraging the trust in the cellular network and associated standard authentication mechanisms. Furthermore, leveraging the secure communication between cellular devices and the core network, two proposed solutions introduce as well a core network broker that secures the communication of constrained IoT devices that don't have capabilities establish/use secure channels.}

	abstract = {Governments provide critical services to the residents they serve such as voting information, taxes, and health services. In turn, residents must trust information coming from their governments is legitimate. This paper examines the adoption of three DNS records, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA), with governments in the United States. All three DNS records help establish legitimacy in a server's identity. From February to July 2023, SPF, DMARC, and CAA records from domains belonging to governments in the U.S. were collected, parsed, and semantically analyzed for security misconfigurations. We have developed an open source parser and analyzer to verify the syntax and security configuration of SPF and DMARC records. We found that adoption of all three records is slowly increasing, however errors and misconfigurations are disproportionately found in local, county, and state government domains.}

	abstract = {Access Control List (ACL) policies often need to be updated due to upgrades in network architecture and services. A critical part of ACL update tasks is reachability satisfaction, which is typically handled using Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) or Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. However, as modern networks grow in size and complexity, the constraints derived from reachability requirements become increasingly complex, resulting in a considerable time cost to obtain a satisfying policy. The slow update of ACL policies can endanger network connectivity and security. This paper presents a new approach for fast and scalable ACL policy synthesis under complex constraints. We leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the relations between nodes and reason the solution that satisfies the update requirements. In addition, an enhanced stochastic local search solver is introduced to deal with erroneous predictions of the GNN. Evaluations show that the proposed method guarantees 100% accuracy on real-world topologies. GNN outperforms modern SAT/SMT solvers in speed, saving up to 278x time costs on a 125-node topology. Furthermore, our method extrapolates well when faced with different requirements and topologies.}

	abstract = {By offering long-range wireless connections with low energy consumption, Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP- WANs) have been widely deployed in many critical Internet-of- Things (IoT) applications. However, LPWAN's low-power nature leads to inevitable packet corruption under cross-technology interference (CTI) emitted from other wireless technologies that coexist in the same unlicensed band. To address this fundamental issue, researchers propose multiple lines of solutions, such as signal analysis and coding. Despite these efforts, the research on CTI mitigation needs to go one step further - to design a systematic framework for enhanced interference resilience. This paper introduces SLoRa, a systematic framework inte-grating symbol recovery with soft decoding for synergic inter-ference resilience. Without loss of generality, we focus on LoRa, the dominating LPWAN technology. SLoRa's symbol recovery examines the corrupted signal through a two-stage analysis to recover incorrect LoRa symbols accurately at a low cost. To estimate the confidence of recovered symbols, SLoRa examines the statuses of LoRa and CTI, and it further leverages the estimated confidence via soft decoding to improve the error correction capability. We analyze SLoRa theoretically and evaluate it with real testbeds, including SX1280 LoRa chips and USRP B210. Experiments across multiple settings, e.g., different CTI sources and frequency bands, demonstrate that SLoRa effectively enhances interference resilience at a low cost. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique, SLoRa improves the CTI protection capability by 1.4x while only requiring 1 % computation cost.}

The most widely used one, the Lightning Network (LN), has developed rapidly since its introduction in 2015. While much research has been dedicated to improving LN's routing efficiency, security protocols, and network analysis, there remains a gap in understanding how end-users should establish channels to optimize transaction efficiency. In this work, we conduct a holistic measurement study that focuses on the practical aspects of Lightning Network transaction performance. By evaluating transaction latency, fees, and success rates under diverse sce-narios, we provide users with actionable insights to enhance their network efficiency. Furthermore, our research aids those interested in leveraging the LN for transaction relaying, fostering a more efficient and dynamic network ecosystem. Through empirical findings and analytical deductions, we pave the way for users to harness the full potential of the Lightning Network and contribute to its ongoing growth and development.}

	abstract = {Device-free wireless sensing has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential to support a wide range of immersive human-machine interactive applications. However, data heterogeneity in wireless signals and data privacy regulation of distributed sensing have been considered as the major challenges that hinder the wide applications of wireless sensing in large area networking systems. Motivated by the observation that signals recorded by wireless receivers are closely related to a set of physical-layer semantic features, in this paper we propose a novel zero-shot wireless sensing solution that allows models constructed in one or a limited number of locations to be directly transferred to other locations without any labeled data. We develop a novel physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN) framework to characterize the correlation between physical-layer semantic features and the sensing data distributions across different receivers. We then propose a pSAN-based zero-shot learning solution in which each receiver can obtain a location-specific gesture recognition model by directly aggregating the already constructed models of other receivers. We theoretically prove that models obtained by our proposed solution can approach the optimal model without requiring any local model training. Experimental results once again verify that the accuracy of models derived by our proposed solution matches that of the models trained by the real labeled data based on supervised learning approach.}

	abstract = {Advancements in the domain of Synchronous- Transmission (ST) have brought a drastic improvement in the all-to-all data-sharing strategies in low-power wireless distributed systems. However, in the current design of the ST-based protocols, the inability of overhearing from the neighbors, and the lack of simultaneous system-wide commencement of the target process act as major bottlenecks in the faster percolation of data. The physical layer phenomena Capture-Effect (CE) is considered to be one of the fundamental strengths of ST. However, since the scope of CE largely depends on network topology, an ST-based protocol also mostly fail to exploit the full benefit of CE. Existing strategies try to exploit the topology information implicitly through on-the-fly exploration which, however, results in only partial advantage. In this work, we first introduce a few fundamental design ingredients to accelerate the percolation of data. Next, we propose a TDMA-based self-adaptive all-to-all data-sharing strategy SyncCast which explicitly learns the topology of the underlying network in real-time, and then on-the-fly optimizes the transmission plans to maximize the advantage from CE. Through extensive experiments in IoT-testbeds we demonstrate that despite being simple, SyncCast is upto 65 % faster and consumes 74% less Radio-on time compared to the existing state-of-the-art solution for all-to-all data-sharing.}

	abstract = {Decision trees (DT) have been used for high-speed networking classification on programmable switches. Most DT solutions, however, are static and cannot be deployed once the switch resource changes. In this paper, we propose Dryad to fast reprogram tree models when resource budgets change. In Dryad, we first develop a large and accurate “one-training-for-all“ DT (ODT) that can be quickly resized without computational retraining. ODTs are deployed in switches using a progressive search algorithm that searches the adaptations according to their resources. To achieve high accuracy and low packet latency, the adaptation leverages 1) innovative hard and soft pruning methods to compress the ODT rapidly with minimal performance loss; and 2) P4 scaling operations of match-action table arrangement and joint range-ternary match, which allow the switch to accommodate a larger (i.e., more accurate) ODT. Finally, an ODTCompiler is proposed to automatically convert the adapted ODT into a P4 program and then install it. Experimental results on three commodity switches under different resource scenarios show that Dryad achieves a higher classification F1-score (3.78 % higher), and completes the adaptation 161 × faster than other solutions.}

	abstract = {Among the routing protocols deployed in the wired infrastructure of the Internet, the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) has the distinction of being the only one that guarantees loop-free routing of data-packets during transient periods of convergence. However, there is no good proof of this fact and no knowledge of whether the actions and behaviors of EIGRP extend beyond its specific composite metric combining delay and bandwidth. This paper generalizes EIGRP for operation with arbitrary metrics and policies. It shows that generalized-EIGRP (gEIGRP) can be used with a broad class of such metrics and policies, but less so than the protocol to which it is closest in kind, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). To reason reliably about the behaviors induced by the actions of gEIGRP, the paper resorts to assertional proof methods. For the class of routing metrics and policies mentioned above, it presents an invariant of gEIGRP from which two safety properties are deduced: loop-free routing at all times, and routing on destination-optimal paths in stable state. Outside that class of metrics and policies, gEIGRP may deadlock in states harboring persistent forwarding loops.}

	abstract = {RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv2) has been widely deployed to data centers (DCs) for its better compatibility with Ethernet/IP than Infiniband (IB). As cross-DC applications emerge, they also demand high throughput, low latency, and lossless network for cross-DC data transmission. However, RoCEv2's underlying lossless mechanism Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) cannot fit into the long-haul transmission scenario and degrades the performance of RoCEv2. PFC is myopic and only considers queue length to pause upstream senders, which leads to large queueing delay. This paper proposes Bifrost, a downstream-driven lossless flow control that supports long distance cross-DC data transmission. Bifrost uses virtual incoming packets, which indicates the upper bound of in-flight packets, together with buffered packets to control the flow rate. It minimizes the buffer space requirement to one-hop bandwidth delay product (BDP) and achieves low one-way latency. Real-world experiments are conducted with prototype switches and 80 kilometers cables. Evaluations demonstrate that compared to PFC, Bifrost reduces average/tail flow completion time (FCT) of inter-DC flows by up to 22.5%/42.0%, respectively. Bifrost is compatible with existing infrastructure and can support distance of thousands of kilometers.}

	abstract = {The In-band Network Telemetry (INT) provides unprecedented network visibility by encapsulating fine-grained device-internal status into packet headers. Existing efforts proposed to reduce the telemetry cost can either monitor a small part of flows and links, or require complex calculation supported by programmable switches. In this paper, we propose SD-INT (Self-Driving INT), a lightweight network-wide passive INT system, which can be readily deployed based on commodity switches. The key idea of SD-INT is to reduce two dimensions of redundancy in the INT data which we have observed. Furthermore, the optimized INT is conducted in a self-driving system, adjusting the INT strategy according to the feedback of INT result history. In addition to the mechanism, we design the latency-hiding technology and a suite of efficient algorithms for flow selection and sampling ratio adaptation. These designs enable us to keep the monitoring overhead under a reasonable level, while still collecting network-wide fine-grained telemetry data. Further, we prototype and evaluate SD-INT with both large-scale simulations and testbed deployment. Experiments for both TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) and RDMA(Remote Direct Memory Access) flows show that SD-INT reduces orders of magnitude data volume while achieves similar link coverage compared with INT. Besides, compared with the relevant technologies based on programmable switches, SD-INT is competitive in reducing the data volume.}

	abstract = {Large-scale machine learning typically adopts distributed machine learning (DML) techniques to accelerate model training. Due to the large communication overhead, unfortu-nately, the phase of gradient aggregation has become the performance bottleneck for DML. To reduce traffic volume, several in-network aggregation (INA) transmission protocols are proposed to offload gradient aggregation function into the programmable switches. However, since existing INA transmission protocols use synchronous congestion control mechanism to drive each round of gradient aggregation, the straggling workers lead to long iteration time and significant performance degradation. To solve the above problem, we propose PA-ATP, a progress-aware INA transmission protocol, which adopts the progress-aware asynchronous congestion control. PA-ATP adjusts the sending rate in accordance with the transmission progress, allowing the straggling flow to grab more bandwidth than the leading flow and control the asynchronous degree of straggling job. We use a P4 programmable switch and a kernel-bypass protocol stack to implement PA-ATP. The results of testbed and large-scale NS3 simulations show that PA-ATP reduces training time by up to 62% compared to the state-of-the-art INA transmission protocols.}

	abstract = {Space networks composed of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites play a significant role in Earth observation systems. LEO satellite constellations, which provide wide-ranging coverage, continuously observe the Earth and transmit the observed data to satellites in higher orbits or ground stations for further analysis, benefiting from their more powerful computation capacity. In such an observation and analysis network, the timeliness of data update and the quality of analysis are crucial factors, both constrained by limited energy resources. In this paper, we jointly optimize the timeliness and analysis quality by constructing an update scheduling problem with a trade-off between Age of Information (AoI) and accuracy. Considering the unpredictable and changeable environment dynamics, we formulate this problem into a Markov decision process and propose an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to obtain an optimal policy that effectively tackles the tradeoff problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can jointly reduce AoI and increase accuracy, outperforming benchmark algorithms in different cases.}

	abstract = {Recent research has proposed that Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can use better bandwidth allocation to improve video streaming services through congested links. Because CDNs are usually not located at the bottleneck link, shared bottleneck (co-bottleneck) detection on the video servers is necessary for joint flow shaping and the Quality of Experience (QoE) improvements. However, co-bottleneck detection is challenging in such environments due to the large number of flows, possible network topologies, and traffic patterns. Current detectors fail to balance detection accuracy, speed and overhead, and suffer performance degradation in the scale of thousands of flows on each video server. We propose FlowBot, a novel model-based passive co-bottleneck detector designed for deployment on a video server. FlowBot uses Siamese model to learn flow representations, and combines the training procedure with its clustering algorithm to continue to provide strong performance with up to thousands of flows. Our evaluations show that FlowBot can achieve consistently high accuracy (over 70% F1 with around 90% precision) in most tested scenarios, while maintaining a short detection delay of 3 s and overhead similar to the fastest benchmark algorithms.}

In this study, we improve the communication performance at different bottleneck link buffer sizes using Round Trip Time (RTT) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) when CUBIC and BBR compete within QUIC through actual experiments.}

	abstract = {Remote driving, an emergent technology enabling remote operation of vehicles, presents a significant challenge due to the necessity of transmitting substantial volumes of image data from the vehicle to a central server. This requirement outpaces the capacity of traditional communication methods, emphasizing the need for efficient data communication. We propose a framework using semantic communication, specifically through a semantic segmentation-based method, which reduces the communication cost by transmitting meaningful semantic information rather than bit-wise data. Addressing the challenge of inconsistencies across knowledge bases in semantic communication, we present a blockchain-based, edge-assisted knowledge base management system. This system leverages edge nodes to manage multiple, geographically and contextually diverse knowledge bases while ensuring security through blockchain's tamper-resistant nature. Furthermore, blockchain sharding is employed to manage different knowledge bases for varying tasks, thereby enhancing the blockchain's throughput. Experimental results showed a great reduction in latency by sharding and an increase in model accuracy, confirming our framework's effectiveness.}

	abstract = {In recent years, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have witnessed rapid development, with inference based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) models emerging as the prevailing technology for remote sensing satellite image recognition. However, the substantial computation capability and energy demands of DNN models, coupled with the instability of the satellite-ground link, pose significant challenges, burdening satellites with limited power intake and hindering the timely completion of tasks. Existing approaches, such as transmitting all images to the ground for processing or executing DNN models on the satellite, is unable to effectively address this issue. By exploiting the internal hierarchical structure of DNNs and treating each layer as an independent subtask, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative computation partial offloading approach to address this challenge. We formulate the problem of minimizing the inference task execution time and onboard energy consumption through offloading as an integer linear programming (ILP) model. The complexity in solving the problem arises from the combinatorial explosion in the discrete solution space. To address this, we have designed an improved optimization algorithm based on branch and bound. Simulation results illustrate that, compared to the existing approaches, our algorithm improve the performance by 10%-18%.}

	abstract = {Traditional Traffic Engineering (TE) usually balances the load on network links by formulating and solving a routing optimization problem based on measured Traffic Matrices (TMs). Given that traffic demands could change unexpectedly and significantly in realistic scenarios, routing strategies opti-mized based on currently measured TMs might not work well in future traffic scenarios. To compensate for the mismatch between stale routing decisions and future TMs, network operators may perform routing updates more frequently, which could introduce significant network disturbance and service disruption. Moreover, given the high routing computation overhead of TE optimization in today's large-scale networks, routing updates could experience severe delay and thus cannot accommodate future traffic changes in time. To address these challenges, we propose Roracle, a scalable learning-based TE that quickly predicts a good routing strategy for a long sequence of future TMs, while the learning process is guided by the optimal solutions of Linear Programming (LP) problems using Supervised Learning (SL). We design a scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that greatly facilitates training and inference processes to accelerate TE in large networks. Extensive simulation results on real-world network topologies and traffic traces show that Roracle outperforms existing TE solutions by up to 36% in terms of worst-case performance under future unknown traffic scenarios. Additionally, Roracle achieves good scalability by providing at least 71\\times speedup over the most efficient baseline method in large-scale networks.}

	abstract = {Packet losses significantly impact the user experience of wide-area applications such as content distribution and remote procedure call (RPC) based services. However, our production network measurement studies show that the legacy loss recovery is far from satisfactory due to the wide-area loss characteristics (i.e., dynamics and burstiness) in the wild. In this paper, we propose a sender-side Adaptive ReTransmission scheme, ART, which minimizes the recovery time of lost packets with minimal redundancy cost. Distinguishing itself from forward-error-correction (FEC), which preemptively sends redundant data packets to prevent loss, ART functions as an automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) scheme. It applies redundancy specifically to lost packets instead of unlost packets, thereby addressing the characteristic patterns of wide-area losses in real-world scenarios. We implement ART upon QUIC protocol and evaluate it via both trace-driven emulation and real-world deployment. The results show that ART reduces up to 34% of flow completion time (FCT) for delay-sensitive transmissions, improves up to 28 % of goodput for throughput-intensive transmissions, and saves up to 90% of redundancy cost.}
