	abstract = {Nakamoto introduced a mechanism for leader election via proof of work, and allowed this dealer to speak once. In this setting parties do not have inputs and they output a value which they calculated. Jing and Micali took this idea a step further and showed that Byzantine agreement, a function where parties have inputs but no private information, can be reached in a setting where each party speaks only once. This was achieved by introducing the notion of player replaceability. In our recent works we have shown that any function, including those where parties have secret inputs, can be computed in the YOSO (you only speak once) model.

	abstract = {SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is the most widely deployed 2FA mechanism, despite the fact that SMS messages are known to be vulnerable to rerouting attacks, and despite the availability of alternatives that may be more secure. This is for two reasons. First, it is very effective in practice, as evidenced by reports from Google and Microsoft. Second, users prefer SMS over alternatives, because text messaging is already part of their daily communication. Accepting this practical reality, we developed a new SMS-based protocol that makes rerouting attacks useless to adversaries who aim to take over user accounts. Our protocol delivers one-time passwords (OTP) via text message in a manner that adds minimal overhead (to both the user and the server) over existing SMS-based methods, and is implemented with only small changes to the stock text-message applications that already ship on mobile phones. The security of our protocol rests upon a provably secure authenticated key exchange protocol that, crucially, does not place significant new burdens upon the user. Indeed, we carry out a user study that demonstrates no statistically significant difference between traditional SMS and our protocol, in terms of usability.}

	abstract = {Multi-key homomorphic MACs (MKHomMACs) allow multiple clients to authenticate data with their own secret keys and outsource their data together with the tags to an untrusted server. Upon receiving any user 's request of computing a function on the data, the server is able to generate both the computation result and a short tag that vouches for the correctness of the result. MKHomMACs provide a solution with minimal communication and interaction to the problem of delegating computations over outsourced data. Fiore, Mitrokotsa, Nizzardo, and Pagnin (Asiacrypt 2016) constructed a PRF-based MKHomMAC where the result verification could be as costly as the delegated computation. In this paper, we show a PRF-based MKHomMAC for quadratic arithmetic circuits such that the verification can be substantially faster than the delegated computation in an amortized setting. The efficiency improvement is achieved by using PRFs with multi-key amortized closed-form efficiency.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of a client querying an encrypted binary tree structure, outsourced to an untrusted server. While the server must not learn the contents of the binary tree, we also prevent the client from maliciously crafting a query that traverses the tree out-of-order. That is, the client should not be able to retrieve nodes outside one contiguous path from the root to a leaf. Finally, the server should not learn which path the client accesses, but is guaranteed that the access corresponds to one valid path in the tree. This is an extension of protocols such as structured encryption, where it is only guaranteed that the tree's encrypted data remains hidden from the server. To this end, we initiate the study of Iterative Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (iOPRFs), new primitives providing two-sided, fully malicious security for these types of applications. We present a first, efficient iOPRF construction secure against both malicious clients and servers in the standard model, based on the DDH assumption. We demonstrate that iOPRFs are useful to implement different interesting applications, including an RFID authentication protocol and a protocol for private evaluation of outsourced decision trees. Finally, we implement and evaluate our full iOPRF construction and show that it is efficient in practice.}

	abstract = {In this work, we present the first leakage-resilient identity-based encryption (LR-IBE) scheme that features (almost) tight security under the multi-challenge setting, in which the adversary could receive multiple challenging ciphertexts from multiple users. Meanwhile, our construction enjoys security against chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) under the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. Apart from admitting the continual leakage of secret key, we provide strong security via additionally allowing the continual leakage of the master secret key. In particular, albeit in the single-challenge setting, our LR-IBE is also the first tight and CCA-secure scheme that withstands continual leakage of the master secret key and identity secret key. Furthermore, our ciphertext is constant-size when we instantiate the scheme by the Symmetric external Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) assumption. Concretely, there are only 6 group elements with security against chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) and extra 14 group elements for the CCA security.}

	abstract = {Flash memory has been used extensively as external storage of smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, laptops, etc. Therefore, more and more sensitive or even mission critical data are stored in flash and, once the data turn obsolete, securely deleting them is necessary for both regulation compliance and privacy protection. Traditional secure deletion on flash memory mainly focuses on sanitizing data. However, unique nature of flash memory may cause various data ''remnants'' and, even though the data are removed, the remnants may be utilized by the adversary to recover the deleted data, compromising the secure deletion guarantee. Based on both theoretic analysis and experiments using real-world workloads, we have identified one common type of remnants in the flash memory, namely duplicates, which are caused by unique internal functions of flash storage media including garbage collection, wear leveling, bad block management. We propose RedFlash, a novel secure deletion scheme which can efficiently Remove both the data and the corresponding duplicates towards secure deletion on Flash memory. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that RedFlash can ensure the secure deletion guarantee, at the cost of a small performance degradation, compared to a regular (non-secure) flash controller.}

	abstract = {Sound waves from speech can potentially induce vibrations, proportional to the speech signal, on nearby objects. Each of these objects introduces the risk for a malicious attacker to exploit the induced vibrations to eavesdrop on the speech. Such an eavesdropping attack is critical when we consider the potential for induced vibrations in standard magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs). As an instance of this threat, prior research has demonstrated that speech in certain scenarios can induce vibrations on the read/write head of an HDD in order to eavesdrop on the speech (Kwong et al.; Oakland'19). In this paper, we revisit this line of research and aim to provide a closer investigation into whether HDDs can in fact be used as a source for eavesdropping on speech vibrations. As a foundation for our study, we utilize an effective, and robust methodology using laser vibrometry to measure the subtle speech vibrations induced on the read/write head. The prior study tested only a single HDD and only machine-rendered speech in a single setting with very loud speech. Our work broadens the scope of this research in many significant ways. First, we test multiple popular HDDs of different models and sizes to evaluate the generalizability of the overall threat. Second, we evaluate the threat from live human speech spoken near an HDD, expanding the scope of the attack to include most real-world speech settings involving normal human conversations. Third, we define machine-rendered speech scenarios to explore different propagation media and degrees of speech loudness. Our findings are two-fold. First, we observed that live human speech traveling through the air is not generally strong enough to impact HDDs such that intelligible speech information is leaked. Second, most tested HDDs did not seem capable of eavesdropping on machine-rendered speech unless the speech is loud enough, or the HDD shares a surface or is in direct contact with the speaker device. This implies HDDs cannot eavesdrop live human speech.}

	abstract = {Cross-device tracking has drawn growing attention from both commercial companies and the general public because of its privacy implications and applications for user profiling, personalized services, etc. One particular, wide-used type of cross-device tracking is to leverage browsing histories of user devices, e.g., characterized by a list of IP addresses used by the devices and domains visited by the devices. However, existing browsing history based methods have three drawbacks. First, they cannot capture latent correlations among IPs and domains. Second, their performance degrades significantly when labeled device pairs are unavailable. Lastly, they are not robust to uncertainties in linking browsing histories to devices. We propose GraphTrack, a graph-based cross-device tracking framework, to track users across different devices by correlating their browsing histories. Specifically, we propose to model the complex interplays among IPs, domains, and devices as graphs and capture the latent correlations between IPs and between domains. We construct graphs that are robust to uncertainties in linking browsing histories to devices. Moreover, we adapt random walk with restart to compute similarity scores between devices based on the graphs. GraphTrack leverages the similarity scores to perform cross-device tracking. GraphTrack does not require labeled device pairs and can incorporate them if available. We evaluate GraphTrack on two real-world datasets, i.e., a publicly available mobile-desktop tracking dataset (around 100 users) and a multiple-device tracking dataset (154K users) we collected. Our results show that GraphTrack substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on both datasets.}

	abstract = {Advanced cyberattacks are carried out in multiple stages, where each stage performs a specific task corresponding to the campaign. While these steps are designed to blend in with benign activities, they leave their activity footprints across multiple logs on the machines inside the victim environment. The majority of these footprints when looked at in isolation seem benign to the activity monitors. Existing threat hunting systems require a significant amount of human effort to correlate these events in order to detect and reconstruct an attack campaign. This paper introduces SteinerLog, an end-to-end system to automate the task of correlating the alerts to detect ongoing attack campaigns within an enterprise network. SteinerLog takes the alerts generated by mature intelligence-based and anomaly-based alerting systems and uses causal analysis to extract the group of events that are most likely to represent the attackers' activities. It performs hierarchical graph traversal to perform cross-host attacker activity correlation, which includes detecting the compromised entities, reconstructing the attackers' steps, and abstracting them into easy-to-understand attack graphs. The experiments show that it is able to detect APT campaigns in real-time and scale to an enterprise system with hundreds of workstations.}

	abstract = {Strategic evaluations of blockchain systems allow a better understanding of the security of the mining process. In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing optimal strategies to evaluate the impact of an adversary on the mining process using different attack situations such as selfish mining, double-spending, feather-forking, Denial of Service. These strategies rely on the use of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find optimal settings that an adversary can exploit to earn maximum profit in every round. However, these strategies do not consider a case where adversaries turn abusive, and their only aim is to harm the mining process without profit. Motivated by this, a self-defying adversary model is proposed that uses ZEBRA (Zero Expectation-Based Reward Abuse) strategy to cause a maximum impact on the rewards of the honest players at lower settings. With the proposed method, the adversary itself may not be profitable, but has better control over the chain growth and causes maximum damage to reward by delaying the blocks and inducing forks subject to its compliance degree. The evaluations are demonstrated to show the reward control by the adversary along with the impact on delays and forks, followed by the possibilities of attacks using the hashing powers of different mining pools.}

	abstract = {Proof of Authority (PoA) is a type of permissioned consensus algorithm with a fixed committee. PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due to its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the unfairness issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have investigated 2,500+ in the wild projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two types of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level (a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering) fairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-profitable sealer assumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the forked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the attacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021), the potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to 681,087 million USD. Besides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and accordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix. To the best of knowledge, this work provides the first exploration of the unfairness issue in PoA algorithms.}

	abstract = {Payment channels have been a promising solution to blockchain scalability. While payment channels for script-empowered blockchains (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) have been well studied, developing payment channels for scriptless blockchains (such as Monero) is considered challenging. In particular, nabling bidirectional payment on scriptless blockchains remains an open challenge. This work closes this gap by providing AuxChannel, the first bi-directional payment channel protocol for scriptless blockchains, meaning that building payment channels only requires the support of verifiably encrypted signature (aka adaptor signature) on the underlying blockchain. AuxChannel leverages verifiably encrypted signature to create a commitment for each off-chain payment and deploys a verifiable decentralised key escrow service to resolve dispute. To enable efficient construction of AuxChannel, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, named Consecutive Verifiably Encrypted Signature (CVES), as a core building block and it can also be of independent interest for other applications. We provide and implement a provably secure instantiation on Schnorr-based CVES. We also provide a formal security analysis on the security of the AuxChannel.}

	abstract = {Predatory trading bots lurking in Ethereum's mempool present invisible taxation of traders on automated market makers (AMMs). AMM traders specify a slippage tolerance to indicate the maximum price movement they are willing to accept. This way, traders avoid automatic transaction failure in case of small price movements before their trade request executes. However, while a too-small slippage tolerance may lead to trade failures, a too-large slippage tolerance allows predatory trading bots to profit from sandwich attacks. These bots can extract the difference between the slippage tolerance and the actual price movement as profit. In this work, we introduce the sandwich game to analyze sandwich attacks analytically from both the attacker and victim perspectives. Moreover, we provide a simple and highly effective algorithm that traders can use to set the slippage tolerance. We unveil that most broadcasted transactions can avoid sandwich attacks while simultaneously only experiencing a low risk of transaction failure. Thereby, we demonstrate that a constant auto-slippage cannot adjust to varying trade sizes and pool characteristics. Our algorithm outperforms the constant auto-slippage suggested by the biggest AMM, Uniswap, in all performed tests. Specifically, our algorithm repeatedly demonstrates a cost reduction exceeding a factor of 100.}

	abstract = {It is impossible to solve the Byzantine consensus problem in an open network of n participants if only 2n/3 or less of them are correct. As blockchains need to solve consensus, one might think that blockchains need more than 2n/3 correct participants. But it is yet unknown whether consensus can be solved when less than 2n/3 participants are correct and k participants are rational players, which misbehave if they can gain the loot. Trading correct participants for rational players may not seem helpful to solve consensus since rational players can misbehave whereas correct participants, by definition, cannot. In this paper, we show that consensus is actually solvable in this model, even with less than 2n/3 correct participants. The key idea is a baiting strategy that lets rational players pretend to misbehave in joining a coalition but rewards them to betray this coalition before the loot gets stolen. We propose Trap, a protocol that builds upon recent advances in the theory of accountability to solve consensus as soon as n >max 〈3 over 2 (k +3t,2) 〉 where no coalition of k rational players can coordinate to increase their expected utility regardless of the arbitrary behavior of up to t Byzantine players. Finally, we show that a baiting strategy is necessary and sufficient to solve this, so-called rational agreement problem. First, we show that it is impossible to solve this rational agreement problem without implementing a baiting strategy. Second, the existence of Trap demonstrates the sufficiency of the baiting strategy. Our Trap protocol finds applications in blockchains to prevent players from disagreeing, that could otherwise lead to "double spending\'\'.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the security of the Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) protocol by proposing the VWAnalyzer framework. We model five critical procedures of the VoWiFi protocol and deploy a model-based testing approach to uncover potential design flaws. Since the standards of the VoWiFi protocol contain underspecifications that can lead to vulnerable scenarios, VWAnalyzer explicitly deals with them. Unlike prior approaches that do not consider the underspecifications, VWAnalyzer adopts a systematic approach that constructs diverse and viable scenarios based on the underspecifications and substantially reduces the number of possible scenarios. Then the scenarios are verified against security properties. VWAnalyzer automatically generates 960 viable scenarios to be analyzed among 10,368 scenarios (91% decrease) from the initial models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VWAnalyzer by verifying 38 properties and uncovering 3 new attacks. Notable among our findings is the denial-of-cellular-connectivity attack, due to insecure handover that disconnects the user through both VoWiFi and VoLTE. To ensure that the exposed attacks pose real threats and are indeed realizable in practice, we have validated the attacks in a real-world testbed. We also report several implementations issues that were uncovered during the testbed evaluation.}

	abstract = {Bluetooth is a pervasive wireless technology specified in an open standard. The standard defines Bluetooth Classic (BT) for high-throughput wireless services and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) very low-power ones. The standard also specifies security mechanisms, such as pairing, session establishment, and cross-transport key derivation (CTKD). CTKD enables devices to establish BT and BLE security keys by pairing just once. CTKD was introduced in 2014 with Bluetooth 4.2 to improve usability. However, the security implications of CTKD were not studied carefully. This work demonstrates that CTKD is a valuable and novel Bluetooth attack surface. It enables, among others, to exploit BT and BLE just by targeting one of the two (i.e., Bluetooth cross-transport exploitation). We present the design of the first cross-transport attacks on Bluetooth. Our attacks exploit issues that we identified in the specification of CTKD. For example, we find that CTKD enables an adversary to overwrite pairing keys across transports. We leverage these vulnerabilities to impersonate, machine-in-the-middle, and establish unintended sessions with any Bluetooth device supporting CTKD. Since the presented attacks blur the security boundary between BT and BLE, we name them BLUR attacks. We provide a low-cost implementation of the attacks and test it on a broad set of devices. In particular, we successfully attack 16 devices with 14 unique Bluetooth chips from popular vendors (e.g., Cypress, Intel, Qualcomm, CSR, Google, and Samsung), with Bluetooth standard versions of up to 5.2. We discuss why the countermeasures in the Bluetooth are not effective against our attacks, and we develop and evaluate practical and effective alternatives.}

	abstract = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm in wireless communications for meeting the growing connectivity demands in next-generation mobile networks. IRS, also known as software-controlled metasurfaces, consist of an array of adjustable radio wave reflectors, enabling smart radio environments, e.g., for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial diversity of wireless channels. Research on IRS to date has been largely focused on constructive applications. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the IRS provides a practical low-cost toolkit for attackers to easily perform complex signal manipulation attacks on the physical layer in real time. We introduce the environment reconfiguration attack (ERA) as a novel class of jamming attacks in wireless radio networks. Here, an adversary leverages the IRS to rapidly vary the electromagnetic propagation environment to disturb legitimate receivers. The IRS gives the adversary a key advantage over traditional jamming: It no longer has to actively emit jamming signals, instead the IRS reflects existing legitimate signals. In addition, the adversary doesn't need any knowledge about the legitimate channel. We thoroughly investigate the ERA in wireless systems based on the widely employed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. We present insights into the attack through analytical analysis, simulations, as well as experiments. Our results show that the ERA allows to severely degrade the available data rates even with reasonably small IRS sizes. Finally, we implement an attacker setup and demonstrate a practical ERA to slow down an entire Wi-Fi network.}

	abstract = {Wired serial communication (e.g., UART, I2C) is widely used to exchange information between sensors, actuators, and controllers in automation, control, and cyber-physical systems. In this work, it is demonstrated that intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) can be utilized to not only induce spurious serial communications but to also alter legitimate communications, arbitrarily and at a distance, through attacks that cause controlled, bidirectional bit flips. To prove the efficacy of such attacks, two attack signal types, which require differing levels of attacker knowledge and resources to be effective, are proposed and evaluated against UART and I2C serial communication systems. The first attack waveform, which we call simple, is an inexpensive--to--produce narrowband waveform that has high power and tight timing constraints, but requires little attacker knowledge about the targeted system, while the second waveform, which we call complex, leverages a wideband signal that requires less power to achieve the same effect, is more tolerant of timing error in the signal processing phase, but requires a high amount of attacker knowledge of the targeted system. The simple waveform is shown to be over 98.3% effective at inducing a desired bit sequence into randomly transmitted UART frames, which indicates that an attacker could also choose to inject spurious UART frames, at will. On the I2C data streams, the complex waveform is demonstrated to be overall 75% effective in inducing random bits. Countermeasures are discussed and experimentally validated in high-IEMI scenarios.}

We formally prove security in the first case, and insecurity in the latter two as well as making formal recommendations on this. We carry out our formal analysis using the Tamarin-Prover. Lastly, we also present an emulator of the 5GAKE_stack.

	abstract = {The ongoing trend to move industrial appliances from previously isolated networks to the Internet requires fundamental changes in security to uphold secure and safe operation. Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g., Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g., MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices, we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols covering the complete IPv4 address space. Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols (7.2% vs. 0.4%), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5% of hosts). Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42% of hosts with TLS support (26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally, we show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration templates, is promising to strengthen security.}

	abstract = {In the past decade, the vulnerability of aircraft communications against low-resourced attackers has received significant attention both in the information security community and from aviation industry and regulators. Until now, research on attacks against such communications technologies has focused on larger aircraft, neglecting the technologies used in light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). As such lighter aircraft make up a large and growing majority of both airspace users and casualties, this is a glaring oversight from a security and safety perspective. To alleviate this problem, we conduct a first comprehensive security analysis of the FLARM ecosystem, a collision avoidance system focusing on light aircraft and UAV with a large and increasing distribution in many countries. Besides being used in more than 40,000 aircraft, several large providers of air traffic data capture the unauthenticated FLARM data using ground receivers in order to feed crucial downstream applications. To show the vulnerability of this ecosystem, we design, implement and evaluate a practical spoofing attack, which is capable of interacting with FLARM receivers in the air and on the ground. The demonstrated attack uses low-cost hardware and open-source software and is as such accessible to a wide range of threat actors, resulting in a significant potential impact on the safety of all airspace users. Finally, in order to counter such attacks, we propose a first anomaly detection approach based on physical-layer characteristics and validate it with real-world aircraft data.}

	abstract = {Today's industrial networks heavily rely on perimeter-based security. Although this has worked well in the past, the advent of the industrial IoT is blurring the network boundary, and thereby undermining the effectiveness of perimeter-based network defences. To address this, we propose Hopper: an industrial IoT security protocol that places each network host in its own access-controlled nano segment, thus minimizing the attack surface introduced by connecting devices to the network. Because Hopper enforces nano segmentation in-fabric, it does not require modifications to how packets are routed. Hopper achieves this by allowing each network node to verify that each packet it processes is part of a desired flow and was generated by an authorized host. Packets that fail any of these checks are dropped en route. By leveraging prevalent industrial network features, Hopper accomplishes low management and bandwidth overhead while being suitable for a wide range of networks. Our implementation on IoT-class hardware demonstrates that Hopper achieves high throughput and scalability, even in constrained environments.}

	abstract = {Since cameras have become a crucial part in many safety-critical systems and applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance, a large body of academic and non-academic work has shown attacks against their main component --- the image sensor. However, these attacks are limited to coarse-grained and often suspicious injections because light is used as an attack vector. Furthermore, due to the nature of optical attacks, they require the line-of-sight between the adversary and the target camera. In this paper, we present a novel post-transducer signal injection attack against CCD image sensors, as they are used in professional, scientific, and even military settings. We show how electromagnetic emanation can be used to manipulate the image information captured by a CCD image sensor with the granularity down to the brightness of individual pixels. We study the feasibility of our attack and then demonstrate its effects in the scenario of automatic barcode scanning. Our results indicate that the injected distortion can disrupt automated vision-based intelligent systems.}

	abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is composed by a wide variety of software and hardware components that inherently contain vulnerabilities. Previous research has shown that it takes only a few minutes from the moment an IoT device is connected to the Internet to the first infection attempts. Still, we know little about the evolution of exploit vectors: Which vulnerabilities are being targeted in the wild, how has the functionality changed over time, and for how long are vulnerabilities being targeted? Understanding these questions can help in the secure development, and deployment of IoT networks. We present the first longitudinal study of IoT malware exploits by analyzing 17,720 samples collected from three different sources from 2015 to 2020. Leveraging static and dynamic analysis, we extract exploits from these binaries to then analyze them along the following four dimensions: (1) evolution of infection vectors over the years, (2) exploit lifespan, vulnerability age, and the time-to-exploit of vulnerabilities, (3) functionality of exploits, and (4) targeted IoT devices and manufacturers. Our descriptive analysis uncovers several patterns: IoT malware keeps evolving, shifting from simply leveraging brute force attacks to including dozens of device-specific exploits. Once exploits are developed, they are rarely abandoned. The most recent binaries still target (very) old vulnerabilities. In some cases, new exploits are developed for a vulnerability that has been known for years. We find that the mean time-to-exploit after vulnerability disclosure is around 29 months, much longer than for malware targeting other environments.}

	abstract = {Many machine learning adversarial attacks find adversarial samples of a victim model M by following the gradient of some attack objective functions, either explicitly or implicitly. To confuse and detect such attacks, we take the proactive approach that modifies those functions with the goal of misleading the attacks to some local minima, or to some designated regions that can be easily picked up by an analyzer. To achieve this goal, we propose adding a large number of artifacts, which we called attractors, onto the otherwise smooth function. An attractor is a point in the input space, where samples in its neighborhood have gradient pointing toward it. We observe that decoders of watermarking schemes exhibit properties of attractors and give a generic method that injects attractors from a watermark decoder into the victim model M. This principled approach allows us to leverage on known watermarking schemes for scalability and robustness and provides explainability of the outcomes. Experimental studies show that our method has competitive performance. For instance, for un-targeted attacks on CIFAR-10 dataset, we can reduce the overall attack success rate of DeepFool to 1.9%, whereas known defense LID, FS and MagNet can reduce the rate to 90.8%, 98.5% and 78.5% respectively.}

	abstract = {Machine learning models are shown to face a severe threat from Model Extraction Attacks, where a well-trained private model owned by a service provider can be stolen by an attacker pretending as a client. Unfortunately, prior works focus on the models trained over the Euclidean space, e.g., images and texts, while how to extract a GNN model that contains a graph structure and node features is yet to be explored. In this paper, for the first time, we comprehensively investigate and develop model extraction attacks against GNN models. We first systematically formalise the threat modelling in the context of GNN model extraction and classify the adversarial threats into seven categories by considering different background knowledge of the attacker, e.g., attributes and/or neighbour connections of the nodes obtained by the attacker. Then we present detailed methods which utilise the accessible knowledge in each threat to implement the attacks. By evaluating over three real-world datasets, our attacks are shown to extract duplicated models effectively, i.e., 84% - 89% of the inputs in the target domain have the same output predictions as the victim model.}

	abstract = {As the use of machine learning (ML) models is becoming increasingly popular in many real-world applications, there are practical challenges that need to be addressed for model maintenance. One such challenge is to "undo" the effect of a specific subset of dataset used for training a model. This specific subset may contain malicious or adversarial data injected by an attacker, which affects the model performance. Another reason may be the need for a service provider to remove data pertaining to a specific user to respect the user\'s privacy. In both cases, the problem is to "unlearn" a specific subset of the training data from a trained model without incurring the costly procedure of retraining the whole model from scratch. Towards this goal, this paper presents a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based machine unlearning (MCU) algorithm. MCU helps to effectively and efficiently unlearn a trained model from subsets of training dataset. Furthermore, we show that with MCU, we are able to explain the effect of a subset of a training dataset on the model prediction. Thus, MCU is useful for examining subsets of data to identify the adversarial data to be removed. Similarly, MCU can be used to erase the lineage of a user\'s personal data from trained ML models, thus upholding a user\'s "right to be forgotten". We empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed MCU algorithm on real-world phishing and diabetes datasets. Results show that MCU can achieve a desirable performance by efficiently removing the effect of a subset of training dataset and outperform an existing algorithm that utilizes the remaining dataset.}

Thus, the notion of MI relies on both the data feature and the model. The existing MI methods focus on the model only. We introduce a membership feature disentanglement network (MFDN) to approach MI from the perspective of data features. We assume that the data features can be disentangled into the membership features and class features. The membership features are those that enable MI, and class features refer to those that the network is trying to learn. MFDN disentangles these features by adversarial games between the encoders and auxiliary critic networks. It also visualizes the membership features using an inductive bias from the perspective of MI. We perform empirical evaluations to demonstrate that MFDN can disentangle membership features and class features.}

	abstract = {This work presents an approach for compressing hash-based signatures using STARKs (Ben-Sasson et. al.'18). We focus on constructing a hash-based t-of-n threshold signature scheme, as well as an aggregate signature scheme. In both constructions, an aggregator collects individual one-time hash-based signatures and outputs a STARK proof attesting that the signatures are valid and meet the required thresholds. This proof then serves the role of the aggregate or threshold signature. We demonstrate the concrete performance of such constructions, having implemented the algebraic intermediate representations (AIR) for them, along with an experimental evaluation over our implementation of the STARK protocol. We find that, even when we aggregate thousands of signatures, the final aggregated size ranges between 100KB and 200KB. This makes our schemes attractive when there exist at least $50$ one-or-few-times hash-based signatures -- such as in the blockchain setting. We also observe that for STARK-based signature aggregation, the size of individual signatures is less important than the number of hash invocations and the complexity of the signature verification algorithm. This implies that simple hash-based signature variants (e.g. Lamport, HORST, BPQS) are well-suited for aggregation, as their large individual signatures serve only as witnesses to the ZKP circuit and are not needed for aggregate signature verification. Our constructions are directly applicable as scalable solutions for post-quantum secure blockchains which typically employ blocks of hundreds or thousands of signed transactions. Moreover, stateful hash-based one-or-few-times signatures are already used in some PQ-ready blockchains, as address reuse is typically discouraged for privacy reasons.}

	abstract = {Puncturable encryption (PE), introduced by Green and Miers at IEEE S$&$P 2015, allows recipients to update their decryption keys to revoke decryption capability for selected messages without communicating with senders. In general, it allows users to control which ciphertexts their keys may decrypt. The notion of PE has been found very useful in many applications, such as asynchronous messaging systems, group messaging systems, public-key watermarking schemes, secure cloud emails, and many more. In this paper, we introduce a new primitive called hierarchical identity-based puncturable encryption (HIBPE) that enhances the concept of PE by allowing more general key delegation and flexible key puncture. It enhances the capability of the data owner for multi-level encrypted data sharing within a group of users by delegating the decryption keys of the users in higher-levels to generate decryption keys for the users in lower-levels. Moreover, it allows users to puncture (update) their decryption keys on tags so that a decryption key punctured on a tag can no longer decrypt ciphertexts under this tag. In addition, to control access to the users' data, the higher-level users can further puncture the delegated keys (for lower-level users) with some tags such that the part of the owner's data is labeled by the punctured tags will no longer be accessible by the lower-level users. These features offer an efficient and flexible solution for encrypted data sharing as well as data-access control mechanisms in a hierarchical setting. We propose the formal definition and security model for HIBPE schemes and provide a concrete HIBPE scheme based on the hardness of the learning with errors problem in the standard model. Further, we provide a generic construction of forward secure hierarchical identity-based encryption (fs-HIBE) from HIBPE, which enables the first quantum-safe construction of fs-HIBE in the standard model. Moreover, this is the first fs-HIBE construction by exploring the concept of PE. The proposed fs-HIBE provides quantum-safe protection for secret keys from exposure in multi-level encrypted data sharing by evolving the keys with time.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of companies are adopting cloud storage technology to reduce overhead. However, to ensure the privacy of sensitive data, the uploaded data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. The concept of public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) was introduced by Boneh et al. to provide flexible usage of the encrypted data. Unfortunately, most of the PEKS schemes are not secure against inside keyword guessing attacks (IKGA), so the keyword information of the trapdoor may be leaked to the adversary. To solve this issue, Huang and Li presented public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) in which the trapdoor generated by the receiver is only valid for authenticated ciphertexts. With their seminal work, many PAEKS schemes have been introduced for the enhanced security of PAEKS. Some of them further consider the upcoming quantum attacks. However, our cryptanalysis indicated that in fact, these schemes could not withstand IKGA. To fight against the attacks from quantum adversaries and support the privacy-preserving search functionality, we first introduce a novel generic PAEKS construction in this work. Then, we further present the first quantum-resistant PAEKS instantiation based on lattices. The security proofs show that our instantiation not only satisfies the basic requirements but also achieves enhanced security models, namely the multi-ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-trapdoor privacy. Furthermore, the comparative results indicate that with only some additional expenditure, the proposed instantiation provides more secure properties, making it suitable for more diverse application environments.}

	abstract = {Deep learning sits at the forefront of many on-going advances in a variety of learning tasks. Despite its supremacy in accuracy under benign environments, Deep learning suffers from adversarial vulnerability and privacy leakage (e.g., sensitive attribute inference) in adversarial environments. Also, many deep learning systems exhibit discriminatory behaviors against certain groups of subjects (e.g., demographic disparity). In this paper, we propose a unified information-theoretic framework to defend against sensitive attribute inference and mitigate demographic disparity in deep learning for the model partitioning scenario, by minimizing two mutual information terms. We prove that as one mutual information term decreases, an upper bound on the chance for any adversary to infer the sensitive attribute from model representations will decrease. Also, the extent of demographic disparity is bounded by the other mutual information term. Since direct optimization on the mutual information is intractable, we also propose a tractable Gaussian mixture based method and a gumbel-softmax trick based method for estimating the two mutual information terms. Extensive evaluations in a variety of application domains, including computer vision and natural language processing, demonstrate our framework's overall better performance than the existing baselines.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of new and more sophisticated malware targeting the Internet of Things. Moreover, the public release of the source code of popular malware families such as Mirai has spawned diverse variants, making it harder to disambiguate their ownership, lineage, and correct label. Such a rapidly evolving landscape makes it also harder to deploy and generalize effective learning models against retired, updated, and/or new threat campaigns. In this paper, we present EVOLIoT, a novel approach aiming at combating "concept drift" and the limitations of inter-family IoT malware classification by detecting drifting IoT malware families and understanding their diverse evolutionary trajectories. We introduce a robust and effective contrastive method that learns and compares semantically meaningful representations of IoT malware binaries and codes without the need for expensive target labels. We find that the evolution of IoT binaries can be used as an augmentation strategy to learn effective representations to contrast (dis)similar variant pairs. We discuss the impact and findings of our analysis and present several evaluation studies to highlight the tangled relationships of IoT malware, as well as the efficiency of our contrastively learned feature vectors in preserving semantics and reducing out-of-vocabulary size in cross-architecture IoT malware binaries.}

	abstract = {Online data privacy draws more and more concerns. Online Social Network (OSN) service providers employ anonymization mechanisms to preserve private information and data utility. However, these mechanisms mostly focus on the traditional definitions about privacy and utility. Recently, both benign data scientists and attackers utilize machine learning methods to extract information from OSNs. This paper aims to present a novel angle of balancing privacy and utility under machine learning. The proposed scheme perturbs the data that breaks the attackers' learning results and protect the benign third parties' learning results. To preserve both privacy and utility, we propose two different anonymization approaches to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The first approach combines the two objectives. It utilizes the deep learning model, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to sequentially learns the two objectives and generates graphs. The second approach analyzes the differences between the two objects on structures. It utilizes Integrated Gradient (IG) in learning to break attackers' learning results. It structurally rewires edges to preserve third parties' learning results afterwards. The experiment results show that both approaches work well in privacy preservation.}

	abstract = {Working with a high-quality (complete and up-to-date) dataset is the key to building a good machine learning model, especially in security research areas. However, it is not easy to collect a good quality dataset for security research communities because of the sensitive property of most security datasets. We believe that having more contributors to share up-to-date samples would increase the quality of datasets. Therefore, this study aims to increase security dataset sharing for research communities by eliminating possible information leakage. We propose a dataset sharing model and the core algorithm, FeatureTransformer, which guarantees no sensitive information leakage from a shared dataset. FeatureTransformer transforms extracted raw features into intermediate features that conceal sensitive information. Meanwhile, models built from transformed features maintain similar performance compared to models built from the original raw features. We show the effectiveness of our model by evaluating FeatureTransformer with typical malware classification problems using (1) traditional machine learning classifiers and (2) neural network-based classifiers. The experiment results show that the models trained with transformed features merely suffer from 2.56% and 1.48% accuracy degradation on the investigated problems. It indicates that models validated by datasets processed by FeatureTransformer work well with the original raw (untransformed) datasets. We believe that our privacy-preserving model can stimulate dataset sharing and advance the development of machine learning approaches in solving security problems.}

	abstract = {Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the next-generation in-vehicle network, because of its high bandwidth, high throughput, and low cost characteristics. However, no common standard has been established for the security protocol of Automotive Ethernet. While there are a few candidates, including MACsec, IPsec, and TLS, there is no widely favored candidate. Most importantly, existing candidates cannot fully satisfy the requirements of in-vehicle communication, specifically source authentication for broadcast/multicast communication. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis in both security and performance of existing security protocol candidates and identify source authentication and Denial-of-Service (DoS) prevention as two essential but missing properties in these candidates. We propose Gatekeeper, a gateway-based broadcast authentication protocol to ensure source authentication. In general, Gatekeeper introduces an on-path authenticator, which co-locates with the in-vehicle gateway or domain controllers and helps receivers to verify the sender's identity. To defend against DoS threats, we further integrate the time-lock puzzle with Gatekeeper to slow down malicious traffic. Our performance evaluation results show that Gatekeeper only results in 0.03 ms latency overhead for CAN data transmission and outperforms TESLA on both CAN and LiDAR transmission scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of Gatekeeper.}

	abstract = {Continuous location authentication (CLA) seeks to continuously and automatically verify the physical presence of legitimate users in a protected indoor area. CLA can play an important role in contexts where access to electrical or physical resources must be limited to physically present legitimate users. In this paper, we present WearRF-CLA, a novel CLA scheme built upon increasingly popular wrist wearables and UHF RFID systems. WearRF-CLA explores the observation that human daily routines in a protected indoor area comprise a sequence of human-states (e.g., walking and sitting) that follow predictable state transitions. Each legitimate WearRF-CLA user registers his/her RFID tag and also wrist wearable during system enrollment. After the user enters a protected area, WearRF-CLA continuously collects and processes the gyroscope data of the wrist wearable and the phase data of the RFID tag signals to verify three factors to determine the user's physical presence/absence without explicit user involvement: (1) the tag ID as in a traditional RFID authentication system, (2) the validity of the human-state chain, and (3) the continuous coexistence of the paired wrist wearable and RFID tag with the user. The user passes CLA if and only if all three factors can be validated. Extensive user experiments on commodity smartwatches and UHF RFID devices confirm the very high security and low authentication latency of WearRF-CLA.}

	abstract = {Many IoT devices today talk to each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a wireless communication technology often used to exchange data between a paired central and peripheral. These peripheral devices include not only firmware-defined bare-metal peripherals but also mobile application defined peripherals where a mobile app turns a smartphone into a peripheral instead of their usual central role. However, this role reversal increases the attack surface and brings vulnerabilities in bare-metal Bluetooth peripherals to mobile apps where relevant security and privacy have not been well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents PeriScope, an automated tool to unveil the security and privacy vulnerabilities at the link layer of app-defined Bluetooth peripherals in the procedures of broadcasting, pairing, and communication by systematically analyzing their companion mobile apps. PeriScope has analyzed 1,160 Bluetooth peripheral apps from Google Play and identified 69.13% of them that broadcast device or personal identifiable information in cleartext, and, in addition, there are 95% pieces of data managed by these apps (e.g., personal health data and digital keys to unlock doors) to exchange with connected devices can be accessed without authentication. Finally, a set of guidelines for secure app-defined Bluetooth peripherals development is also provided.}

	abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is the de-facto standard in-vehicle network system. Despite its wide adoption by automobile manufacturers, the lack of security design makes it vulnerable to attacks. For instance, broadcasting packets without authentication allows the impersonation of electronic control units (ECUs). Prior mitigations, such as message authentication or intrusion detection systems, fail to address the compatibility requirement with legacy ECUs, stealthy and sporadic malicious messaging, or guaranteed attack detection. We propose a novel authentication system called ShadowAuth that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by offering backwardcompatible packet authentication to ECUs without requiring ECU firmware source code. Specifically, our authentication scheme provides transparent CAN packet authentication without modifying existing CAN packet definitions (e.g., J1939) via automatic ECU firmware instrumentation technique to locate CAN packet transmission code, and instrument authentication code based on the CAN packet behavioral transmission patterns. ShadowAuth enables vehicles to detect state-of-the-art CAN attacks, such as busoff and packet injection, responsively within 60ms without false positives. ShadowAuth provides a sound and deployable solution for real-world ECUs.}

	abstract = {Within the last few years, indirect network-level covert channels have experienced a renaissance with new ideas and evolving concepts. Logical network separation may now be crossed and the sending and receiving activities can be performed with temporal distance between sending and receiving operations. Despite these new developments, all indirect network covert channels share certain basic principles that allow a categorization. So far, the concepts of indirect network-level covert channels have never been systematized. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy containing indirect covert channel patterns that allow a differentiated analysis of all known indirect network-level covert channels. We introduce additional definitions to unify the understanding of the domain and further identify crucial features of indirect covert channels to make them comparable and describable. We further discuss application scenarios as well as potential and already evaluated countermeasures against indirect covert channels. Further, we discuss observable trends and anticipated future developments in the research area of indirect network-level covert channels.}

	abstract = {Software development is a continuous and incremental process. Developers continuously improve their software in small batches rather than in one large batch. The high frequency of small batches makes it essential to use effective testing methods that detect bugs under limited testing time. To this end, researchers propose directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) which aims to generate test cases towards stressing certain target sites. Different from the coverage-based greybox fuzzing (CGF) which aims to maximize code coverage in the whole program, the goal of DGF is to cover potentially buggy code regions (e.g., a recently modified program region). While prior works improve several aspects of DGF (such as power scheduling, input prioritization, and target selection), little attention has been given to improving the seed selection process. Existing DGF tools use seed corpora mainly tailored for CGF (i.e., a set of seeds that cover different regions of the program). We observe that using CGF-based corpora limits the bug-finding capability of a directed greybox fuzzer. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose TargetFuzz, a mechanism that provides a DGF tool with a target-oriented seed corpus. We refer to this corpus as DART corpus, which contains only 'close' seeds to the targets. This way, DART corpus guides DGF to the targets, thereby exposing bugs even under limited fuzzing time. Evaluations on 34 real bugs show that AFLGo (a state-of-the-art directed greybox fuzzer), when equipped with DART corpus, finds 10 additional bugs and achieves $4.03x speedup, on average, in the time-to-exposure compared to a generic CGF-based corpus.}

	abstract = {Many detection and defense mechanisms have been proposed to prevent and mitigate memory errors. A good understanding of the pros and cons of memory defense mechanisms is essential before practical deployment. However, the environment, compilers, and defenses change over time. Thus, a benchmark providing comprehensive evaluations of a range of compilation option choices and defenses is helpful to give developers guidance. The most well-known test suite for evaluating spatial memory errors and exploits is RIPE. However, we show that it is no longer applicable, and a new benchmark is needed. Furthermore, a benchmark should be extensible to evolve over time easily. We propose RecIPE, a new extensible and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating memory error defenses. For extensibility and customisability, RecIPE consists of two components. The TestGen component generates vulnerable code from configurable templates across various vulnerable attributes allowing easy changes through the templates. Measuring the attack and exploitation is with the DefEval component, serving as an attacker at runtime and can be updated with new exploitations. We present a comprehensive evaluation of compiler defenses and sanitizers on RecIPE with gcc and clang, showing the strengths and weaknesses of the various defenses. The results show pros and cons which may not be well known, including gaps between the in-principle guarantee and practical implementation. Our results also point out directions for further improvement in defenses.}

	abstract = {The Resilient File System (ReFS) from Microsoft promises new features such as increased performance and resilience compared to the New Technology File System (NTFS). On the downside, the ReFS drivers are growing more extensive and more complex, increasing the attack surface of the Windows kernel. Attackers can often use security-critical bugs in file system drivers to escalate privileges by mounting a file system. In this work, we present ReFuzz, a structure-aware fuzzer that uses hardware-assisted code coverage to identify bugs in the ReFS driver. The ReFS file system offers several challenges to fuzzing because first, while ReFS is not documented, it exhaustively uses checksums. Second, the minimal size of a ReFS partition is 2GB, notably decreasing the performance of naive fuzzing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our fuzzing approach by finding 27 unique payloads that panic the Windows kernel when mounting or accessing ReFS partitions. Furthermore, we find 162 unique payloads that lead to a system hang-up. Microsoft confirmed those bugs and acknowledged ten unique issues which are security-critical, eight of them allowing remote code execution attacks and got assigned with a CVE number.}

	abstract = {Decompilers are tools designed to recover a high-level language representation (typically in C code) from program binaries. Over the past five years, decompilers have improved enormously, not only in terms of the readability of the produced pseudocode, but also in terms of similarity of the recovered representation to the original source code. Albeit decompilers are routinely used by reverse engineers in different disciplines (e.g., to support vulnerability discovery or malware analysis), they are not yet adopted to produce input for source-code static analysis tools. In particular, source code vulnerability discovery and binary vulnerability discovery remain today two very different areas of research, despite the fact that decompilers could potentially bridge this gap and enable source-code analysis on binary files. In this paper, we conducted a number of experiments on real world vulnerabilities to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. In particular, our measurements are intended to show how the differences between original and decompiled code impact the accuracy of static analysis tools. Remarkably, our results show that in 71% of the cases, the same vulnerabilities can be detected by running the static analyzers on the decompiled code, even though for several cases we observe a steep increment in the number of false positives. To understand the reasons behind these differences, we manually investigated all cases and we identified a number of root causes that affected the ability of static tools to 'understand' the generated code.}

	abstract = {State channel network is the most popular layer-2 solution to the issues of scalability, high transaction fees, and low transaction throughput of public Blockchain networks. However, the existing works have limitations that curb the wide adoption of the technology, such as the expensive creation and closure of channels, strict synchronization between the main chain and off-chain channels, frozen deposits, and inability to execute multi-party smart contracts. In this work, we present Speedster, an account-based state-channel system that aims to address the above issues. To this end, Speedster leverages the latest development of secure hardware to create dispute-free certified channels that can be operated efficiently off the Blockchain. Speedster is peer-to-peer decentralized and provides better privacy protection than prior channel projects. It supports fast native multi-party contract execution, which is previously unavailable in TEE-enabled channel networks. Compared to the Lightning Network, Speedster improves the throughput by about 10,000X and generates 97%$ less on-chain data with a comparable network scale.}

	abstract = {We propose Veksel, a simple generic paradigm for constructing efficient non-interactive coin mixes. The central component in our work is a concretely efficient proof π1-many that a homomorphic commitment c* is a rerandomization of a commitment c ∈ {c1, …,cℓ} without revealing c. We formalize anonymous account-based cryptocurrency as a universally composable functionality and show how to efficiently instantiate it using π1-many in a straightforward way. We instantiate and implement π1-many from Strong-RSA, DDH and random oracles targeting ≈ 112 bits of security. The resulting NIZK has constant size (|π1-many| = 5.3 KB) and constant proving/verification time (≈ 90 ms), on an already accumulated set. Compared to ZCash---which offers comparable marginal verification cost and an anonymity set consisting of every existing transaction---our transactions are larger (6.2 KB) and verification is slower. On the other hand, Veksel relies on better studied assumptions, has no expensive trusted setup for proofs and is arguably simpler to implement. Additionally we think that π1-many might be interesting in other applications, e.g. proving possession of some credential posted on-chain. The efficiency of our concrete NIZK relies on a new Ristretto-friendly elliptic curve, Jabberwock, that is of independent interest: it can be used to efficiently prove statements on "committments on commitments\'\' in Bulletproofs.}

	abstract = {We propose automated methods for synthesising attacks against indifferentiability, a powerful simulation-based notion of security commonly used to reason about symmetric-key constructions. Our methods are inspired from symbolic cryptography which is popular to reason about, e.g., cryptographic protocols. For that, we introduce a core programming language for algebraic distinguishers and study the class of universal distinguishers, who win the indifferentiability game against every simulator; then, we show that the universality of algebraic distinguishers can be reduced to solving systems of algebraic, deducibility and static-equivalence constraints. Our approach is implemented in a tool, AutoDiff, which solves these constraint systems, and applies heuristics to automate the cryptanalysis (i.e., to search automatically for universal distinguishers). We evaluate the tool with many non-trivial attacks from the literature on Feistel networks and Even-Mansour blockciphers among others. Our tool is able to check the validity these attacks, and in many cases to synthesise them without guidance. To our knowledge, AutoDiff is the first practical tool for indifferentiability attacks.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage is becoming increasingly popular among end users that outsource their personal data to services such as Dropbox or Google Drive. For security, uploaded data should ideally be encrypted under a key that is controlled and only known by the user. Current solutions that support user-centric encryption either require the user to manage strong cryptographic keys, or derive keys from weak passwords. While the former has massive usability issues and requires secure storage by the user, the latter approach is more convenient but offers only little security since encrypted data is susceptible to offline attacks. The recent concept of password-authenticated secret-sharing (PASS) enables users to securely derive strong keys from weak passwords by leveraging a distributed server setup, and has been considered a promising step towards secure and usable encryption. However, using PASS for encryption is not as suitable as originally thought: it only considers the (re)construction of a single, static key -- whereas practical encryption will require the management of many, object-specific keys. Using a dedicated PASS instance for every key makes the solution vulnerable against online attacks, inherently leaks access patterns to the servers and poses the risk of permanent data loss when an incorrect password is used at encryption. We therefore propose a new protocol that directly targets the problem of boostrapping encryption from a single password: distributed password-authenticated symmetric encryption DPaSE. DPaSE offers strong security and usability, such as protecting the user's password against online and offline attacks, and ensuring message privacy and ciphertext integrity as long as at least one server is honest. We formally define the desired security properties in the UC framework and propose a provably secure instantiation. The core of our protocol is a new type of Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) that allows to extend a previous partially-blind query with a follow-up request and will be used to blindly carry over passwords across evaluations and avoid online attacks. Our (proof-of-concept) implementation of DPaSE uses 10 exponentiations at the user, 4 exponentiations and 2 pairings at each server, and has a server throughput of 76 account creations and 37 (user authentication followed by) encryptions per second, when run between a user and 2-10 servers.}

	abstract = {Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) is a major area of cryptographic protocol research and practice. Many PAKE proposals have emerged in the 30 years following the original 1992 Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE), some accompanied by new theoretical models to support rigorous analysis. To reduce confusion and encourage practical development, major standards bodies including IEEE, ISO/IEC and the IETF have worked towards standardizing PAKE schemes, with mixed results. Challenges have included contrasts between heuristic protocols and schemes with security proofs, and subtleties in the assumptions of such proofs rendering some schemes unsuitable for practice. Despite initial difficulty identifying suitable use cases, the past decade has seen PAKE adoption in numerous large-scale applications such as Wi-Fi, Apple's iCloud, browser synchronization, e-passports, and the Thread network protocol for Internet of Things devices. Given this backdrop, we consolidate three decades of knowledge on PAKE protocols, integrating theory, practice, standardization and real-world experience. We provide a thorough and systematic review of the field, a summary of the state-of-the-art, a taxonomy to categorize existing protocols, and a comparative analysis of protocol performance using representative schemes from each taxonomy category. We also review real-world applications, summarize lessons learned, and highlight open research problems related to PAKE protocols.}

	abstract = {The security of digital communication relies on few cryptographic protocols that are used to protect internet traffic, from web sessions to instant messaging. These protocols and the cryptographic primitives they rely on have been extensively studied and are considered secure. Yet, sophisticated attackers are often able to bypass rather than break security mechanisms. Kleptography or algorithm substitution attacks (ASA) describe techniques to place backdoors right into cryptographic primitives. While highly relevant as a building block, we show that the real danger of ASAs is their use in cryptographic protocols. In fact, we show that highly desirable security properties of these protocols - forward secrecy and post-compromise security - imply the applicability of ASAs. We then analyze the application of ASAs in three widely used protocols: TLS, WireGuard, and Signal. We show that these protocols can be easily subverted by carefully placing ASAs. Our analysis shows that careful design of ASAs makes detection unlikely while leaking long-term secrets within a few messages in the case of TLS and WireGuard, allowing impersonation attacks. In contrast, Signal's double-ratchet protocol shows higher immunity to ASAs, as the leakage requires much more messages.}

	abstract = {Large-scale quantum computers will be able to efficiently solve the underlying mathematical problems of widely deployed public key cryptosystems in the near future. This threat has sparked increased interest in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and standardization bodies like NIST, IETF, and ETSI are in the process of standardizing PQC schemes as a new generation of cryptography. This raises the question of how to ensure a fast, reliable, and secure transition to upcoming PQC standards in today\'s highly interconnected world. In this work, we propose and investigate a migration strategy towards post-quantum (PQ) authentication for the network protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS). Our strategy is based on the concept of "mixed certificate chains" that use different signature algorithms within the same certificate chain. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our migration strategy, we combine the well-studied and trusted hash-based signature schemes SPHINCS+ and XMSS with elliptic curve cryptography first and subsequently with lattice-based PQC signature schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon). Furthermore, we combine authentication based on mixed certificate chains with the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) CRYSTALS-Kyber as representative for PQC KEMs to evaluate a fully post-quantum and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3 handshake. Our results show that mixed certificate chains containing hash-based signature schemes only at the root certificate authority level lead to feasible connection establishment times despite the increase in communication size. By analyzing code size and peak memory usage of our client and server programs we further demonstrate the suitability of our migration strategy even for embedded devices.}

	abstract = {The classification service over a stream of data is becoming an important offering for cloud providers, but users may encounter obstacles in providing sensitive data due to privacy concerns. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are promising solutions for protecting private data, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks induced by data-dependent access patterns. We propose a Privacy-preserving Data Stream Training and Inference scheme, called EnclaveTree, that provides confidentiality for user's data and the target models against a compromised cloud service provider. We design a matrix-based training and inference procedure to train the Hoeffding Tree (HT) model and perform inference with the trained model inside the trusted area of TEEs, which provably prevent the exploitation of access-pattern-based attacks. The performance evaluation shows that EnclaveTree is practical for processing the data streams with small or medium number of features. When there are less than 63 binary features,EnclaveTree is up to ~10x and ~9 faster than naïve oblivious solution on training and inference, respectively.}

	abstract = {Side-channel attacks that leak sensitive information through a computing device's interaction with its physical environment have proven to be a severe threat to devices' security, particularly when adversaries have unfettered physical access to the device. Traditional approaches for leakage detection measure the physical properties of the device. Hence, they cannot be used during the design process and fail to provide root cause analysis. An alternative approach that is gaining traction is to automate leakage detection by modeling the device. The demand to understand the scope, benefits, and limitations of the proposed tools intensifies with the increase in the number of proposals. In this SoK, we classify approaches to automated leakage detection based on the model's source of truth. We classify the existing tools on two main parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device and the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing the model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge level across the domain and identify open problems. In particular, we highlight the absence of evaluation methodologies and metrics that would compare proposals' effectiveness from across the domain. We believe that our results help practitioners who want to use automated leakage detection and researchers interested in advancing the knowledge and improving automated leakage detection.}

	abstract = {Memory accesses to data stored on an untrusted server are known to leak information, even if the data is encrypted. The oblivious permutation (OP) is a key primitive for algorithms and protocols that are designed to hide these client accesses to the server. An OP algorithm permutes outsourced data blocks according to a given permutation without revealing the permutation to the server. Existing solutions strive to use only O (B) bits of client memory when permuting n blocks each of B bits. State-of-the-art O (B) bit solutions, require an optimal O (n log n) I/Os to complete. However, the hidden constant factor is at least $19600$. In this work, we depart from this memory constraint and, in pursuit of an I/O efficient algorithm, consider the context of cloud storage where a client can have a larger amount of private memory. We propose an algorithm, WaksmanOP, that uses 2n + o(n) + 2B bits of client storage and permutes data in at most 4n log n - 3.6n I/Os. WaksmanOP is based on the Waksman network and involves a novel routing algorithm that carefully configures network switch settings using small client space. We implement WaksmanOP and compare it with existing solutions. Compared to practical methods based on sorting, WaksmanOP reduces the number of I/Os by a log n factor and uses significantly less client space than methods based on shuffling for large values of B. (e.g., 41MB vs. 6.4GB of private memory to permute 16TB of data).}

	abstract = {A web visit typically consists of the browser rendering a dynamically generated response that is specifically tailored to the user. This generation of responses based on the currently authenticated user, whose authentication credentials are automatically included via cookies in all (including cross-site) requests, have led to a multitude of issues. Through cross-site leaks (XS-Leaks), an adversary can try to circumvent the same-origin policy and extract information about responses, which in turn can reveal potentially sensitive information about the user. As research on this class of vulnerabilities only recently gained traction, and the attacks affect many different components of the web platform, the intrinsic characteristics and underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper we present an abstraction of XS-Leaks attacks and introduce an extended formal model that we use to reason about the cause of different leaks and which strategies the various defense mechanisms employ to defend against them. Furthermore, we provide a classification method for current attacks, and, guided by our model, propose a methodology to comprehensively detect new XS-Leak issues, or indicate their absence. Furthermore, we analyze the current defenses and identify gaps that still require further research to provide extensive solutions for sites that rely on cross-site interactions. Finally, we explore how XS-Leak defenses are currently deployed and which challenges website owners are still facing. As a first step towards facilitating the deployment of XS-Leak defenses, we introduce LeakBuster, a dynamic web interface that provides web developers with suggestions based on the insights provided throughout this paper.}

	abstract = {Notwithstanding the predicted demise of signature-based network monitoring, it is still part of the bedrock of security operations. Rulesets are fundamental to the efficacy of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Yet, they have rarely been studied in production environments. We partner with a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) to gain more insight into the evolution of rulesets, the alerts that they trigger and the incidents that get investigated. We analyze a combined ruleset --including both commercial and proprietary rules-- that consists of 130 thousand rules and was used to monitor hundreds of networks. We find that these rulesets keep growing over time but there is almost no overlap among them in terms of detection options or what indicators of compromise they contain. The combined ruleset triggered more than 62 million alerts and led to 150 thousand incident investigations by SOC analysts, though the vast majority of rules never triggered a single alert. We find that just 0.5% of all rules are responsible for more than 80% of the alerts and incidents and only 1.2% of all alerts were deemed to merit closer investigation. Of all incidents, 16% were labeled as false positives and 9% carried significant risk to the client organization. Independently of the type of rule, updating rules is a minor activity. Most rules are never modified and only a fraction is deleted, except for periodic purges in some sets. Seven in-depth interviews with rule developers corroborate the patterns we found in our analysis. Finally, we identify several rule management practices that influence rule and ruleset efficacy, such as supplementing commercial rules with your own and making rules as specific as possible.}

	abstract = {Differential privacy has been accepted as the de facto notion for protecting privacy. Companies and government agencies use differential privacy for privacy-preserving data analysis. For example, the US census bureau applied differential privacy in the 2020 census. One important approach to use a private dataset is to generate a synthetic dataset that is similar to the private dataset in a way that satisfies differential privacy. This enables data analysts to directly apply existing algorithms for performing data analysis. Furthermore, as additional data analysis tasks performed on the published dataset are post-processing, they do not incur additional privacy cost. In recent years, US National Institutes of Standards and Technology ran two competitions on differentially private data synthesis, which drove the development of practically effective data synthesis algorithms. In this talk, I will discuss the current state of the art for private data synthesis, with a focus on those approaches that have performed well in the NIST competitions. One family of approaches uses probabilistic graphical models. My group's approach uses private marginals and a procedure that is similar to Iterative Proportional Fitting, which has been studied in many fields. We also discuss the remaining challenge and open questions.}

	abstract = {Adversaries in cryptography have traditionally been modeled as either semi-honest or malicious. Over the years, however, several works have investigated the design of cryptographic protocols against rational adversaries. The most well-known example are covert adversaries in secure computation (Aumann & Lindell, TCC '07) which are adversaries that wish to deviate from the protocol but without being detected. Protocols secure against such covert adversaries guarantee that deviations are detected with probability at least - which is known as the deterrence factor. In this work, we initiate the study of contracts in cryptographic protocol design. We show how to design, use and analyze contracts between parties for the purpose of incentivizing honest behavior from rational adversaries. We refer to such contracts as adversarial level agreements (ALA). The framework we propose can result in more efficient protocols and can enforce deterrence in covert protocols; meaning that one can guarantee that a given deterrence factor will deter the adversary instead of assuming it. We show how to apply our framework to two-party protocols, including secure two-party computation (2PC) and proofs of storage (PoS). In the 2PC case, we integrate ALAs to publicly-verifiable covert protocols and show, through a game-theoretic analysis, how to set the parameters of the ALA to guarantee honest behavior. We do the same for PoS which are two-party protocols that allow a client to efficiently verify the integrity of a file stored in the cloud.}

	abstract = {Anonymous communication, that is secure end-to-end and unlinkable, plays a critical role in protecting user privacy by preventing service providers from using message metadata to discover communication links between any two users. Techniques, such as Mix-net, DC-net, time delay, cover traffic, Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) and Private Information Retrieval, can be used to achieve anonymous communication. SMC-based approach generally offers stronger simulation based security guarantee. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel SMC approach to establishing anonymous communication, easily implementable with two non-colluding servers which have only communication and storage related capabilities. Our approach offers stronger security guarantee against malicious adversaries without incurring a great deal of extra computation. To show its practicality, we implemented our solutions using Chameleon Cloud to simulate the interactions among a million users, and extensive simulations were conducted to show message latency with various group sizes. Our approach is efficient for smaller group sizes and sub-group communication while preserving message integrity. Also, it does not have the message collision problem.}

	abstract = {Private decision tree evaluation (PDTE) allows a decision tree holder to run a secure protocol with a feature provider. By running the protocol, the feature provider will learn a classification result. Nothing more is revealed to either party. In most existing PDTE protocols, the required communication grows exponentially with the tree's depth d, which is highly inefficient for large trees. This shortcoming motivated us to design a sublinear PDTE protocol with $O(d)$ communication complexity. The core of our construction is a shared oblivious selection (SOS) functionality, allowing two parties to perform a secret-shared oblivious read operation from an array. We provide two SOS protocols, both of which achieve sublinear communication and propose optimizations to further improve their efficiency. Our sublinear PDTE protocol is based on the proposed SOS functionality and we prove its security under a semi-honest adversary. We compare our protocol with the state-of-the-art, in terms of communication and computation, under various network settings. The performance evaluation shows that our protocol is practical and more scalable over large trees than existing solutions.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose memory- and round-efficient protocols for securely evaluating arithmetic primitives. We focus on secure two-party computation over the ring ℤ2k that achieves security against semi-honest adversaries and works in the pre-processing model. Our protocols rely on the unit vectorization technique introduced by Boyle et al. (TCC 2019). The unit vectorization technique provides online-optimal protocols for several fundamental operations in the pre-processing model. However, a relatively large memory cost for correlated randomness is required, which might become an obstacle in a large-scale application. In order to achieve both memory and communication efficiency, we propose a size reduction method that uses unit vectorization only for short-length inputs, and based on this, construct two-round protocols for equality test, detecting the most significant non-zero bit, detecting wrap-around, and less-than comparison. In addition, as applications of these results, we provide practically efficient protocols for integer division, integer square root, integer logarithm, and modular exponentiation.}

	abstract = {The rocketed population, poor security, and 24/7 online properties make Linux-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices ideal targets for attackers. However, due to the budget constraints and an enormous number of vulnerabilities on such devices, protecting them against attacks is very challenging. Therefore, understanding and detecting IoT malware remote infection, which is before the compromised IoT devices are monetized by adversaries, is crucial to mitigate damages and financial loss caused by IoT malware. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a large-scale dataset covering 403,464 samples collected from VirusShare and a large group of IoT honeypots to gain a deep insight into the characteristics of IoT malware remote infection. We share detailed statistics of shell commands found in our dataset, highlight malicious behaviors performed through those commands, investigate current states of fingerprinting methods of those commands, and offer a taxonomy of shell commands by introducing the notion of infection capability. To demonstrate the usefulness of the knowledge gained from our study, we develop an approach to detect ongoing remote infection activities based on infection capabilities. Our evaluation shows that our detection approach can achieve a 99.22% detection rate for remote infections in the wild and introduce small performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Dynamic program analysis is commonly used to vet Android applications. One approach is targeted execution, in which interesting or suspicious code is specifically targeted and analyzed dynamically. However, faithful execution to just the paths that reach these targets can be difficult due to the dependencies they have on other parts of the application. Prior works that handle dependencies must favor either soundness or completeness to the detriment of the other. Techniques that rely on precise dependency tracking ultimately result in lower coverage of targets due to overhead. Meanwhile, other techniques that aim for completeness by ignoring or bypassing dependencies lead to unsound execution and false positives. In this paper, we treat dependencies through the lens of a path context, which represents the program state expected by the path as it is executing. We propose an approach that provides better completeness and low false positives using Context Approximation and Refinement (CAR), which combines static constraint analysis and dynamic error recovery to infer a context based on the desired path flow and refine it during execution. We show that the integration of CAR with targeted execution can reach 3.1x more target locations in popular Android applications than the existing state of the art while having a false detection rate of 9%, enabling more complete analysis and detection of security-sensitive behaviors.}

	abstract = {Real-world software is usually built on top of other software provided as packages that are managed by package managers. Package managers facilitate code reusability and programmer productivity but incur significant software bloat by installing excessive dependent packages. This dependency hell increases potential security issues and hampers rapid response to newly discovered vulnerabilities. We propose a package-oriented debloating framework, PacJam, for adaptive and security-aware management of an application's dependent packages. PacJam improves upon existing debloating techniques by providing a configurable fallback mechanism via post-deployment policies. It also elides the need to completely specify the application's usage scenarios and does not require runtime support. Moreover, PacJam enables to rapidly mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities with minimal impact on the application's functionality. We evaluate PacJam on 10 popular and diverse Linux applications comprising 575K-39M SLOC each. Compared to a state-of-the-art approach, piecewise debloating, PacJam debloats 66% of the packages per application on average, reducing the attack surface by removing 46% of CVEs and 69% (versus 66%) of gadgets, with significantly less runtime overhead and without the need to install a custom loader.}

	abstract = {JavaScript is often rated as the most popular programming language for the development of both client-side and server-side applications, and is currently used in almost all websites. Because of its popularity, JavaScript has become a frequent target for attackers, who exploit vulnerabilities in the source code to take control over the application. To address these JavaScript security issues, such vulnerabilities must be identified first. Existing work mostly deals with package-level vulnerability tracking and measurements. However this approach is limited to detecting usage of already known vulnerabilities. In this paper we develop a vulnerability detection framework that uses vulnerable pattern recognition and textual similarity methods to detect vulnerable functions in real-world projects. We build our framework with the help of a comprehensive dataset of 1,360 verified vulnerable JavaScript functions that we compose based on Snyk vulnerability database and the VulnCode-DB project. Using our framework, we identify 11,148 vulnerable functions in three environments: NPM packages, Chrome web extensions and popular websites. In addition,we conduct an in-depth contextual analysis of the findings in several popular/critical projects and confirm the security exposure of 15 cases. As evident from the results, our approach can shift JavaScript vulnerability detection from the coarse package/library level to function level, and thus improve accuracy of detection and aid timely patching.}

	abstract = {In order to protect user privacy in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), a series of ingeniously designed privacy-preserving frameworks have been proposed. The state-of-the-art approaches adopt Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for linear function and Garbled Circuits (GC)/Oblivious Transfer (OT) for nonlinear operation to improve computation efficiency. Despite the encouraging progress, the computation cost is still too high for practical applications. This work represents the first step to effectively prune privacy-preserving deep learning models to reduce computation complexity. Although model pruning has been discussed extensively in the machine learning community, directly applying the plaintext model pruning schemes offers little help to reduce the computation in privacy-preserving models. In this paper we propose Hunter, a structured pruning method that identifies three novel HE-friendly structures, i.e., internal structure, external structure, and weight diagonal to guide the pruning process. Hunter outputs a pruned model that, without any loss in model accuracy, achieves a significant reduction in HE operations (and thus the overall computation cost) in the privacy-preserving MLaaS. We apply Hunter in various deep learning models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG and ResNet over classic datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The experimental results demonstrate that, without accuracy loss, Hunter efficiently prunes the original networks to reduce the HE Perm, Mult, and Add operations. For example, in the state-of-the-art VGG-16 on ImageNet with 10 chosen classes, the total number of Perm is reduced to as low as 2% of the original network, and at the same time, Mult and Add are reduced to only 14%, enabling a significantly more computation-efficient privacy-preserving MLaaS.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been shown vulnerable to a new class of adversarial attacks, known as model poisoning attacks (MPA), where one or more malicious clients try to poison the global model by sending carefully crafted local model updates to the central parameter server. Existing defenses that have been fixated on analyzing model parameters show limited effectiveness in detecting such carefully crafted poisonous models. In this work, we propose FLARE, a robust model aggregation mechanism for FL, which is resilient against state-of-the-art MPAs. Instead of solely depending on model parameters, FLARE leverages the penultimate layer representations (PLRs) of the model for characterizing the adversarial influence on each local model update. PLRs demonstrate a better capability to differentiate malicious models from benign ones than model parameter-based solutions. We further propose a trust evaluation method that estimates a trust score for each model update based on pairwise PLR discrepancies among all model updates. Under the assumption that honest clients make up the majority, FLARE assigns a trust score to each model update in a way that those far from the benign cluster are assigned low scores. FLARE then aggregates the model updates weighted by their trust scores and finally updates the global model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE in defending FL against various MPAs, including semantic backdoor attacks, trojan backdoor attacks, and untargeted attacks, and safeguarding the accuracy of FL.}

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms, when applied to sensitive data, can pose severe threats to privacy. A growing body of prior work has demonstrated that membership inference attack (MIA) can disclose whether specific private data samples are present in the training data to an attacker. However, most existing studies on MIA focus on aggregated privacy leakage for an entire population, while leaving privacy leakage across different demographic subgroups (e.g., females and males) in the population largely unexplored. This raises two important issues: (1) privacy unfairness (i.e., if some subgroups are more vulnerable to MIAs than the others); and (2) defense unfairness (i.e., if the defense mechanisms provide more protection to some particular subgroups than the others). In this paper, we investigate both privacy unfairness and defense fairness.We formalize a new notation of privacy-leakage disparity (PLD), which quantifies the disparate privacy leakage of machine learning models to MIA across different subgroups. In terms of privacy unfairness, our empirical analysis of PLD on real-world datasets shows that privacy unfairness exists. The minority subgroups (i.e., the less represented subgroups) tend to have higher privacy leakage. We analyze how subgroup size and subgroup data distribution impact PLD through the lens of model memorization. In terms of defense unfairness, our empirical evaluation shows the existence of unfairness of three state-of-the-art defenses, namely differential privacy, L2-regularizer, and Dropout, against MIA. However, defense unfairness mitigates privacy unfairness as the minority subgroups receive stronger protection than the others. We analyze how the three defense mechanisms affect subgroup data distribution disparately and thus leads to defense unfairness.}

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are often vulnerable to semantics-preserving adversarial attacks. That is, they make different semantic predictions on input instances with similar content and semantics. However, it remains unclear to which extent modern NLP models are vulnerable to content-preserving and semantics-flipping (CPSF) adversarial attacks. That is, they would make the same semantic prediction on input instances with similar content but flipped semantics. Attackers can use either semantics-preserving or CPSF adversarial examples to create misunderstanding between humans and models, and incur severe consequences in real-world applications. However, this equally important problem on CPSF adversarial examples has not been studied by researchers yet. In this paper, we perform the first study to investigate CPSF adversarial examples and propose CPSF adversarial attacks to reveal this new type of vulnerability of NLP models. We develop a two-stage approach to generate CPSF adversarial examples. Our experiments on two types of NLP tasks, sentiment analysis and textual entailment, demonstrate that CPSF adversarial examples can successfully fool victim models while preserving the same content with flipped semantics to humans. We further validate the good transferability of CPSF adversarial examples on NLP services of Microsoft and Google. Moreover, we demonstrate that adversarial training can to a meaningful extent mitigate CPSF adversarial attacks. Overall, our work implies that researchers need to improve NLP models' robustness against CPSF adversarial attacks that uniquely exploit the blind spots where NLP models are too insensitive to even big changes in semantics.}

	abstract = {Modern commercial antivirus systems increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) to keep up with the rampant inflation of new malware. However, it is well-known that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Previous works have shown that ML malware classifiers are fragile to the white-box adversarial attacks. However, ML models used in commercial antivirus (AV) products are usually not available to attackers and only return hard classification labels. Therefore, it is more practical to evaluate the robustness of ML models and real-world AVs in a pure black-box manner. We propose a black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework to generate AEs for PE malware classifiers and AV engines. It regards the adversarial attack problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, which finds an optimal balance between exploiting the successful patterns and exploring more varieties. Compared to other frameworks, our improvements lie in three points: 1) limiting the exploration space by modeling the generation process as a stateless process to avoid combination explosions, 2) reusing the successful payload in modeling; and 3) minimizing the changes on AE samples to correctly assign the rewards in RL learning (which also helps identify the root cause of evasions). As a result, our framework has much higher evasion rates than other off-the-shelf frameworks. Results show it has over 74%--97% evasion rate for two state-of-the-art ML detectors and over 32%--48% evasion rate for commercial AVs in a pure black-box setting. We also demonstrate that the transferability of adversarial attacks among ML-based classifiers is higher than that between ML-based classifiers and commercial AVs.}

	abstract = {Biometric databases collect people's information and allow users to perform proximity searches (finding all records within a bounded distance of the query point) with few cryptographic protections. This work studies proximity searchable encryption applied to the iris biometric. Prior work proposed inner product functional encryption as a technique to build proximity biometric databases (Kim et al., SCN 2018). This is because binary Hamming distance is computable using an inner product. This work identifies and closes two gaps to using inner product encryption for biometric search: Biometrics naturally use long vectors often with thousands of bits. Many inner product encryption schemes generate a random matrix whose dimension scales with vector size and have to invert this matrix. As a result, setup is not feasible on commodity hardware unless we reduce the dimension of the vectors. We explore state of the art techniques to reduce the dimension of the iris biometric and show that all known techniques harm the accuracy of the resulting system. That is, for small vector sizes multiple unrelated biometrics are returned in the search. For length 64 vectors, at a 90% probability of the searched biometric being returned, 10% of stored records are erroneously returned on average. Rather than changing the feature extractor, we introduce a new cryptographic technique that allows one to generate several smaller matrices. For vectors of length 1024 this reduces time to run setup from 23 days to 4 minutes. At this vector length, for the same $90%$ probability of the searched biometric being returned, .02% of stored records are erroneously returned on average. Prior inner product approaches leak distance between the query and all stored records. We refer to these as distance-revealing. We show a natural construction from function hiding, secret-key, predicate, inner product encryption (Shen, Shi, and Waters, TCC 2009). Our construction only leaks access patterns, and which returned records are the same distance from the query. We refer to this scheme as distance-hiding. We implement and benchmark one distance-revealing and one distance-hiding scheme. The distance-revealing scheme can search a small (hundreds) database in 4 minutes while the distance-hiding scheme is not yet practical, requiring 3.5 hours.}

	abstract = {Voice-activated systems are integrated into a variety of desktop, mobile, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation and replay attacks, in which malicious attackers synthesize the voice of a victim or simply replay it, have brought growing security concerns. Existing speaker verification techniques distinguish individual speakers via the spectrographic features extracted from an audible frequency range of voice commands. However, they often have high error rates and/or long delays. In this paper, we explore a new direction of human voice research by scrutinizing the unique characteristics of human speech at the ultrasound frequency band. Our research indicates that the high-frequency ultrasound components (e.g. speech fricatives) from 20 to 48 kHz can significantly enhance the security and accuracy of speaker verification. We propose a speaker verification system, SUPERVOICE that uses a two-stream DNN architecture with a feature fusion mechanism to generate distinctive speaker models. To test the system, we create a speech dataset with 12 hours of audio (8,950 voice samples) from 127 participants. In addition, we create a second spoofed voice dataset to evaluate its security. In order to balance between controlled recordings and real-world applications, the audio recordings are collected from two quiet rooms by 8 different recording devices, including 7 smartphones and an ultrasound microphone. Our evaluation shows that SUPERVOICE achieves 0.58% equal error rate in the speaker verification task, which reduces the best equal error rate of the existing systems by 86.1%. SUPERVOICE only takes 120 ms for testing an incoming utterance, outperforming all existing speaker verification systems. Moreover, within 91 ms processing time, SUPERVOICE achieves 0% equal error rate in detecting replay attacks launched by 5 different loudspeakers. Finally, we demonstrate that SUPERVOICE can be used in retail smartphones by integrating an off-the-shelf ultrasound microphone.}

	abstract = {Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate common pitfalls affecting the evaluation of authentication systems based on touch dynamics. We consider different factors that lead to misrepresented performance, are incompatible with stated system and threat models or impede reproducibility and comparability with previous work. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (i) small sample sizes (both number of users and recording sessions), (ii) using different phone models in training data, (iii) selecting non-contiguous training data, (iv) inserting attacker samples in training data and (v) swipe aggregation. We perform a systematic review of 30 touch dynamics papers showing that all of them overlook at least one of these pitfalls. To quantify each pitfall's effect, we design a set of experiments and collect a new longitudinal dataset of touch dynamics from 470 users over 31 days comprised of 1,166,092 unique swipes. We make this dataset and our code available online. Our results show significant percentage-point changes in reported mean EER for several pitfalls: including attacker data (2.55%), non-contiguous training data (3.8%), phone model mixing (3.2%-5.8%). We show that, in a common evaluation setting, cumulative effects of these evaluation choices result in a combined difference of 8.9% EER. We also largely observe these effects across the entire ROC curve. Furthermore, we validate the pitfalls on four distinct classifiers - SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN. Based on these insights, we propose a set of best practices that, if followed, will lead to more realistic and comparable reporting of results in the field.}

	abstract = {We present ALEXA VERSUS ALEXA (AvA), a novel attack that leverages audio files containing voice commands and audio reproduction methods in an offensive fashion, to gain control of Amazon Echo devices for a prolonged amount of time. AvA leverages the fact that Alexa running on an Echo device correctly interprets voice commands originated from audio files even when they are played by the device itself -- i.e., it leverages a command self-issue vulnerability. Hence, AvA removes the necessity of having a rogue speaker in proximity of the victim's Echo, a constraint that many attacks share. With AvA, an attacker can self-issue any permissible command to Echo, controlling it on behalf of the legitimate user. We have verified that, via AvA, attackers can control smart appliances within the household, buy unwanted items, tamper linked calendars and eavesdrop on the user. We also discovered two additional Echo vulnerabilities, which we call Full Volume and Break Tag Chain. The Full Volume increases the self-issue command recognition rate, by doubling it on average, hence allowing attackers to perform additional self-issue commands. Break Tag Chain increases the time a skill can run without user interaction, from eight seconds to more than one hour, hence enabling attackers to setup realistic social engineering scenarios. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, the adversary can self-issue commands that are correctly executed 99% of the times and can keep control of the device for a prolonged amount of time. We reported these vulnerabilities to Amazon via their vulnerability research program, who rated them with a Medium severity score. In addition, we discuss the results of a set of tests performed on three voluntary Echo-equipped households to verify the feasibility of AvA in real scenarios, finding that the attack remains undetected and operative in most cases. Finally, to assess limitations of AvA on a larger scale, we provide the results of a survey performed on a study group of 18 users, and we show that most of the limitations against AvA are hardly used in practice.}

	abstract = {Private set intersection (PSI) is a secure two-party computation ($2$PC) protocol that reveals only the intersection of two private sets. Driven by different applications, various works devise specific protocols for private computation on the intersection (PCI), e.g., summation of the values labeled with each element in the intersection. Upgrading a PSI protocol to PCI for generic computations while maintaining efficiency and preventing leakage is known to be not straightforward (e.g., the intersection set size could be leaked). Ciampi and Orlandi (SCN\'18) proposed a generic, one-of-a-kind, and concretely efficient PSI design that is compatible with common 2PC paradigms for realizing PCI, namely, garbled circuits, secret sharing, and homomorphic encryption. Its core is a 2PC protocol for private set membership, ƒ(x, (Y, ({γ0, γ1})) = (γ(x ∈ Y), ⊥), which uses only symmetric-key operations and oblivious transfer. This paper continues their endeavor, which "compresses" the graph representation of set Y to reduce the computation and communication costs (e.g., 40%/58% for the latter, when |Y| = 220 /224 with the security parameter λ = 128). Our protocol is inspired by a recent (outsourceable) 2PC protocol for decision tree evaluation by Ma et al. (NDSS\'21). We overcome the challenges of supporting the branching program needed by Ciampi and Orlandi by extending a protocol for a tree, e.g., allowing a node to have multiple "real" and "fake" parents while hiding the "spine" of the branching program without padding the maximum possible number of fake ciphertexts. As a bonus, we extend our PCI protocol to the secure outsourcing setting. Such PCI protocols are scarcer. We also briefly discuss a PCI application in contact tracing for fine-grained privacy control.}

	abstract = {Private set intersection (PSI) protocols allow a set of mutually distrustful parties, each holding a private set of items, to compute the intersection over all their sets, such that no other information is revealed. PSI has a wide variety of applications including online advertising (e.g., efficacy computation), security (e.g., botnet detection, intrusion detection), proximity testing (e.g., COVID-19 contact tracing), and more. Private set intersection is a rapidly developing area and there exist many highly efficient protocols. However, almost all of these protocols are for the case of two parties or for semi-honest security. In particular, despite the high interest in this problem, prior to our work there has been no concretely efficient, maliciously secure multiparty PSI protocol. We present PSImple, the first concretely efficient maliciously-secure multiparty PSI protocol. Our construction is based on oblivious transfer and garbled Bloom filters, and has a round-optimal online phase. To demonstrate the practicality of PSImple, we implemented it and ran experiments with up to 32 parties and 2 20 inputs. We show that PSImple is competitive even with the state-of-the-art concretely efficient semi-honest multiparty PSI protocols. Additionally, we revisit the garbled Bloom filter parameters used in the 2-party PSI protocol of Rindal and Rosulek (Eurocrypt 2017). Using a more careful analysis, we show that the size of the garbled Bloom filters and the number of oblivious transfers required for malicious security can be significantly reduced, often by more than 20%. These improved parameters also imply a better security guarantee, and can be used both in the 2-party PSI protocol of Rindal and Rosulek and in i>PSImple.}

	abstract = {Condorcet voting, first proposed by Marquis de Condorcet in the 18th century, chooses a winner of an election as one that defeats every other candidate by a simple majority. According to Condorcet's criterion, a Condorcet winner is the socially optimal choice in a multi-candidate election. However, despite the crucial importance of this voting system in social-choice theory, it has not been widely used in practical applications. This is partly due to the complex tallying procedure, and also the fact that several candidates may form a tie. Existing systems that provide online Condorcet voting services in the real world try to speed up the tallying process by collecting and tallying Condorcet ballots in a digital form. However, they require voters to completely trust the server. In this paper, we propose VERICONDO, the first end-to-end verifiable Condorcet e-voting system without any tallying authorities. Our system allows a voter to fully verify the tallying integrity without involving any trustworthy tallying authorities and provides strong protection of the ballot secrecy. One main challenge in our work lies in proving the well-formedness of an encrypted ballot while being able to tally the ballots in a publicly verifiable yet privacy-preserving manner. We overcome this challenge by adopting a pairwise comparison matrix and applying a novel vector-sum technique to achieve exceptional efficiency. The overall computational cost per ballot is O (n2) where n is the number of candidates. This is probably the best that one may hope for given the use of a n x n matrix to record a Condorcet ballot. In case of a tie, we show how to apply known Condorcet methods to break the tie in a publicly verifiable manner. Finally, we present a prototype implementation and benchmark performance to show the feasibility of our system.}

	abstract = {EPID systems are anonymous authentication mechanisms which are standardized by ISO/IEC and massively deployed in Intel processors. They are related to the large family of privacy-preserving signatures but differ in that they provide a very pragmatic way of revoking members. Concretely, a member ℘ can be revoked by simply placing one of its signatures in a so-called signature revocation list SRL. Once this is done, every signer will have to include in its future signatures a proof that it has not generated any element of SRL, which implicitly revokes ℘. This proof of non-revocation generated by each signer is thus the core component of EPID systems and largely dominates the overall complexity. Yet, it appears that it has been a secondary concern for existing constructions that usually implement it using some costly modular zero-knowledge proofs. In this paper, we reconsider this problem by proposing a new EPID system with a much more efficient proof of non-revocation. The latter is no longer zero-knowledge but its combination with the other components of the EPID system still results in an anonymous signature. Proving the latter point is actually quite complex and requires to tweak these other components but in the end it leads to EPID signatures that are up to three times smaller than previous ones and that can be generated and verified with two times less computations.}

	abstract = {The npm software ecosystem allows developers to easily import code written by others. However, manual vetting of every individual installed component is made difficult in many cases by the number of transitive dependencies brought in by installing popular packages. This has enabled attackers to propagate malicious code by hiding it deep into the dependency chains of popular packages. A particularly dangerous form of attack comes from malicious code embedded into package install scripts. We tackle the problem of preventing undesirable install-time behavior by proposing Latch, a system for mediating install-time capabilities of npm packages. Latch generates permission manifests summarizing each package's install-time behavior and checks them against user-defined policies to ensure compliance. Policies in Latch are expressed in a rich formal policy language that covers a broad range of use cases. Our key insight is that expressive Latch policies empower users to define and enforce their own individualized security needs. Evaluation of practical Latch policies on all publicly available npm packages and on a number of real-world attack packages demonstrates that our approach is effective in identifying and stopping unwanted behavior while minimizing disruption due to undesired alerts.}

	abstract = {Several totalitarian states around the world deploy sophisticated censorship apparatuses to prevent citizens from freely accessing the Internet. To counter these restrictions, some censorship-circumven-tion tools establish covert channels through the media streams of popular conferencing applications. A recent tool named Protozoa allows for establishing high-performing, peer-to-peer covert channels over WebRTC media streams. However, Protozoa is vulnerable to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. This may occur in cases where WebRTC applications rely on WebRTC gateways to mediate users' connections. In such cases, an adversary that controls the WebRTC gateway can inspect the content of the media streams and trivially detect the transmission of covert payload. This work proposes Stegozoa, a new censorship-circumvention tool that aims to foil the ability of adversaries in control of WebRTC gateways to detect covert data transmissions. Specifically, Stegozoa steganographically embeds covert data into the WebRTC video signal, preventing the detection of the covert payload through direct video content inspection. To this end, Stegozoa leverages state-of-the-art steganography techniques, applying them deep within WebRTC's video coding pipeline and fine-tuning them to efficiently use the available covert channel capacity while ensuring undetectability. We have fully implemented Stegozoa based on an instrumented Chromium codebase. Our evaluation reveals that Stegozoa can create secure WebRTC covert channels that are highly resistant to steganalysis and traffic analysis attacks. Despite the expected reduction in performance that was traded for stronger security, Stegozoa can deliver a reasonable throughput, allowing its users to run low-bandwidth message exchanging tasks.}

	abstract = {As websites grow ever more dynamic and load more of their content on the fly, automatically interacting with them via simple tools like curl is getting less of an option. Instead, headless browsers with JavaScript support, such as PhantomJS and Puppeteer, have gained traction on the Web over the last few years. For various use cases like messengers and social networks that display link previews, these browsers visit arbitrary, user-controlled URLs. To avoid compromise through known vulnerabilities, these browsers need to be diligently kept up-to-date. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of what we coin server-side browsers at scale and find that many websites are running severely outdated browsers on the server-side. Remarkably, the majority of them had not been updated for more than 6 months and over 60% of the discovered implementations were found to be vulnerable to publicly available proof-of-concept exploits.}

	abstract = {Microarchitectural side-channel attacks can derive secrets from the execution of vulnerable programs. Their implementation in web browsers represents a considerable extension of their attack surface, as a user simply browsing a malicious website, or even a malicious third-party advertisement in a benign cross-origin isolated website, can be a victim. In this paper, we present the first port contention side channel running entirely in a web browser, despite a highly challenging environment. Our attack can be used to build a cross-browser covert channel with a bit rate of 200bps, one order of magnitude above the state of the art, and has a spatial resolution of 1024 native instructions in a side-channel attack, a performance on-par with Prime+Probe attacks. We provide a framework to evaluate the port contention caused by WebAssembly instructions on Intel processors, allowing to increase the portability of port contention side channels. We conclude from our work that port contention attacks are not only fast, they are also less susceptible to noise than cache attacks, and are immune to countermeasures implemented in browsers as well as most side channel countermeasures, which target the cache in their vast majority.}

The potential of videos to persuade users by engaging them with the experience of the content creator makes them an attractive medium for promoting various kinds of products and services, including apps and websites. The Youtubers promoting these products online may not necessarily be aware of the harms to which they might expose potential users. In fact, they may neither have the incentive nor the technical expertise to look into potential harms. In this work, we uncover one such ecosystem, where the Youtubers are primarily driven by earning money from their channels, but in doing so expose their audience to fraudulent apps. We collect and analyze a dataset of YouTube videos promoting money making apps. Such videos convince users (primarily in developing regions) that they can make money by downloading and installing the mobile apps being promoted, and performing simple tasks such as watching videos, installing other apps, or playing games. We study the popularity of these videos and apps, as well as illuminate the types of tasks they promote, and whether these apps are potentially malicious.}

	abstract = {Deep Learning is rapidly evolving to the point that it can be used in crucial safety and security applications, including self-driving vehicles, surveillance, drones, and robots. However, these deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks based on adversarial samples that are undetectable to the human eye but cause the model to misbehave. There is an increasing demand for comprehensive and in-depth analysis of behaviors of various attacks and the possible defenses against common deep learning models under several adversarial scenarios. In this study, we conducted four separate investigations. First, we examine the relationship between the model's complexity and its robustness against the studied attacks. Second, the connection between the performance and diversity of models is examined. Third, the first and second experiments were tested across different datasets to explore the impact of the dataset on the performance of the model. Four, throughout the defense strategies, the model behavior is extensively investigated. The code, trained models, and detailed settings and results are available at: https://github.com/InfoLab-SKKU/ML-Adversarial-Attacks-Analysis}

The bulletin board is open to the public, which means that anyone can view its contents. The fundamental security criteria for a BB are that its contents cannot be deleted, and that no evidence of publication can be falsified. BB was commonly perceived as a trusted and publicly verifiable channel. It formed the backbone of many important protocols such as e-voting, secure multi-party computation etc. and quite often it was assumed to exist to support the execution of the main protocol. After the advent of blockchain technology, BB systems has found a strong footing regarding its implementation in a distributed manner. In this paper, we aim to provide a concise summary of the evolution of bulletin board, its implementation issues and security analysis with an emphasis on its impact to e-voting systems.}

Providing explanations for DNN models offers a sense of security by human involvement, which reveals whether the sample is benign or adversarial even though previous studies achieved a high attack success rate. However, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) are shown to be susceptible to adversarial manipulations in white-box settings. Attacking IDLSes in black-box settings is challenging and remains an open research domain. In this work, we propose a black-box version of the white-box AdvEdge approach against IDLSes, which is query-efficient and gradient-free without obtaining any knowledge of the target DNN model and its coupled interpreter. Our approach takes advantage of transfer-based and score-based techniques using the effective microbial genetic algorithm (MGA). We achieve a high attack success rate with a small number of queries and high similarity in interpretations between adversarial and benign samples.}

	abstract = {Base64 encoding has been a popular method to encode binary data into printable ASCII characters. It is commonly used in several serialization protocols, web, and logging applications, while it is oftentimes the preferred method for human-readable database fields. However, while convenient and with a better compression rate than hex-encoding, the large number of base64 variants in relted standards and proposed padding-mode optionality have been proven problematic in terms of security and cross-platform compatibility. This paper addresses a potential attack vector in the base64 decoding phase, where multiple different encodings can successfully decode into the same data, effectively breaking string uniqueness guarantees. The latter might result to log mismatches, denial of service attacks and duplicated database entries, among the others. Apart from documenting why canonicity can be broken by a malleable encoder, we also present an unexpected result, where most of today's base64 decoder libraries are not 100% compatible in their default settings. Some surprising results include the non-compatible behavior of major Rust base64 crates and between popular Javascript and NodeJS base64 implementations. Finally, we propose ways and test vectors for mitigating these issues until a more permanent solution is widely adopted.}

However, the multitude of recent incidents that were caused by or somehow involved such systems, often with dire consequences, makes it obvious that IoT system trustworthiness is not yet attained. In this paper we provide an overview on IoT trustworthiness, and introduce a trustworthiness assurance methodology based on the novel concept of Trustworthiness Assurance Levels (TALs). The methodology is intended for analyzing IoT systems to determine the degree of confidence one can have that they will perform as expected for a given deployment, taking into consideration external disturbances, system errors, faults and attacks. The paper also includes a case study discussion to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.}

	abstract = {A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by an attacker, e.g., performing unauthorized actions within a computer system. For example, privilege escalation is a type of vulnerability in software, which can be used to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. However, most applications contain vulnerabilities, some are fixed over time by patches, but many are discovered only after exploitation, which results in steep costs. Furthermore, program analysis tools are generally quite difficult to use. Security analysts still do manual investigation on software, i.e., using static analysis tools on machine code or source code to find bugs. Multimodal learning has been widely used in image processing, but is rarely seen in software security. We introduce a new dataset for multimodal deep learning, MVDSC-C (Multisource for Vulnerability Detection in Source Code - C/C++). Our preliminary results show that combined modalities perform better than single modalities.}

	abstract = {There are several security tools available to tackle cyber threats, but the sophistication of attacks leads to the failure of defense mechanisms. Among such tools, endpoint security agents are much prominent to safeguard organizations from potential threats. To monitor and investigate systems for unpredictable modifications and proof of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used by malware writers. In this work, we develop a real-time system behavior monitoring solution. We use three modules - monitoring, analysis, and mapping to counter the threats based on attack patterns. All three modules have their unique mechanism and are interconnected. The monitoring agent is developed for the Windows platform using the C++ programming language, which captures Windows kernel-level system events in a multi-threaded form. It captures critical information such as - network activity, registry, file, accessed paths, processes, etc. The monitoring agent ships the collected events to the analysis module. In the analysis module, we perform analysis in three phases: rule-based, machine learning (ML)-based, and risk-assessment. Rule-based mechanism finds the Indicator of Compromises (IoCs) from the system events related to exploits, web shell, malicious documents, etc. The ML-based analysis gives an overall understanding of normal vs. suspicious behavior. The risk-assessment analysis uses rule-based and ML-based analysis outputs, to provide the risk-score based on the number of IoCs detected and the suspicious behavior predicted. In the mapping phase, we offer an interactive dashboard to the end-user for visualizing all the activities and the analysis outcomes like running processes, suspicious processes, network activities, port accessed, suspicious paths accessed by a single process, etc., using Kibana. The designed tool monitors the system events in near real-time and reports any suspicious activity that helps in mitigating the threats posed to the user. Hence, it acts as a comprehensive security solution with multi-dimensional capabilities.}

A person can show their personality through how many photos they post, what kinds of photos they post, and what kind of language they tend to use. This research investigates the correlation between a person's personality type and the photos and tweets which that person posts. Social media information and personality types were collected from two different platforms, SONA (college-age students) and MTurk (crowdsourcing platform). The same survey was given to both platforms. Participants answered questions pertaining to their personality, and based on these answers were assigned a True Color and scores for Big Five. Our results show that people who identified with the green True Color self schema tended to share more photos than the other True Color categories. Additionally, our results show that people with Open personality types tend to post more photos than other Big Five personality types, and those photos tend to have more people in them than other personality types.}

	abstract = {Cyber-phishing attacks recently became more precise, targeted, and tailored by training data to activate only in the presence of specific information or cues. They are adaptable to a much greater extent than traditional phishing detection. Hence, automated detection systems cannot always be 100% accurate, increasing the uncertainty around expected behavior when faced with a potential phishing email. On the other hand, human-centric defence approaches focus extensively on user training but face the difficulty of keeping users up to date with continuously emerging patterns. Therefore, advances in analyzing the content of an email in novel ways along with summarizing the most pertinent content to the recipients of emails is a prospective gateway to furthering how to combat these threats. Addressing this gap, this work leverages transformer-based machine learning to (i) analyze prospective psychological triggers, to (ii) detect possible malicious intent, and to (iii) create representative summaries of emails. We then amalgamate this information and present it to the user to allow them to (i) easily decide whether the email is "phishy" and (ii) self-learn advanced malicious patterns.}

	abstract = {The rapid pace of malware development and the widespread use of code obfuscation, polymorphism, and morphing techniques pose a considerable challenge to detecting and analyzing malware. Today, it is difficult for antivirus applications to use traditional signature-based detection methods to detect morphing malware. Thus, the emergence of structure graph-based detection methods has become a hope to solve this challenge. In this work, we propose a method for detecting malware using graphs' spectral heat and wave signatures, which are efficient and size- and permutation-invariant. We extracted 250 and 1,000 heat and wave representations, and we trained and tested heat and wave representations on eight machine learning classifiers. We used a dataset of 37,537 unpacked Windows malware executables and extracted the control flow graph (CFG) of each windows malware to obtain the spectral representations. Our experimental results showed that by using heat and wave spectral graph theory, the best malware analysis accuracy reached 95.9%.}

	abstract = {Secure computation methods include methods that use homomorphic encryption (HE) and those that use secret sharing (SS). Secure computation based on HE can be realized using one server, and the computation process can be made public if the encryption key is kept secure. However, HE generally requires a substantial computation cost. In contrast, SS has the advantage of low computation cost, allowing for high-speed processing; however, all servers must be managed independently. And the process of k or more servers cannot be disclosed. In particular, secret input will be leaked when the same organization manages multiple servers to implement SS. Therefore, a complex model where each server is independently managed is required. Iwamura et al. proposed a secure computation that is information-theoretic secure in n≥k instead of n≥2k−1 by assuming a trusted third party (TTP). In this paper, by making more effective use of a TTP, we demonstrate that secure computation based on SS is possible with only one computing server. Moreover, we show that the entire computation process can be disclosed if the key is managed safely. We realize a method that solves the disadvantages of conventional approaches with a faster computation than those methods.}

Novel defense mechanisms against web threats have emerged, from URL parsing via Machine Learning to JavaScript deep graph analysis. In this study, we consider the problem of generating Adversarial Examples to evade URL classifiers. We propose a neural network architecture that will be able to generate synthetic URLs for a variety of attacks that will evade existing security classifiers. The main focus of the literature is on classifiers for phishing URLs, but in this work we aim to extend it to other attacks like Drive-by-Download. Our system splits the URL at the word level before substituting words with symbols. This approach contrasts with the existing literature that works on the character level without semantic considerations. We also envision a combination of the word level generation with a character level analysis by a Convolutional Neural Network to improve the evasion capacity of the synthetic samples.}

We first outline the problem, provide the background on reinforcement learning and detail our proposed agent design. Using a network environment simulation, with 13 hosts spanning 3 subnets, we train a novel reinforcement learning agent and show that it can reliably defend continual attacks by two advanced persistent threat (APT) red agents: one with complete knowledge of the network layout and another which must discover resources through exploration but is more general.}

	abstract = {Mobile application developers sometimes might not be serious about source code security and publish apps to the marketplaces. Therefore, it is essential to have a fully automated security solutions generator to integrate security-by-design into the development practices, especially for the Android platform. This research proposes a Machine Learning (ML) based highly accurate method to detect Android source code vulnerabilities. A new labelled dataset containing Android source code vulnerability samples was generated initially. The dataset was used to train binary and multi-class classification based ML models, to identify code issues by following a static analysis approach. The proposed model can detect code vulnerabilities with a 0.90 F1-Score and vulnerability categories (CWE) with a 0.96 F1-Score. By integrating this with the Android development environment, app developers can analyse source code and identify security vulnerabilities in real-time. The proposed framework can be extended to suggest suitable patches to overcome the source code issues by providing real-time fixes in future.}

	abstract = {The development of techniques for creating completely synthetic photographic images and videos, as well as the increasing prevalence of disinformation associated with such synthetic media, have sparked interest in the computer community. One such issue is the proliferation of deepfakes. However, much of the research is devoted to outwitting the SOTA in order to generate and detect fabricated images and video. Considering them from the perspective of computer security and human ethics is largely ignored. As such, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and methodologies, as well as to provide academia and industry with insights into the development and identification of fake media from a computer security perspective.}

	abstract = {Malware is a term used for computer software created for malicious purposes. The rise of malware has closely followed the rise of computers in the society, and in~2022 it represents a ubiquitous threat in the digital world, impacting individuals, organizations and governments. As a reaction to the emergence of malware, the new research direction malware analysis was established. Unlike most other domains of computer science, malware analysis operates in an actively adversarial environment, where the potential reward for attackers is very high, and their maneuvering space is ample. Under such conditions, an arms race has arisen between attackers and defenders. A crucial condition necessary to prevail in this race is the research of robust methods and solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in the field in a joint forum for advancing the robustness of malware analysis.}
