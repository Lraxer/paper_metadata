	abstract = {Bootstrapping in approximate homomorphic encryption involves evaluating the modular reduction function. Traditional methods decompose the modular reduction function into three components: scaled cosine, double-angle formula, and inverse sine. While these approaches offer a strong trade-off between computational cost and level consumption, they lack flexibility in parameterization. In this work, we propose a new method to decompose the modular reduction function with improved parameterization, generalizing prior trigonometric approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal approximation errors. Additionally, we introduce a technique that integrates the rescaling operation into matrix operations during bootstrapping, further reducing computational overhead.}

	abstract = {Optimizing Boolean circuits presents a considerable challenge, especially when aiming to construct circuits amenable to Fully Homomorphic Encryption\xa0(FHE) schemes. FHE enables arbitrary computations on encrypted data but incorporates a computationally intensive operation called  bootstrapping , necessary for reducing noise in ciphertexts to facilitate computations on circuits of arbitrary depth. This operation can consume a substantial amount of time, depending on the size of the circuits. To address this issue, we propose a technique for efficiently synthesizing circuits specific to FHE by utilizing multi-input homogeneous and composite Boolean gates. Following this we develop an automated framework for designing efficient circuits compatible with FHE schemes. In this work, we use Torus-FHE\xa0(TFHE) (JoC 2019), a widely used FHE scheme for Boolean circuits due to its fast bootstrapping operation per bit. Existing techniques typically employ either multi-input homogeneous gates or, multi-bit Look-Up tables during circuit synthesis, which often limits their ability to produce highly optimized circuits for FHE. Our approach addresses this limitation by proposing viable multi-input composite gates alongwith the homogeneous gates during circuit synthesis. Additionally, we propose an efficient and lightweight circuit synthesis approach based on graph optimization. Our approach identifies convex sub-graphs in a Directed Acyclic Graph\xa0(DAG) representing the input circuit and replaces them with a more compact structure. This results in a reduction of the number of nodes in the DAG and so as the number of Boolean gates in the input circuit. Our proposed framework provides the most efficient Boolean circuits for TFHE till date, achieving up to a 20% improvement in homomorphic evaluation time compared to the state-of-the-art general compiler optimization techniques for TFHE, and it also demonstrates a 4-6 × improvement over prior work on FHEW-like schemes.}

	abstract = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is one of the most important components of privacy computing, theoretically allowing arbitrary computations to be performed on encrypted data. Since leveled FHE schemes only support arithmetic operations, one of the most crucial issues is how to rapidly compute polynomial evaluations. The most famous Peterson-Stockmeyer algorithm, a recursive version of the Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) algorithm, requires  2 d + O ( log \u2061 d )  non-scalar multiplications, where  d  is the degree of the polynomial being evaluated. In this paper, we leverage the observation that the baby-step set in the BSGS algorithm is located at a shallower level compared to the giant-step set. We propose the  Asymmetric BSGS Algorithm  that, by utilizing set decomposition and lazy techniques, reduces the number of modulus and key switches to  O ( d 1/ t ), where  t  ≥ 3 is a constant. This algorithm works on any leveled FHE and any polynomial, providing performance enhancements of up to 350% for degree-65536 polynomials when implemented on BGV. When applied to bootstrapping, the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of both the leveled FHE bootstrapping and the amortized bootstrapping of LWE based on leveled FHE by more than a factor of 2.}

	abstract = {Recently, single-server private information retrieval (PIR) with preprocessing has been suggested to achieve sublinear online server computation, with query-independent information precomputed and stored by the server/client. While state-of-the-art preprocessing solutions, such as FrodoPIR and SimplePIR, fail to achieve sublinear online time, they are fairly simple and concretely efficient. However, these schemes are inefficient for database updates, requiring each client to redownload a “new” portion of the hint for any updates. Moreover, they suffer from high client storage requirements and online communication, which is client-unfriendly. In this paper, we propose a more client friendly and updatable single-server PIR with preprocessing. In particular, we define the notion of Symmetric key-based Simulatable Fully Homomorphic Encryption ( SS - FHE ). Specifically, it is an FHE scheme with an extra property we call simulatability, which allows simulation of a qualified homomorphic ciphertext without sampling a secret key. Based on this concept, we show how to construct a generic PIR with preprocessing that provides native support for database updates and eliminates the need for client storage. Furthermore, we offer an implementation of the TFHE-based instantiation on Ubuntu, which shows the feasibility of our scheme. Although the instantiation is limited to 1-bit databases and and incurs higher online time, our approach lays the groundwork for more practical and scalable PIR solutions.}

	abstract = {Multi-Key Fully Homomorphic Encryption ( MKFHE ) schemes represent a significant advancement in cryptographic technology, enabling multiple parties to perform arbitrary computations on data encrypted under different keys. These schemes utilize the complex ciphertext extension algorithms that extend the ciphertexts encrypted by the public key of a single party to the ciphertexts encrypted under all the participants’ public keys, enabling collaborative evaluation. However, this process often compromises efficiency by increasing ciphertext size and requiring intricate operations. Moreover, the hardness of the majority of existing  MKFHE  schemes based on lattice problems such as Learning with Errors ( LWE ) or Ring Learning with Errors ( RLWE ) necessitates extensive sampling from error distributions. This approach leads to substantial noise propagation after only a few operations, limiting the scheme’s practical utility. By addressing these key challenges, our work proposes a more streamlined and efficient Key Extension Multi-key Fully Homomorphic Encryption ( MKEFHE ) scheme based on the Learning with Rounding ( LWR ) problem, which eliminates the need for a complex ciphertext extension algorithm and an error distribution.}

	abstract = {Lookup arguments enable a prover to convince a verifier that a committed vector of lookup elements  f → ∈ F m  is contained within a predefined table  T ∈ F N . These arguments are particularly beneficial for enhancing the performance of SNARKs in handling non-arithmetic operations, such as batched range checks or bitwise operations. While existing works have achieved efficient and succinct lookup arguments, challenges remain, particularly when dealing with large vectors of lookup elements in privacy-sensitive applications. In this paper, we introduce  D U P L E X , a scalable zero-knowledge lookup argument scheme that offers significant improvements over previous approaches. Notably, we present the first lookup argument designed to operate over the RSA group. Our core technique allows for the transformation of elements into prime numbers to ensure compatibility with the RSA group, all without imposing substantial computational costs on the prover. Given  m  lookup elements,  D U P L E X  achieves an asymptotic proving time of  O ( m log\u2009 m ), with constant-sized proofs, and constant-time verification. Additionally,  D U P L E X  ensures the privacy of lookup elements and is robust against dynamic table updates, making it highly suitable for scalable verifiable computation in real-world applications. We implemented and empirically evaluated  D U P L E X , comparing it with the state-of-the-art zero-knowledge lookup argument Caulk [CCS’22]. Our experimental results demonstrate that  D U P L E X  significantly outperforms Caulk in proving time for both single and batched lookup arguments, while maintaining practical proof size and verification time.}

	abstract = {Real-Time Pricing\xa0(RTP) is a core smart grid functionality that periodically relays pricing signals to end-users based on their fine-grained power consumption data. However, a growing concern revolves around potential information leakage from this consumption data. While existing solutions address this privacy concern by adopting information-theoretic and cryptographic techniques, including differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, we investigate Multi-Party Computation\xa0(MPC) to achieve privacy-preserving RTP. Despite extensive research in the MPC domain, the current techniques need to be reinvestigated for the problem at hand. In particular, we highlight that for RTP evaluations, the critical operation is division, where both the numerator and denominator are private. In such cases, the currently reported MPC methods use fixed-point arithmetic, approximations, and precomputations, resulting in large communication overheads and lower computational accuracy. This paper overcomes the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel MPC technique for precise division using IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, achieving RTP accuracy up to 10 − 10  for a million consumers, an improvement of at least five orders of magnitude over existing MPC-based approaches. The proposed MPC-based RTP scheme ensures constant communication and computation overhead per consumer and provides formal security guarantees under real-world/ideal-world simulation paradigm. We evaluate the feasibility of our scheme through extensive experiments, including consumer-side validation with an in-house developed smart meter, demonstrating price stabilization and significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art MPC solutions.}

	abstract = {The private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to know the intersection of their sets securely without revealing anything else. Many PSI protocols have been proposed, and many efficient schemes are based on  oblivious pseudorandom functions  (OPRF) built from oblivious transfer (OT). In this paper, we first propose a computationally friendly OPRF protocol by combining an OT extension (Crypto’03) with an  oblivious key-value store  (OKVS). By directly utilizing our OPRF protocol, we propose our PSI protocol. Compared with the most computationally friendly OT-based PSI protocol KKRT (CCS’16), our protocol can overcome the uncertainty issue of cuckoo hashing and runs  22.3 % ∼ 41.2 %  faster. Compared with spot-low (Crypto’19) that has the lowest communication costs among the OT-based protocols, our protocol can run 69.5 × ∼124.6 × faster than it with only  22 % ∼ 23 %  more communication cost. CM (Crypto’20) aimed to balance computation and communication costs in their protocol such that it can run the fastest when the bandwidth is not high and not low. Our protocol outperforms CM in all settings with  5.8 % ∼ 6.4 %  less communication costs. By utilizing our OPRF protocol, we also propose a more functional  oblivious programmable pseudorandom function  (OPPRF) protocol, allowing a party to securely obtain the payloads that correspond to common items. Our OPPRF protocol can be 1.7 × ∼2.4 × as fast as the state-of-the-art OPPRF protocol (Eurocrypt’21) in the LAN setting.}

	abstract = {Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) allows multiple parties to perform privacy-preserving computation on their secret data. MPC protocols based on secret sharing have high throughput which makes them well-suited for batch processing, where multiple instances are evaluated in parallel. So far, practical implementations of secret sharing-based MPC protocols mainly focus on runtime and communication efficiency, so the memory overhead of protocol implementations is often overlooked. Established techniques to reduce the memory overhead for constant-round garbled circuit protocols cannot be directly applied to secret sharing-based protocols because they would increase the round complexity. Additionally, state-of-the-art implementations of secret sharing-based MPC protocols are implemented in C/C++ and may exhibit memory unsafety and memory leaks, which could lead to undefined behavior. In this paper, we present SEEC:  S EEC  E xecutes  E normous  C ircuits, a framework for secret sharing-based MPC with a novel approach to address memory efficiency and safety without compromising on runtime and communication efficiency. We realize SEEC in Rust, a language known for memory-safety at close-to-native speed. To reduce the memory footprint, we develop an in-memory representation for sub-circuits. Thus, we never inline sub-circuit calls during circuit evaluation, a common issue that blows up memory usage in MPC implementations. We compare SEEC with the state-of-the-art secret sharing-based MPC frameworks ABY\xa0(NDSS’15), MP-SPDZ\xa0(CCS’20), and MOTION\xa0(TOPS’22) w.r.t. runtime, memory, and communication efficiency.

	abstract = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables two or more mutually distrustful parties to jointly compute the intersection of their sets, while revealing nothing beyond that intersection. Recently, a line of multiparty PSI has been explored in a malicious adversary model, i.e., any participant may deviate from the protocol. However, most of the works require a designated leader party to compute the intersection first by interacting with other parties, which brings heavy communication overhead for the leader. In addition, how to distribute the intersection fairly while preventing selective disclosure or premature aborts remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel server-aided fair multiparty PSI protocol from lightweight cryptographic primitives, including oblivious key-value stores (OKVS) and oblivious pseudorandom functions (OPRFs). More concretely, our construction offloads heavy communication and computation tasks to the cloud server, which significantly alleviates the leader party’s workload. Moreover, the cloud sends a blinded intersection to all participants simultaneously, ensuring fair intersection recovery for all parties. Experimental results demonstrate that our protocol achieves overall performance comparable to the state-of-the-art (Nevo et al., CCS’21), while reducing the leader’s communication overhead by 2.61–29.67 ×.}

However, the situation is currently less satisfactory for other relevant\xa0PSO problems such as private set union\xa0(PSU): For\xa0PSU, the most promising protocols either rely entirely on computationally expensive public-key operations or suffer from substantial communication overhead. In this work, we present the first\xa0PSU protocol that is mainly based on efficient symmetric-key primitives yet enjoys comparable communication as public-key-based alternatives.

Our protocol is modularly designed as a sequential execution of different building blocks that can be easily replaced by more efficient variants in the future, which will directly benefit the overall performance.

	abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) is a fundamental technique used in machine learning (ML) training for protecting the privacy of sensitive individual user data. In the past few years, a new approach for combining  prior-based  Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanisms with a relaxed DP criterion, known as Label DP, has shown great promise in increasing the utility of the final trained model without compromising on the DP privacy budget. In this work, we identify a crucial privacy gap in the current implementations of these prior-based LDP mechanisms, namely the leakage of sensitive priors. We address the challenge of implementing such LDP mechanisms  without  leaking any information about the priors while preserving the efficiency and accuracy of the current insecure implementations. To that end, we design simple and efficient secure two-party computation (2PC) protocols for addressing this challenge, implement them, and perform end-to-end testing on standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10. Our empirical results indicate that the added security benefit essentially comes almost for “free” in the sense that the gap between the current insecure implementations and our proposed secure version, in terms of runtime overhead and accuracy degradation, is minimal. E.g., for CIFAR-10, with strong DP privacy parameter, the additional runtime due to 2PC is  ≈ 3.9 %  over WAN with  0.4 %  decrease in accuracy over an insecure (non-2PC) approach.}

	abstract = {Google introduced the Falcon channel protocol for efficient data exchange over unreliable networks in its data centers. The protocol augments Google’s basic PSP channel protocol for secure transportation through mechanisms like replay protection and congestion control and provides request-response-based interfaces for upper-layer protocols. Falcon has recently been opened to the public as part of the Open Compute Project, describing the design and choices as Falcon Transport Protocol Specification. We analyze Falcon here in the recently introduced security model of Fischlin et al.\xa0(Journal of Cryptology, 2024) for channel protocols, which is particularly applicable to unreliable networks and security properties like replay protection. In passing, we also investigate the security of PSP on which Falcon is based. Our results indicate that PSP and Falcon provide adequate security, albeit our studies also reveal several security-related ambiguities in the specification.}

	abstract = {Recently, anamorphic cryptography became a rapidly developing branch of covert information channels technology. The novel feature is that such channels remain undetectable even if the (official) user keys are surrendered to an auditor. Rejection Sampling is the most universal technique for creating such channels, applicable to most protocols used in practice. On the downside, its bandwidth is practically limited to a few bits, while randomized execution time may enable channel detection via side-channel analysis. To some extent, we eliminate these limitations by applying smart Advance Sampling with a relatively small dynamic lookup table (LUT). Even though the entries in LUT are produced and consumed at random, we keep LUT stable by using a symmetric power-of-two-choices strategy for insertion and removal. Contrary to the classical Rejection Sampling, the computation time of Advance Sampling is constant, while the bandwidth of the covert channel increases substantially. For example, a 16-bit covert channel can be achieved without a slowdown of order 2 15 . Due to the improved bandwidth, Advance Sampling can be used as a pragmatic protection against quantum threats. In particular, it may be utilized to “fish out” most signatures forged by an adversary with compromised keys.}

	abstract = {Zero-Knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol between two parties called the prover  P  and the verifier  V , in which  P  convinces  V  that it knows certain secret information that satisfies a program without revealing the secret. Intended for practicality, a key characteristic of ZK proof is succinctness, allowing the verifier to quickly validate the proof. However, this succinctness usually leads to the trade-off in proof generation time and has constituted the bottleneck in adopting ZK proof into real-world applications. Among the efforts to reduce the prover’s time, HyperPlonk - a novel SNARK - suggests migrating from univariate to multivariate polynomials, hence removing the expensive cost in interpolating the polynomials. In addition, a subroutine called  lookup argument  can be embedded inside a SNARK to speed up the proving process while also supporting circuit gates for complex functions. In this paper, we present LogaLookup, a novel multivariate lookup argument designed for accelerated proof generation using logarithmic derivative. Our scheme is able to support high-degree lookup achieves a faster proving time than Plookup - the multivariate lookup argument scheme proposed alongside HyperPlonk - by eliminating the need for higher-degree intermediate polynomials. Consequently, benchmarking results demonstrate that our scheme achieves proof generation times that are 2.5x faster than those of Plookup, while maintaining minimal impact on verifier performance. We also propose the integration of our lookup argument scheme into HyperPlonk+ to construct a complete lookup-embedded SNARK system.}

	abstract = {We propose  PCS_AC  – a new cryptographic framework for post-compromise security (PCS) in secure-communication protocols, which caters not only for the traditional PCS-corruption of key material, but also for adversarial controls of a PCS-nature  at the application level . That is, we study and formalise when and how  an adversary can maintain or lose post-compromise advantages due to application-driven controls as well, rather than do so based on cryptographic manipulations and settings alone . In fact, the motivation and ideas in our  PCS_AC  are in line with a recent document by NIST\xa0[ 14 ], where adversarial application-level influence on key compromise are discussed, and it is the first of this kind to be produced. Since measures of PCS “healing” are discrete, we also mechanised an approximation of our cryptographic  PCS_AC  framework, in symbolic/Dolev-Yao models, as well; we do this in the two state-of-the-art protocol verifiers,  ProVerif  and  Tamarin , and –in the process– we also compare and discuss different tool-assistance aspects in each. We include a summary of this in this version of the paper, too. We apply  PCS_AC  to the 5G procedure called  AKMA (Authentication and Key Management for Application) , showing new PCS-attacks therein and proposing patches, including a backwards-compatible one. We implement and test AKMA as well as of one of our PCS-driven patches, on top of Fraunhofer’s  Open5GCore . We also cast ‘TLS1.3 with session resumption and key updates’ in  PCS_AC  in various ways, looking at different keys being potentially targeted by one type of attacker or another, amongst the multiple possible choices formalised in  PCS_AC . This captures new and varied PCS dimensions of TLS, underlining the versatility and usefulness of our framework.}

	abstract = {Since the selection of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization algorithms, research on integrating PQC into security protocols such as TLS/SSL, IPSec, and DNSSEC has been actively pursued. However, PQC migration for Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols remains largely unexplored. Embedded devices in IoT environments have limited computational power and memory, making it crucial to optimize PQC algorithms for efficient computation and minimal memory usage when deploying them on low-spec IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce KEM-MQTT, a lightweight and efficient Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely used in IoT environments. Our approach applies the NIST KEM algorithm Crystals-Kyber (Kyber) while leveraging MQTT’s characteristics and sensor node constraints. To enhance efficiency, we address certificate verification issues and adopt KEMTLS\xa0[ 72 ] to eliminate the need for Post-Quantum Digital Signatures Algorithm (PQC-DSA) in mutual authentication. As a result, KEM-MQTT retains its lightweight properties while maintaining the security guarantees of TLS 1.3. We identify inefficiencies in existing Kyber implementations on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (MCUs), which are highly resource-constrained. To address this, we propose novel implementation techniques that optimize Kyber for AVR, focusing on high-speed execution, reduced memory consumption, and secure implementation, including Signed LookUp-Table (LUT) Reduction. Our optimized Kyber achieves performance gains of 81%,75%, and 85% in the KeyGen, Encaps, and DeCaps processes, respectively, compared to the reference implementation. With approximately 3 KB of stack usage, our Kyber implementation surpasses all state-of-the-art Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) implementations. Finally, in KEM-MQTT using Kyber-512, an 8-bit AVR device completes the handshake preparation process in 4.32 seconds, excluding the physical transmission and reception times.}

	abstract = {Prior research on ensuring trust in delegated computation through lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs mostly rely on Learning-With-Errors ( LWE ) assumption. In this work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge using the Ring Learning with Rounding ( RLWR ) assumption for an interesting and useful class of statements: linear relations on polynomials. We begin by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first efficient commitment scheme in literature based on the hardness of  RLWR \xa0 assumption. We establish two properties on  RLWR \xa0that aid in the construction of our commitments: ① closure under addition with double rounding, and ② closure under multiplication with a short polynomial. Building upon our  RLWR \xa0commitment scheme, we consequently design a  RLWR \xa0based  Σ 2  protocol for proving knowledge of a single committed message under linear relations with public polynomials. As an use-case of our proposed  Σ 2  protocol, we showcase a construction of a quantum-safe Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme by plugging a prior  LWR  based SSE scheme from (EuroS&P 2023) with our  Σ 2  protocol. Concretely, using our  Σ 2  protocol for linear relations, we prove the correctness of an encrypted search result in a zero-knowledge manner. We implement our verifiable SSE framework and show that the overhead of an extra verification round is negligible (0.0023 seconds) and retains the asymptotic query execution time complexity of the original SSE scheme. Our work establishes results on zero-knowledge proof systems that can be of independent interest. By shifting the setting from  RLWE  to  RLWR , we gain significant ① efficiency improvements in terms of communication complexity by  O ( M ) (since some prior works on  RLWE  require rejection sampling by a factor of  M ), as well as ② very short proof size (8.4 KB) and tighter parameters (since  RLWR  does not explicitly manipulate error polynomials like  RLWE ).}

While Signal’s PQXDH key exchange protocol addresses post-quantum confidentiality, full migration of the X3DH protocol remains elusive. Relying on a split KEM ( K - Waay , USENIX ’24) offers a promising migration path, but it has so far suffered from size limitations compared to concurrent works leveraging ring signatures. This work introduces  Sparrow - KEM  and  Sym - Sparrow - KEM , novel asymmetric and symmetric split KEMs respectively, i.e. for which keys can be used interchangeably for sending and receiving, or only in one direction. They are designed to optimize the  K - Waay  protocol for size efficiency. Leveraging the  MLWE  assumption, these constructions reduce by a factor 5.1 × the communication of prior post-quantum X3DH based on split KEMs, plus provides a 40 × speedup. Additionally,  Sym - Sparrow - KEM  is the first symmetric split-KEM to offer deniability,  IND-1KCA , and  IND-1BatchCCA  security, capturing implicit authentication properties. We provide formal security proofs for both schemes, including deniability. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a compact and deniable post-quantum X3DH protocol based on split KEMs.}

Nevertheless, existing AKE mechanisms based on traditional cryptographic techniques rely on integer factorization and discrete logarithms, which are no longer safe with the advent of quantum computers. These shortcomings motivate us to design a cutting-edge Quantum Secure Authentication and Key-Establishment mechanism (QSAKE) for the IoD environment. To the best of our knowledge, QSAKE is the pioneered work that uses advanced quantum-safe cryptography, providing a strong defence beyond traditional methods. To further enhance security, it eliminates storing long-term secrets directly in drone memory, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Specifically, we implement and evaluate four PQ signatures in the Ethereum Virtual Machine: W-OTS + , XMSS, SPHINCS+, and MAYO. We focus on optimizing the gas costs of the verification algorithms as that is the signature schemes’ only algorithm executed on-chain, thus incurring financial costs (transaction fees) for the users. Hence, the verification algorithm is the signature schemes’ main bottleneck for decentralized applications. We examine two methods to verify post-quantum digital signatures on-chain. Our practical performance evaluation shows that full on-chain verification is often prohibitively costly. Naysayer proofs (FC’24) allow a novel optimistic verification mode. We observe that the Naysayer verification mode is generally the cheapest, at the cost of additional trust assumptions. We release our implementation called  poqeth  as an open-source library.}

	abstract = {Misconfiguration poses a ubiquitous security vulnerability for even modern hardened systems. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based penetration testing have proven its efficacy in vulnerability detection. Prior research has predominantly focused on large, non-local models, evaluating them exclusively on Linux and Windows systems. We developed  Perses , an extensible multi-LLM framework based on heterogeneity in model selection and task decomposition, designed to enable small local models to autonomously detect and exploit misconfiguration vulnerabilities.  Perses  is evaluated on a FreeBSD port of an existing privilege escalation benchmark, analyzing the effects of heterogeneity, the viability of automatic LLM assignment, the criticality of introduced LLM-roles, and the detriment incurred through evaluation on a system the models have little inherent knowledge on. Experimental results reveal that  Perses , in its default configuration, enables Small Models to consistently exploit 87.5% of the evaluated vulnerabilities, significantly improving upon the 12.5% reported in prior work. We further find that SMAC-based automatic configuration is feasible, each role is essential for  Perses ’ performance, and that the models contain sufficient knowledge on FreeBSD. These results showcase the power of Small Models in privilege escalation, presenting a viable alternative to Large Models.}

	abstract = {While convenient, relying on LLM-powered code assistants in day-to-day work gives rise to severe attacks. For instance, the assistant might introduce subtle flaws and suggest vulnerable code to the user. These  adversarial code-suggestions  can be introduced via data poisoning and, thus, unknowingly by the model creators. In this paper, we provide a generalized formulation of such attacks, spawning and extending related work in this domain. Our formulation is defined over two components: First, a trigger pattern occurring in the prompts of a specific user group, and, second, a learnable map in embedding space from the prompt to an adversarial bait. The\xa0latter gives rise to novel and more flexible  targeted  attack-strategies, allowing the adversary to choose the most suitable trigger pattern for a specific user-group arbitrarily, without restrictions on its tokens. Our directional-map attacks and prompt-indexing attacks increase the stealthiness decisively. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks and carefully investigate defensive mechanisms to explore the limits of  generalized adversarial code-suggestions . We find that most defenses offer little protection only.}

	abstract = {Penetration testing is a critical technique for identifying security vulnerabilities, traditionally performed manually by skilled security specialists. This complex process involves gathering information about the target system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting findings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is time-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and resources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration testing methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world applications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and implementation. Recent advancements in large language models offer new opportunities for enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and automation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant challenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of comprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose  PentestAgent , a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that leverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like retrieval augmented generation to enhance penetration testing knowledge and automate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate  PentestAgent  using a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion and overall efficiency.}

	abstract = {Software vulnerabilities (SVs) have emerged as a prevalent and crucial concern for safety-critical systems. This has spurred significant advancements in utilizing AI-based methods, including machine learning and deep learning, for software vulnerability detection (SVD). While AI-based methods have shown promising performance in SVD, their effectiveness on real-world, complex, and diverse source code datasets remains limited in practice. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances the capability of large language models to learn and utilize semantic and syntactic relationships from source code data for SVD. As a result, our proposed  SAFE \xa0approach can enable the acquisition of fundamental knowledge from source code data while adeptly utilizing crucial relationships, i.e., semantic and syntactic associations, to improve the effectiveness of solving the SVD problem. The rigorous and extensive experimental results on three real-world challenging datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and D2A) demonstrate the superiority of our approach over eight effective and state-of-the-art baselines. In summary, on average, our  SAFE \xa0approach achieves higher performances from 4.79% to  11.57%  for F1-measure and from 16.93% to  26.24%  for Recall compared to the baseline methods across all the datasets used.}

	abstract = {Vishing is a form of social engineering where attackers deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, or security credentials via phone calls, exploiting the perceived urgency and authenticity of voice communication to manipulate victims, often posing as legitimate entities like banks or tech support. Vishing is a particularly serious threat as it bypasses security controls designed to protect information. In this work, we study the potential for vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered software bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating conversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into disclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing, an AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology. It relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to steer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone calls. Through a controlled social experiment involving 240 participants, we discovered that ViKing has successfully persuaded many participants to reveal sensitive information, even those who had been explicitly warned about the risk of vishing campaigns. Interactions with ViKing’s bots were generally considered realistic. From these findings, we conclude that tools like ViKing may already be accessible to potential malicious actors, while also serving as an invaluable resource for cyber awareness programs.}

While LLMs offer significant technological progress, their development using vast amounts of user data scraped from the web and collected from extensive user interactions poses risks of sensitive information leakage. Most existing surveys focus on the privacy implications of the training data but tend to overlook privacy risks from user interactions and advanced LLM capabilities. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of privacy in LLMs, categorizing the challenges into four main areas: (i) privacy issues in LLM training data, (ii) privacy challenges associated with user prompts, (iii) privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-generated outputs, and (iv) privacy challenges involving LLM agents. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of existing mitigation mechanisms targeting these proposed privacy challenges and identify areas for further research.}

	abstract = {With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First, ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner. Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level of watermark accuracy.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model without sharing their raw data. However, the decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their local models to disrupt the training process. While Byzantine-robust aggregation rules have been developed to mitigate such attacks, they remain inadequate against more advanced threats. In response, recent advancements have focused on FL detection techniques to identify potentially malicious participants. Unfortunately, these methods often misclassify numerous benign clients as threats or rely on unrealistic assumptions about the server’s capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm,  SafeFL , specifically designed to accurately identify malicious clients in FL. The  SafeFL  approach involves the server collecting a series of global models to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to distinguish between malicious and benign models based on their behavior. Extensive testing demonstrates that  SafeFL  outperforms existing methods, offering superior efficiency and accuracy in detecting malicious clients.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative model training while keeping client data decentralized and private. However, it is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as “LoKI” and “Robbing the Fed”, where malicious models sent from the server to the client can reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor’s performance against the advanced LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor’s effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets containing 500 samples per client.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature‐extraction performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy‐leakage risks. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the  p -norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack (LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical distribution characteristics of the  p -norm of feature vectors. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy.

	abstract = {Fine-tuning large models can be computationally expensive, posing a challenge for individual users, especially those lacking expertise and computational resources, to create customized models. While many remote servers are available for large-scale training, directly sending raw data to servers may lead to significant security concerns. To improve data privacy, one can divide the model into a small local module and a large remote module, train the local module with their data and send only intermediate output to a remote server for further training. This approach is called split learning. However, recent studies have shown that split learning, even without raw data sharing, is still not immune to data reconstruction attacks as the intermediate output carries information about the input data. In this paper, we focus on uncovering the elevated data leakage vulnerabilities in large generative AI models like Stable Diffusion, in the context of  split fine-tuning . We show that the adversary has more advanced knowledge about the client than usual, as demonstrated through our devised data reconstruction attacks. To enhance the security of split fine-tuning when faced with data reconstruction attacks, we design a novel defense based on self-attacking and dropout technique for accommodating varying privacy leakage risks from different cut layers, which protects the intermediate output while having the least impact on model utility and training efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art split learning defenses.}

	abstract = {The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to  black-box adversarial attacks  is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present  BayAtk . Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of  BayAtk  in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks.}

	abstract = {The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit,  STAG , which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google’s security enhancements. Compared to prior methods,  STAG  achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.}

	abstract = {Vulnerabilities in open-source software can cause cascading effects in the modern digital ecosystem. It is especially worrying if these vulnerabilities repeat across many projects, as once the adversaries find one of them, they can scale up the attack very easily. Unfortunately, since developers frequently reuse code from their own or external code resources, some nearly identical vulnerabilities exist across many open-source projects. We conducted a study to examine the prevalence of a particular vulnerable code pattern that enables path traversal attacks (CWE-22) across open-source GitHub projects. To handle this study at the GitHub scale, we developed an automated pipeline that scans GitHub for the targeted vulnerable pattern, confirms the vulnerability by first running a static analysis and then exploiting the vulnerability in the context of the studied project, assesses its impact by calculating the CVSS score, generates a patch using GPT-4, and reports the vulnerability to the maintainers. Using our pipeline, we identified 1,756 vulnerable open-source projects, some of which are very influential. For many of the affected projects, the vulnerability is critical (CVSS score higher than 9.0), as it can be exploited remotely without any privileges and critically impact the confidentiality and availability of the system. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the maintainers, and 14% of the reported vulnerabilities have been remediated. We also investigated the root causes of the vulnerable code pattern and assessed the side effects of the large number of copies of this vulnerable pattern that seem to have poisoned several popular LLMs. Our study highlights the urgent need to help secure the open-source ecosystem by leveraging scalable automated vulnerability management solutions and raising awareness among developers.}

	abstract = {The rise of AI voice-cloning technology, particularly audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs), has intensified social engineering attacks by enabling real-time voice impersonation that bypasses conventional enrollment-based authentication. This technology represents an existential threat to phone-based authentication systems, while total identity fraud losses reached $43 billion. Between 2022-23, deepfake attempts occured once every five minutes, with 26% of Americans reporting they have encountered deepfake scams and 9% falling victim. Unlike traditional robocalls, these personalized AI-generated voice attacks target high-value accounts and circumvent existing defensive measures, creating an urgent cybersecurity challenge. To address this, we propose  Pitch , a robust challenge-response method to detect and tag interactive deepfake audio calls. We developed a comprehensive taxonomy of audio challenges based on the human auditory system, linguistics, and environmental factors, yielding 20 prospective challenges. Testing against leading voice-cloning systems using a novel dataset (18,600 original and 1.6 million deepfake samples from 100 users),  Pitch ’s challenges enhanced machine detection capabilities to 88.7% AUROC score, enabling us to identify 10 highly-effective challenges. For human evaluation, we filtered a challenging, balanced subset on which human evaluators independently achieved 72.6% accuracy, while machines scored 87.7%. Recognizing that call environments require human control, we developed a novel human-AI collaborative system that tags suspicious calls as "Deepfake-likely." Contrary to prior findings, we discovered that integrating human intuition with machine precision offers complementary advantages, giving users maximum control while boosting detection accuracy to 84.5%. This significant improvement situates  Pitch ’s potential as an AI-assisted pre-screener for verifying calls, offering an adaptable approach to combat real-time voice-cloning attacks while maintaining human decision authority.

	abstract = {Ransomware attacks have caused billions of dollars in damages in recent years, and are expected to cause billions more in the future. Consequently, significant effort has been devoted to ransomware detection and mitigation. Behavioral-based ransomware detection approaches have garnered considerable attention recently. These behavioral detectors typically rely on process-based behavioral profiles to identify malicious behaviors. However, with an increasing body of literature highlighting the vulnerability of such approaches to evasion attacks, a comprehensive solution to the ransomware problem remains elusive. This paper presents Minerva, a novel robust approach to ransomware detection. Minerva is engineered to be robust by design against evasion attacks, with architectural and feature selection choices informed by their resilience to adversarial manipulation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of Minerva across a diverse spectrum of ransomware types, encompassing unseen ransomware as well as variants designed specifically to evade Minerva. Our evaluation showcases the ability of Minerva to accurately identify ransomware, generalize to unseen threats, and withstand evasion attacks. Furthermore, over  99 %  of detected ransomware are identified within 0.52 sec  of activity, enabling the adoption of data loss prevention techniques with near-zero overhead.}

	abstract = {Recent years have seen an unprecedented increase in phishing attacks, threatening the security of Internet users. In response, studies have explored defenses that automatically identify the intentions of suspicious websites. Most defenses work by employing machine learning models that examine different components of a website,  e.g. , logos or areas asking login credentials. However, the robustness of this emerging approach against evasive adversaries is not well understood. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of recent phishing detectors against evasion attacks. We first conduct an extensive literature review to identify common mistakes in evaluating their adversarial robustness. We then develop evasion attacks to assess the true robustness of reference-based phishing detectors. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art phishing detectors, PhishIntention and Dynaphish, shows that they are significantly less robust in adversarial settings than demonstrated in the original studies. We also analyze the factors attributing to these vulnerabilities and suggest potential research directions for developing robust detectors.}

	abstract = {The exploration of backdoor vulnerabilities in object detectors, particularly in  real-world scenarios , remains limited. A significant challenge lies in the absence of a natural physical backdoor dataset, and constructing such a dataset is both time- and labor-intensive. In this work, we address this gap by creating a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 11,800 images/frames with annotations featuring natural objects (e.g., T-shirts and hats) as triggers to incur cloaking adversarial effects in diverse real-world scenarios. This dataset is tailored for the study of physical backdoors in object detectors. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of an insidious cloaking backdoor effect against object detectors, wherein the bounding box around a person vanishes when the individual is near a natural object (e.g., a commonly available T-shirt) in front of the detector. Our evaluations encompass three prevalent attack surfaces: data outsourcing, model outsourcing, and the use of pretrained models. The cloaking effect is successfully implanted in object detectors across all three attack surfaces. We extensively evaluate four popular object detection algorithms (anchor-based Yolo-V3, Yolo-V4, Faster R-CNN, and anchor-free CenterNet) using 19 videos (totaling approximately 11,800 frames) in real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the backdoor attack exhibits remarkable robustness against  various factors, including movement, distance, angle, non-rigid deformation, and lighting . In data and model outsourcing scenarios, the attack success rate (ASR) in most videos reaches 100% or near it, while the clean data accuracy of the backdoored model remains indistinguishable from that of the clean model, making it impossible to detect backdoor behavior through a validation set. Notably, two-stage object detectors (e.g., Faster R-CNN) show greater resistance to backdoor attacks under pure data poisoning conditions (i.e., in data outsourcing) compared to one-stage detectors (e.g., the Yolo series). However, this challenge is surmountable when the attacker controls the training process (particularly in model outsourcing), even with the same small poisoning rate budget as in data outsourcing. In transfer learning attack scenarios assessed on CenterNet, the average ASR remains high at 78%. A detailed 5-minute video illustrating our attack is available at  https://youtu.be/Q3HOF4OobbY .}

Existing research has been inadequate in effectively fingerprinting keywords. To bridge this gap, we introduce Deep Keyword Fingerprinting (DKF), a novel approach that utilizes a large dataset, deep learning models, and adapted website fingerprinting features to significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting user-searched keywords. Additionally, we propose BurstGuard, an effective defense designed to disrupt keyword trace patterns and substantially defeat DKF, thereby improving upon state-of-the-art defense methods. Collectively, our study not only advances KF detection techniques but also strengthens defenses, significantly enhancing user privacy on Tor.}

	abstract = {Locally differentially private (LDP) graph analysis allows private analysis on a graph that is distributed across multiple users. However, such computations are vulnerable to poisoning attacks where an adversary can skew the results by submitting malformed data. In this paper, we formally study the impact of poisoning attacks for graph degree estimation protocols under LDP and make three key contributions. First, we show that existing LDP protocols are highly susceptible to poisoning. To address this, we propose novel robust protocols that exploit the natural redundancy in graphs—each edge is shared between two users—to ensure accurate degree estimation even under poisoning. Our protocols are more robust when the adversary is restricted to manipulating their inputs rather than their (noisy) responses. Second, we prove matching lower bounds, establishing that our protocols achieve optimal robustness against both input and response poisoning. These bounds also demonstrate a fundamental separation between the two attack models, consistent with observations from prior work. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world graphs across a range of practically motivated attacks, showing that our protocols are effective in practice.}

	abstract = {The advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is pivotal in the deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), offering significant improvements in road safety and traffic management. Current systems predominantly utilize pseudonym-based approaches to address privacy concerns; however, these systems confront several limitations, including reliance on centralized authorization authorities and insufficient support for practical scenarios where there is a need to disclose certain necessary attributes. In this paper, we introduce PSP, a novel privacy-preserving, self-certify pseudonym protocol explicitly designed for V2X networks that support selective disclosure. PSP employs an anonymous credential framework, facilitating decentralized pseudonym generation and eliminating dependence on central authorities. This innovative approach (1) supports decentralized pseudonym generation and binding, eliminating the reliance on a centralized Authorization Authority. (2) restricts vehicles to binding only one pseudonym with their long-term credential per epoch, thereby thwarting Sybil attacks; (3) enables vehicles to selectively disclose the necessary attributes while safeguarding credential privacy; and (4) incorporates credential tracing and revocation mechanisms to ensure accountability for malicious activities. We substantiate our contributions with formal security analysis and demonstrate the practicality of PSP through implementation, achieving efficient proof generation and verification times suitable for real-time ITS applications.}

	abstract = {As cloud-based quantum computing services, such as those offered by D-Wave, become more popular for practical applications, privacy-preserving methods (such as obfuscation) are essential to address data security, privacy, and legal compliance concerns. Several efficient obfuscation methods have been proposed, which do not increase the time complexity of solving the obfuscated problem, for quantum optimization problems. These include  sign reversing ,  variable permutation , and the combination of both methods assumed to provide greater protection. Unfortunately, sign reversing has already been shown to be insecure. We present two attacks on variable permutation and the combined method that efficiently recover the deobfuscated problem and its solution, particularly when given access to the obfuscated problem and its obfuscated solution, as a cloud-based quantum provider would. Our attacks are in the context of an optimization problem of cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher family, but our approach generalizes to other similarly structured problems. Our attacks are efficient and practical. Deobfuscating an optimization problem with  n  variables obfuscated with the combined method has a complexity of  O ( n 2 ) compared to the complexity of  O ( n  ·  n ! · 2 n ) of the brute force attack. We provide an implementation of our attack; on a commodity laptop, our attack using the full Trivium cipher takes less than two minutes when optimized. We also present possible countermeasures to mitigate our attacks and bring attention to the need for further development in this area.}

	abstract = {The QUIC protocol is now widely adopted by major tech companies and accounts for a significant fraction of today’s Internet traffic. QUIC’s multiplexing capabilities, encrypted headers, dynamic IP address changes, and encrypted parameter negotiations make the protocol not only more efficient, secure, and censorship-resistant, but also practically unmanageable by firewalls. This opens up doors for attackers that may exploit certain traits of the QUIC protocol to perform targeted attacks, such as data exfiltration attacks. Whereas existing data exfiltration techniques, such as TLS and DNS-based exfiltration, can be detected on a firewall level, QUIC-based data exfiltration is more difficult to detect, since changes in IP addresses and ports are inherent to the protocol’s normal behaviour. To show the feasibility of a QUIC-based data exfiltration attack, we first introduce a novel method which leverages the server preferred address feature of the QUIC protocol and, thus, allows an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from an infected machine to a malicious server, disguised as a server-side connection migration. The attack is implemented in the form of a proof of concept tool in Rust. We evaluated the performance of five anomaly detection classifiers — Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest — trained on datasets collected from three distinct network traffic scenarios. The classifiers were trained on ∼ \xa0700K benign and malicious QUIC packets and 786 connection migration events, but were unable to effectively detect the data exfiltration attempts. Furthermore, post-analysis of the traffic captures did not reveal any identifiable fingerprint. As part of our evaluation, we also interviewed five leading firewall vendors and found that, as of today, no major firewall vendor implements functionality capable of distinguishing between benign and malicious QUIC connection migrations.}

	abstract = {Voice deepfake attacks, which artificially impersonate human speech for malicious purposes, have emerged as a severe threat. Existing defenses typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness is diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To overcome these limitations, we propose  ClearMask , a noise-free defense mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches,  ClearMask  modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop  ClearMask , named  LiveMask , to protect streaming speech in real-time through universal frequency filter and reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that  ClearMask  and  LiveMask  effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models and black-box API services. Furthermore,  ClearMask  demonstrates resilience against adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal from the protected speech samples.}

	abstract = {Wearables are widely used for health data collection due to their availability and advanced sensors, enabling smart health applications like stress detection. However, the sensitivity of personal health data raises significant privacy concerns. While user de-identification by removing direct identifiers such as names and addresses is commonly employed to protect privacy, the data itself can still be exploited to re-identify individuals. We introduce a novel framework for similarity-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) re-identification attacks on time series health data. Using the WESAD dataset and two larger synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that even short segments of sensor data can achieve perfect re-identification with our Slicing-DTW-Attack. Our attack is independent of training data and computes similarity rankings in about 2 minutes for 10,000 subjects on a single CPU core. These findings highlight that de-identification alone is insufficient to protect privacy. As a defense, we show that adding random noise to the signals significantly reduces re-identification risk while only moderately affecting usability in stress detection tasks, offering a promising approach to balancing privacy and utility.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a secure steganographic method based on chaos-aided quantization index modulation (QIM). By integrating chaotic dynamics with lattice-based quantization, the proposed scheme enhances security while preserving the statistical properties of the cover signal. A chaotic system generates a pseudorandom sequence, which is transformed into a uniform distribution via modulo lattice operations. This sequence then serves as a dither signal in the QIM embedding process, ensuring that the stego signals remain indistinguishable from the original. We provide formal proof of statistical indistinguishability. Theoretical and experimental results confirm that the chaos-aided QIM approach resists statistical detection while maintaining high embedding efficiency. The method is particularly suited for applications requiring undetectable covert communication.}

Modded apps are typically available in third-party app markets and enable premium features without payment of a fee, game cheats, modified or removed ads, etc. Users are enticed by the modded features to install unsafe outdated versions of popular apps\xa0[ 29 ]. We present the results of the first survey-based study of 14 Android and 5 iOS modded app market operators and the effect of modded apps on 717 original app developers. We find modded market operators have economic incentives to break copyright law and make it difficult to file complaints. They perform little to no security testing of the apps they host. We updated our ModZoo dataset\xa0[ 29 ] and sent 27k affected app developers a personalised digest of the analysis results. We find modded markets benefit from the original app developers’ intellectual property while affected developers incur revenue losses from purchases, advertising, increased server calls, etc. and negative impacts from increased errors, support requests and reputation damage. We also study DMCA compliance of the top 23 modded app markets and confirm our survey findings: DMCA copyright claims are unusable at scale. Finally, we propose possible solutions to the modding problem.}

	abstract = {Iran expends significant effort to block circumvention tools. This paper offers a unique view into the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between censors and circumventors in practice. We provide evidence of how Iran blocks certain components of our proxy system to discourage use. While prior work has suggested Iran’s censorship is centrally managed, our experience suggests this may be an incomplete view: we observe censorship can vary dramatically across Iran’s major ISPs both in the technique and timing of blocking, suggesting there may be ISP-specific deployments or configurations in use. Our work reveals both the utility and shortcomings of measuring censorship from the circumventor’s perspective. Prior work has struggled to measure censorship in locations similar to Iran, due to the difficulty of obtaining vantage points, particularly in mobile or residential networks that serve most users. Our data reflects a type of ground-truth in this regard: the scale of our measurements reveals the type of network interference real users in Iran face in their everyday use. Nonetheless, our perspective is also limited: passive measurements of aggregate user traffic can be noisy, leaving us with a narrow view of how censorship works or evolves. Our goal with this work is to augment prior techniques, providing yet another tool for researchers in the effort to support Internet freedom in Iran and globally.}

	abstract = {Doctolib is a popular healthcare platform, used by over 90 million users across France, Italy, and Germany. One of its main features is the secure data exchange between patients and doctors, with 7\xa0million documents shared per month. Doctolib claims to provide the "world’s first end-to-end encryption platform built for health applications". The encryption protocol, described in a Whitepaper and Github repository, relies on envelope encryption and lets users upload ciphertexts for the secure data exchange. The ciphertexts are stored and retrieved through a distributed system, consisting of a data server and a key server. To access the data, recipients fetch the ciphertexts and decrypt them with their private key. However, the platform does not require end-users to maintain any cryptographic keys themselves and instead relies on a  virtual device  that leverages the two-server setting. The virtual device splits the user’s private key over both servers, and uses password-based authentication for its retrieval. Overall, the goal of the protocol is to ensure confidentiality of the uploaded medical records as long as at most one server is corrupt. In this work, we analyze the security of Doctolib’s distributed encryption protocol. First, we define a set of formal security models for such  password-based distributed envelope encryption , that capture the optimal security properties under different corruption settings. We then analyze the protocol – abstracted from the available information – in our model, and show that it does not achieve the desired security guarantees. We finally propose a simple modification that strengthens the original protocol through the use of a distributed oblivious pseudorandom function that provably achieves all our security properties.}

	abstract = {Tabular data sharing serves as a common method for data exchange. However, sharing sensitive information without adequate privacy protection can compromise individual privacy. Thus, ensuring privacy-preserving data sharing is crucial. Differential privacy (DP) is regarded as the gold standard in data privacy. Despite this, current DP methods tend to generate privacy-preserving tabular datasets that often suffer from limited practical utility due to heavy perturbation and disregard for the tables’ utility dynamics. Besides, there has not been much research on selective attribute release, particularly in the context of controlled, partially perturbed data sharing. This has significant implications for scenarios such as cross-agency data sharing in real-world situations. We introduce OptimShare, a utility-focused, multi-criteria solution designed to selectively perturb input datasets, optimized for specific real-world applications. OptimShare combines the principles of DP, fuzzy logic, and probability theory to establish an integrated tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. Empirical assessments confirm that OptimShare successfully strikes a balance between better data utility and robust privacy, effectively serving various real-world use cases.}

These applications are heavily used on modern blockchain platforms. This paper presents the so far most efficient direct construction and implementation of a non-interactive distributed verifiable random function (NI-DVRF) that is fully compatible with Ethereum. Our NI-DVRF scheme adopts pairings and combines techniques from secret sharing, SNARKs, and BLS signatures. The security properties of the resulting NI-DVRF scheme are formally modelled and proven in the random oracle model under standard pairing-based assumptions. To justify the efficiency and cost claims and more generally its adoption potential in practice, the proposed NI-DVRF scheme was implemented in Rust and Solidity. Our implementation is highly optimised and is currently being investigated for deployment on the multichain layer-2 scaling solution provided by Boba Network to power its DRB service zkRand. Our experimental analysis, therefore, also evaluates performance and scalability properties of the proposed NI-DVRF and its implementation.}

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge range arguments are a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to convince a verifier of the knowledge of a secret value lying within a predefined range. They have been utilized in diverse applications, such as confidential transactions. Range arguments with a transparent setup dispense with any trusted setup to eliminate security backdoor and enhance transparency. They are increasingly deployed in diverse decentralized applications on blockchains. One of the major concerns of practical deployment of range arguments on blockchains is the incurred gas cost and high computational overhead associated with blockchain miners. Hence, it is crucial to optimize the  verification efficiency  in range arguments to alleviate the deployment cost on blockchains and other decentralized platforms. In this paper, we present  VeRange  with several new zero-knowledge range arguments in the discrete logarithm setting, requiring only  c N / log \u2061 N  group exponentiations for verification, where  N  is the number of bits to represent a range and  c  is a small constant, making them concretely efficient for blockchain deployment with a very low gas cost. Furthermore,  VeRange  is aggregable, allowing a prover to simultaneously prove  T  range arguments in a single argument, requiring only  O ( T N / log \u2061 ( T N ) ) + T  group exponentiations for verification. We deployed  VeRange  on Ethereum, achieving the fastest verification runtime and the lowest gas cost among the discrete-logarithm-based range arguments in practice.}

	abstract = {Time-Lock Puzzles (TLPs) enable a client to lock a message such that a server can unlock it only after a specified time. They have diverse applications, such as scheduled payments, secret sharing, and zero-knowledge proofs. In this work, we present a scalable TLP designed for real-world scenarios involving a large number of puzzles, where clients or servers may lack the computational resources to handle high workloads. Our contributions are both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical standpoint, we formally define the concept of a “Delegated Time-Lock Puzzle (D-TLP)”, establish its fundamental properties, and introduce an  upper bound  for TLPs, addressing a previously overlooked aspect. From a practical standpoint, we introduce the “Efficient Delegated Time-Lock Puzzle” (ED-TLP) protocol, which implements the D-TLP concept. This protocol enables both the client and server to  securely outsource  their resource-intensive tasks to third-party helpers. It enables  real-time verification  of solutions and guarantees their delivery within predefined time limits by integrating an upper bound and a fair payment algorithm. ED-TLP allows combining puzzles from different clients, enabling a solver to process them sequentially, significantly reducing computational resources, especially for a large number of puzzles or clients. ED-TLP is the first protocol of its kind. We have implemented ED-TLP and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its performance for up to 10,000 puzzles. The results highlight its significant efficiency in TLP applications, demonstrating that ED-TLP securely delegates 99% of the client’s workload and 100% of the server’s workload with minimal overhead.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic wallets are an essential tool to securely store and maintain users’ secret keys and consequently their funds in Blockchain networks. A compelling approach to construct such wallets is to share the user’s secret key among several devices, such that an adversary must corrupt multiple machines to extract the entire secret key. Indeed, many leading cryptocurrency companies such as Coinbase, Binance, or ZenGo have started offering such distributed wallets to their customers. An important feature of a cryptographic wallet is its compatibility with the so-called BIP32 specification, the most widely adopted standard for cryptographic wallets. Essentially, BIP32 specifies the notion of a hierarchical deterministic wallet, which allows to create a key hierarchy in a deterministic fashion. Unfortunately, despite significant interest, no practically efficiently solution for a fully distributed wallet scheme, that also follows the BIP32 standard, exists. In this work, we show the first  concretely efficient  construction of a fully distributed wallet that is compliant with the BIP32 standard. To this end, we first provide a game-based notion of threshold signatures with rerandomizable keys and show an instantiation via the Gennaro and Goldfeder threshold ECDSA scheme (CCS’18). We then observe that one of BIP32’s key derivation mechanisms, the so-called hardened derivation, cannot efficiently be translated to the threshold setting. Instead, we devise a novel and efficient hardened derivation mechanism for the threshold setting that satisfies the same properties as the original mechanism as specified by BIP32. As a final contribution, we evaluate our solution with respect to its running time and communication cost.}

	abstract = {Owing to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, there has been widespread adoption of traditional financial applications such as lending, borrowing, margin trading, and more, into the cryptocurrency realm. In some cases, the inherently transparent and unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies exposes users of these applications to attacks. One such attack is  frontrunning , where a malicious entity leverages the knowledge of currently unprocessed financial transactions and attempts to get its own transaction(s) executed ahead of the unprocessed ones. The consequences of this can be financial loss, inaccurate transactions, and even exposure to more attacks. We propose FIRST, a framework that prevents frontrunning, and as a secondary effect, also backrunning and sandwich attacks. FIRST is built using cryptographic protocols including verifiable delay functions and aggregate signatures. We formally prove the security of FIRST using the universal composability framework, and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchain data. We show that with FIRST, the probability of frontrunning is approximately 0.00004 (or 0.004%) on Ethereum and 0% on Binance Smart Chain, making it effectively near zero.}

	abstract = {Mining attacks remain a serious threat to Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain systems, as malicious miners can deviate from standard mining rules to gain extra rewards. While classic selfish mining tactics conceal entire blocks or release them at once to cause forks, we extend the strategy space by introducing  partial block sharing  and leveraging  zero-knowledge proofs . Specifically, we propose a novel  Mining Attack with Zero Knowledge , encompassing two main strategies:  Partial Selfish Mining (PSM)  and its advanced variant  Advanced PSM (A-PSM) . By selectively releasing only partial block data, an attacker can attract  rational miners  to join its private branch without fully revealing the mined block. A zero-knowledge-proof-based mechanism ensures that these rational miners can be convinced of the block’s validity without learning its complete content, thereby incentivizing them to collude for higher individual gains. Our theoretical and experimental results show that, under certain conditions on mining power distribution and network latency, PSM can yield higher rewards than both honest and selfish mining, and A-PSM attackers can achieve profits that match or exceed selfish mining and even honest mining. This work highlights a novel  zero-knowledge-enabled  collusion threat in blockchain mining and calls for broader security measures to protect against such sophisticated strategies.}

	abstract = {Pooled mining in Bitcoin lets participants share costs and combine computational power, so each miner receives steadier payouts proportional to their contributed work. However, several recent attacks, such as Fork After Withholding (FAW), Power Adjusting Withholding (PAW), and Fork Withholding Attack under a Protection Racket (FWAP), have demonstrated that attackers can exploit open pools to deviate from honest mining and gain more rewards. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack called  Infiltrated Selfish Mining (ISM)  attack, enabling attackers to earn a higher reward than FAW under certain circumstances,  while remaining easier to execute than both PAW and FWAP .  By infiltrating a pool and withholding found block, an ISM attacker can generate not only an intentional fork but also a rivalless secret block that stays one block ahead of the public chain.  To our best knowledge, ISM is the first pooled mining attack that is capable of avoiding the “miner’s dilemma” without suffering a loss in a game  when two or more pools  attack against each other, and providing the corresponding theoretical winning conditions.  Our formal analysis proves that ISM can produce a win-win outcome for all attacking pools in ISM games, in contrast to previous attacks, which operate as pool-size games benefitting only larger pools.  The win-win thinking of ISM makes it more attractive to attackers, and therefore more harmful. We also propose a reward approach integrated with a new punishment solution as a potential countermeasure against ISM.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce and implement  BRC20 snipping attack . Our attack manipulates the BRC20 token transfers in open markets and disrupts the fairness among bidding participants. The long-standing principle of "highest bidder wins" is rendered ineffective. Typically, open BRC20 token markets rely on Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) to broadcast selling intents and wait for buying auctions. Our attack targets the BRC20 buying process (i.e., transfer) by injecting a front-running transaction to complete the full signature of the PSBT. At its core, the attack exploits the mempool’s fee-based transaction selection mechanism to snipe the victim transaction, replicate metadata, and front-run the legesmate transaction. This attack applies to platforms using PSBT for BRC20 token transfers, including popular Bitcoin exchanges and marketplaces (e.g., Magic Eden, Unisat, Gate.io, and OKX). We implemented and tested the attack on a Bitcoin testnet (regtest), validating its effectiveness through multiple experimental rounds. Results show that the attacker consistently replaces legitimate transactions by submitting higher-fee PSBTs. We have also made responsible disclosures to the mentioned exchanges.}

We collected the datasets of 543,576 cross-chain transactions from four bridges, along with 1,076,972 related transactions from 11 blockchains in 2023. Using the datasets, we conducted an in-depth analysis of cross-chain transactions, focusing on their basic characteristics and costs. We also identified inconsistencies between bridge and blockchain data and performed a cluster analysis to uncover activities in cross-chain transactions. Our findings revealed 308 transactions with ledger inconsistencies that could potentially lead to asset losses. We identified four types of cross-chain activities, including 11 arbitrage bots that earned over $267k in profits within 10 months, and a liquidity pool attack that caused more than $570k in losses and led to a two-month suspension of bridge services. We tracked 24 known malicious addresses involved in cross-chain bridge activities and found 82 related transactions used for transferring illicit funds. Additionally, we uncovered six previously unreported malicious addresses.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing frameworks allow the detection of code bugs or errors by feeding the code with unconventional inputs. Recently, Ma et al. proposed LOKI (NDSS, 2023), the first fuzzing framework tailored to blockchain consensus protocols\xa0[ 1 ]. LOKI uses high-frequency messages to model the dynamics of consensus algorithms. However, low-frequency messages are fundamental to the consensus’s state evolution. Thus, neglecting them hinders the in-depth exploration of vulnerabilities, leading to missed bugs or critical issues generated by low-frequency messages. In this paper, we propose  messAge-aWare hybrid markOved StatE model (AWOSE) , a fuzzing framework modeling high and low-frequency messages to uncover vulnerabilities and bugs in consensus algorithms. AWOSE leverages Markov Chains (MCs) to model the general states of the consensus messages while leveraging Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model latent or hidden state transitions based on code mutations (as in LOKI) or external factors (e.g., malicious inputs). Such probabilistic state models are beneficial for capturing the uncertain nature of system behaviors, enabling a more realistic and flexible representation of consensus dynamics. AWOSE is the first model to introduce the message context-based state model generation for fuzzing purposes. Via a thorough evaluation, we compare AWOSE with LOKI. Results show that our proposed AWOSE provides  48.3 %  more accurate states and  83.2 %  better path coverage. Thanks to AWOSE we were able to uncover new bugs that LOKI did not detect. Our experiments lead to the identification of previously unknown vulnerabilities, currently being evaluated as CVEs.}

	abstract = {We propose Data Tumbling Layer (DTL), a cryptographic scheme for non-interactive data tumbling. The core concept is to enable users to  commit  to specific data and subsequently  re-use  the encrypted version of these data across different applications while removing the link to the previous data commit action. We define the following security and privacy notions for DTL: (i)  no one-more redemption : a malicious user cannot redeem and use the same data more than the number of times they have committed the data; (ii)  theft prevention : a malicious user cannot use data that has not been committed by them; (iii)  non-slanderabilty : a malicious user cannot prevent an honest user from using their previously committed data; and (iv)  unlinkability : a malicious user cannot link tainted data from an honest user to the corresponding data after it has been tumbled. To showcase the practicality of DTL, we use DTL to realize applications for (a) unlinkable fixed-amount payments; (b) unlinkable and confidential payments for variable amounts; (c) unlinkable weighted voting protocol. Finally, we implemented and evaluated all the proposed applications. For the unlinkable and confidential payment application, a user can initiate such a transaction in less than 1.5 s  on a personal laptop. In terms of on-chain verification, the gas cost is less than 1.8 million.}

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency exchanges serve as critical infrastructure within the blockchain ecosystem, providing traders with accessible platforms for exchanging cryptocurrencies across a vast blockchain network. Atomic swap represents a promising underlying protocol for currency exchanges, ensuring secure currency swaps for traders. However, most existing atomic swap solutions fail to consider user privacy, with only a few achieving privacy preservation under specific constraints (e.g., only supporting anonymous blockchains or relying on the stable price assumption). These constraints limit their applicability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. To remove these constraints, we present  Pace , a novel privacy-preserving atomic swap protocol that supports public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Pace  also maintains the balance security of both honest platforms and traders while removing the stable price assumption, thereby enhancing its applicability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. To enhance user privacy, we propose a 1-to-1 swap protocol that integrates mixers as relays, ensuring all transfers within the swap achieve unlinkability. To avoid atomicity issues arising from an increase in transfers, we propose the combinable and randomizable puzzle, an extension of existing randomizable puzzles that enables atomic execution for multiple transfers with different puzzles. In addition, we extend 1-to-1 swap protocol to 1-to- n  swap protocol to achieve flexible exchange rate settings, thereby removing the stable price assumption. We then provide a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that, even if the platform and another user are malicious, the unlinkability of the honest user’ cross-chain addresses is still guaranteed. Finally, we implement a prototype of  Pace  and validate its practicality.}

In this paper, we propose NoBU, a novel, efficient, and effective solution to counter this threat that leverages information contextual to the physical space surrounding the targeted asset. NoBU captures vibrations from keystrokes and correlates them with input signals to distinguish between legitimate, human-generated inputs, and fake ones—blocking the latter. We evaluated our solution across various environments and keyboard types, demonstrating NoBU’s promising capabilities. A preliminary version of NoBU, which constitutes the core of our proposal, achieves an accuracy of 99.92%, scoring 99.83% on precision and a recall of 100% in identifying malicious keystrokes; hence, the system does not accept false negatives. We further enhanced our detection methodology, moving from continuous input validation to seamless keyboard enrollment, still leveraging the basic idea introduced by NoBU. The new proposal (eNoBU), achieves a staggering accuracy of 100%, while improving the user experience and further reducing the system overhead. These results suggest that eNoBU, leveraging the cyber-physical properties that naturally arise from human-computer interactions, is a potential candidate for a definitive solution to the BadUSB threat.}

	abstract = {Mitigating damages due to a cyber attack in industrial plants relies upon timely triage of early physical process symptoms. This aims to  connect  process symptoms to a potential control host intrusion. Unfortunately, due to the semantic gap between host and process behavior, operators must manually and painstakingly iterate between diverse control host and process forensic logs. This slows down their response, is error-prone, and may lead to further damage. We present  PhyLink , a post-mortem technique to automatically connect process symptoms to control host intrusion, allowing operators to respond to  confirmed  attacks and stop damages.  PhyLink  uses physical evidence (e.g., device symptom location) to guide a symbolic binary exploration of the control host execution context (from memory snapshots). Learning from past control host attacks,  PhyLink  develops a generic approach to not only link host intrusion vectors to process symptoms, but  ranks  them by their likelihood to cause damages. This helps operators prioritize their response (e.g., which symptoms to respond to). Using 1219 real-world control host snapshots, we evaluated  PhyLink  against past attacks, and adaptive attacks to evade  PhyLink . We show that  PhyLink  is robust in triaging control host-originated process attacks.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in vulnerabilities, with traditional metrics like CVSS and PoC exploits failing to fully explain exploitation patterns. To address this, we leverage features from the-state-of-the-art prediction model EPSS – such as CVSS, CWE, vendors, external references, vulnerability age, and PoCs – and combine it with new features derived from hacking communities. Our study of 23,373 IoT-related CVEs and 25k posts from 25 hacking forums highlights the importance of including insights on attacker behavior from discussions involving vulnerabilities. We identified 38 features with a  p -value < 0.05 that impact attackers’ selection of IoT vulnerabilities. We use two metrics to evaluate our model with features from hacking forums: McFadden’s pseudo  R 2 , which showed a 21% improvement in explaining variance, and the Brier score for prediction accuracy, with a 17% improvement over EPSS. These results emphasize that current state-of-the-art methods struggle to capture the distinct nuances and complexity of IoT threats, and incorporating available information such as insights into attacker behavior can enhance the factors influencing the targeting of IoT vulnerability better.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is permeating many aspects of everyday life, including homes, public spaces, and industrial settings. The growing popularity of IoT devices prompts an important challenge of ensuring secure and reliable communication. To support direct device-to-device communication among resource-constrained IoT devices, lightweight authentication techniques are needed that do not rely on trusted servers. One promising primitive for this purpose are Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), which utilize unique characteristics of hardware components (e.g., memory) inherent in the manufacturing of IoT devices. Given some input, a PUF generates a unique secret value which facilitates secure and robust authentication. However, current PUF-based authentication schemes require a trusted server, incur substantial computational costs, or lack resilience against emerging quantum computing threats. This paper introduces AuthentiSafe, a lightweight, scalable, and secure PUF-based authentication scheme for device-to-device authentication among mutually mistrusting IoT devices. AuthentiSafe integrates PUFs with one-time signatures and cryptographic accumulators, thus eliminating the need for a trusted server. By relying exclusively on efficient cryptographic one-way hash functions, AuthentiSafe minimizes protocol costs and accommodates low computational power and very limited secure storage of IoT devices. It also ensures security in the post-quantum era, since one-way functions remain resilient to quantum attacks. We show AuthentiSafe’s resilience against various attacks. Experiments show that it appreciably outperforms three prior PUF-based authentication schemes.}

	abstract = {Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technology for maintaining desired speed and safe distance to the leading vehicle. This paper evaluates the security of the deep neural network (DNN) based ACC systems under runtime stealthy perception attacks that strategically inject perturbations into camera data to cause forward collisions. We present a context-aware strategy for the selection of the most critical times for triggering the attacks and a novel optimization-based method for the adaptive generation of image perturbations at runtime. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attack using an actual vehicle, a publicly available driving dataset, and a realistic simulation platform with the control software from a production ACC system, a physical-world driving simulator, and interventions by the human driver and safety features such as Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). Experimental results show that the proposed attack achieves 142.9 times higher success rate in causing hazards and 82.6% higher evasion rate than baselines, while being stealthy and robust to real-world factors and dynamic changes in the environment. This study highlights the role of human drivers and basic safety mechanisms in preventing attacks.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed significant security vulnerabilities in LiDAR-based object detection systems, focusing mainly on attacks against machine learning (ML)-based object detection methods. However, these attacks often overlook the simpler, density-based object detection methods commonly used alongside ML models in autonomous vehicles, which are generally resistant to ML-targeted attacks. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Adversarial Fog Attack (AFA), a novel attack framework that exploits vulnerabilities in both ML- and density-based object detection methods by targeting the point cloud preprocessing stage. AFA leverages artificially generated, strategically configured fog layers to cause objects to become undetectable to LiDAR systems. We develop a theoretical framework modeling LiDAR signal behavior in foggy conditions and analyze point cloud filtering algorithms to determine optimal fog configurations. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AFA, achieving a 100% success rate using a six-layer fog configuration, with target vehicles colliding with obstacles at an average speed of 37.1\xa0km/h with almost no deceleration. Our physical experiments confirm that neither the fog nor the target objects are detectable at a distance of 30\xa0m, aligning with our simulation results. We also propose potential countermeasures, including noise removal rate-based detection and thermal camera integration.}

	abstract = {In a modern automobile, the in-vehicle communication network interconnects multiple subsystems, including those that perform safety-critical functions such as engine control, anti-lock braking, and airbag deployment, among many others. Therefore, the loss of data integrity in the network can have serious consequences for the safety of the vehicle. To that extent, CAN protocol, the most common in-vehicle communication standard, employs error-handling mechanisms such as bit-monitoring and cyclic-redundancy check to detect intentional or unintentional data manipulation. In this work, we exploit the transmission line nature of the CAN physical layer (a twisted pair cable) to induce voltage transients that result in bit manipulations. Specifically, we demonstrate bidirectional bit flip attacks, recessive to dominant (R → D) and dominant to recessive (D → R) with the aid of multiple compromised nodes (electronic control units) in the network. In addition, both the attacks, the simpler R → D, and the complex D → R are designed to be undetectable to the aforementioned error-handling mechanisms. The attacks become effective for distances ≥ 4\u2009m for D → R and ≥ 1\u2009m for R → D between the transmitter and receiver nodes. By demonstrating these bit flips, we challenge two fundamental physical layer assumptions of CAN: the impossibility of turning a dominant bit to recessive without an external current source, and having nonidentical signals on two nodes at the same time. The theory behind the attacks is presented, backed by circuit simulations, in-lab validations, and real-world demonstrations in a vehicle. These bit-level attacks, designed at the physical layer, circumvent software-based CAN defenses and lay the groundwork for a broader spectrum of potential attacks, including the manipulation of a data frame that we demonstrate.}

	abstract = {Radio Frequency fingerprinting enables a passive receiver to recognize and authenticate a transmitter without the need for cryptographic tools. Authentication is achieved by isolating specific features of the transmitted signal that are unique to the transmitter’s hardware. Much research has focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of radio frequency fingerprinting to maximize its performance in various scenarios and conditions, while little research examined how to protect devices from being subject to radio fingerprinting in the wild. In this paper, we explore a novel point of view. We examine the threat posed by radio frequency fingerprinting, which facilitates the unauthorized identification of wireless devices in the field by malicious entities. We also suggest a method to sanitize the transmitted signal of its fingerprint using a low-power jammer, deployed on purpose to improve devices’ anonymity on the channel while still guaranteeing the link’s quality of service. Our experimental results and subsequent analysis demonstrate that a low-power jammer can effectively block a malicious eavesdropper from identifying a device without affecting the quality of the wireless link, thereby restoring the privacy of the user when accessing the radio spectrum.}

	abstract = {Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as a promising technology to interconnect different components of Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) and is preferred due to its high throughput and lower latency. Despite all its advantages, NoCs are vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Recently, researchers have demonstrated practical  time-driven cache attacks  and  access-driven cache attacks  namely Earthquake, PP-Arrow, and PP-Firework on NoC to retrieve secret keys of AES. Although  trace-driven cache attacks  are more powerful due to their simplicity and enhanced key entropy reduction capabilities, no such attack has been demonstrated so far for NoC architecture. The downside could be the fact that a) the attack setup overhead is high due to the requirement of an oscilloscope, b) unavailability of hardware performance counters (HPCs) of the secure zone in the NoC. In this work, we propose a novel method to monitor cache hit/miss in L1 (private) cache of AES core of the secure zone just by observing the  delay in throughput drop  of the adversarial packets on the NoC network. This completely eliminates the above-mentioned requirements. The proposed attack is able to reduce the key search space to 2 8  with the requirement of 256 traces only.}

	abstract = {Device fingerprinting leverages attributes that capture heterogeneity in hardware and software configurations to extract unique and stable fingerprints. Fingerprinting countermeasures attempt to either present a uniform fingerprint across different devices through normalization or present different fingerprints for the same device each time through obfuscation. We present FP-Rowhammer, a Rowhammer-based device fingerprinting approach that can build unique and stable fingerprints even across devices with normalized or obfuscated hardware and software configurations. To this end, FP-Rowhammer leverages the DRAM manufacturing process variation that gives rise to unique distributions of Rowhammer-induced bit flips across different DRAM modules. Our evaluation on a test bed of 98 DRAM modules shows that FP-Rowhammer achieves 99.91% fingerprinting accuracy. FP-Rowhammer’s fingerprints are also stable, with no degradation in fingerprinting accuracy over a period of ten days. We also demonstrate that FP-Rowhammer is efficient, taking less than five seconds to extract a fingerprint. FP-Rowhammer is the first Rowhammer fingerprinting approach to extract unique and stable fingerprints efficiently and at scale.}

	abstract = {Electromagnetic side-channel analysis is a powerful method for monitoring processor activity and compromising cryptographic systems in air-gapped environments. As analytical methodologies and target devices evolve, the importance of leakage localization and probe aiming becomes increasingly apparent for capturing only the desired signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Despite its importance, there remains substantial reliance on unreliable heuristic approaches and inefficient exhaustive searches. Furthermore, related studies often fall short in terms of feasibility, practicality, and performance, and are limited to controlled DUTs and low-end MCUs. To address the limitations and inefficiencies of the previous approaches, we propose a novel methodology— ProbeShooter —for leakage localization and probe aiming. This approach leverages new insights into the spatial characteristics of amplitude modulation and intermodulation distortion in processors. As a result,  ProbeShooter  provides substantial improvements in various aspects:  1)  it is applicable to not only simple MCUs but also complex SoCs,  2)  it effectively handles multi-core systems and dynamic frequency scaling,  3)  it is adoptable to uncontrollable DUTs, making it viable for constrained real-world attacks, and  4)  it performs significantly faster than previous methods. To demonstrate this, we experimentally evaluate  ProbeShooter  on a high-end MCU (the NXP i.MX RT1061 featuring a single ARM Cortex-M7 core) and a complex SoC (the Broadcom BCM2711 equipped with the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, featuring four ARM Cortex-A72 cores).}

	abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) are malicious circuits covertly embedded in hardware, similar to software backdoors, that can cause malfunctions or leak confidential information when activated. Detecting and localizing these HTs is critical, especially in sensitive systems like weaponry, where they pose significant security threats. Traditional detection methods often rely on side-channel analysis, which requires specialized equipment and expertise, making them costly and limited to post-manufacturing stages. Localization is crucial because merely detecting an HT does not allow for effective neutralization. Pinpointing the exact location helps in assessing the impact, facilitating targeted removal, and avoiding costly hardware redesigns. In critical applications like military systems, this minimizes the risk of security breaches that could compromise the entire system. This paper proposes a novel method for HT detection and localization using a Graph Autoencoder (GAE). Unlike existing techniques, our approach utilizes the structural information in Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) to identify HTs without the need for labeled datasets or manual feature engineering. By training solely on the Golden Model (GM) of the hardware design, the GAE captures the circuit’s normal structural patterns. Our method analyzes the reconstruction error of each node in the GAE to not only detect the presence of HTs but also accurately pinpoint their insertion points within the hardware design. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across various benchmarks, achieving high detection accuracy. It also offers practical advantages by avoiding the need for additional equipment or HT data during training, making it a feasible solution for early HT detection and mitigation in hardware systems.}

	abstract = {Most managed runtime environments abandoned attempts to mitigate speculative execution attacks between different trust domains within the same process (in-process), in favor of using process isolation to confine attackers. Indeed, many code-generation based mitigations focused on specific variants of speculative execution vulnerabilities. This makes design-level defenses with clear guarantees, such as process isolation, a more attractive solution, despite the challenges that may arise while adopting a multi-process architecture. We present  Monocle , a fundamental runtime code-generation approach that mitigates speculative execution attacks in-process.  Monocle  is based on software fault isolation (SFI) and can be validated at the machine code level to ensure all potential known Spectre gadgets are covered. Benchmarks show an overhead of only 20% over the baseline, on average, and an improvement of >4.1x when compared to using memory fences, a comprehensive baseline speculative execution barrier-based mitigation strategy.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces Okapi, a new hardware/software cross-layer architecture designed to mitigate Transient Execution Side Channel (TES) attacks, including Spectre variants, in modern computing systems. Okapi provides a hardware basis for secure speculation in sandboxed environments and can replace expensive speculation barriers in software. At its core, Okapi allows for speculative data accesses to a memory page only after the page has been accessed non-speculatively at least once by the current trust domain. The granularity of the trust domains can be controlled in software to achieve different security and performance trade-offs. For environments with less stringent security needs, Okapi’s features can be deactivated to remove all performance overhead. Without relying on any software modification, the Okapi hardware features already provide full protection against TES breakout attacks, e.g., by Spectre-PHT or Spectre-BTB, at a thread-level granularity. This incurs an average performance overhead of only 3.17\xa0% for the SPEC\xa0CPU2017 benchmark suite. Okapi introduces the  OkapiReset  instruction for additional soft-ware-level security support. This instruction allows for fine-grained sandboxing with custom program sizes smaller than a thread, resulting in 2.34\xa0% performance overhead in our WebAssembly runtime experiment. On top, Okapi provides the possibility to eliminate poisoning attacks. For the highest level of security, the  OkapiLoad  instruction prevents confidential data from being added to the trust domain after a sequential access, thereby enforcing  weak speculative non-interference . In addition, we present a hardware extension that limits the exploitable code space for Spectre gadgets to well-defined sections of the program. Therefore, by ensuring the absence of gadgets in these sections, developers can tailor their software towards achieving beneficial trade-offs between the size of a trust domain and performance.}

	abstract = {Rowhammer is a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized attackers to induce errors within DRAM cells, e.g., to attain elevated user privileges or to extract sensitive information from cryptographic schemes. To prevent fault injections from escalating to successful attacks, a widely accepted mitigation is implementing fault checks on instructions and data. We challenge the validity of this assumption by examining the impact of the fault on the victim’s functionality, as opposed to solely focusing on the victim’s erroneous output. Specifically, we illustrate that an attacker can construct a profile of the victim’s memory based on directional bit flip patterns. This profile is then utilized to identify the most susceptible bit locations within DRAM rows. These locations are then subsequently leveraged to deduce sensitive bit values during an online attack phase that exploits side information observed from the change in the victim’s behavior. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to utilize Rowhammer as a probe, shifting the emphasis away from the victim’s memory integrity and toward statistical fault analysis (SFA) based on the victim’s operational behavior. In the signing victim attack scenario, we show how  Fault + Probe  may be used to circumvent the verify-after-sign fault check mechanism, which is designed to prevent the generation of erroneous signatures that leak sensitive information. It does so by injecting directional faults into key positions identified during a memory profiling stage. The attacker observes the signature generation rate and decodes the secret bit value accordingly. This circumvention is enabled by an observable channel in the victim.  Fault + Probe  is not limited to signing victims and can be used to probe secret bits on arbitrary systems where an observable channel is present that leaks the result of the fault injection attempt. To demonstrate the attack, we target the fault-protected ECDSA in wolfSSL’s implementation of the TLS 1.3 handshake. We recover 256-bit session keys with an average recovery rate of 22 key bits/hour and a 100% success rate.}

	abstract = {Cars are increasingly integrated with digital technologies. Manufacturers aim to enhance the passenger experience by integrating onboard entertainment while minimizing driving effort. However, these advancements are enabled through more and more complex car computers. Tesla, a leader in this field, has actively promoted security research of their car computer by rewarding vulnerability disclosures and sponsoring security contests. However, they specifically exclude hardware attacks from these programs. This paper formalizes the assets of Tesla’s  Car Computer  specifically threatened by hardware attacks and outlines the security risks from various often overlooked stakeholders surrounding  Connected Cars . All three subsystems of the  Car Computer  can be fully compromised: two through low-cost voltage glitching attacks and one with a non-invasive, persistent electromagnetic fault injection attack, validating all identified risks. While these attack vectors are well-known in IT security research, our attacks enable important scrutiny of Tesla’s controversial driving assistance systems. Furthermore, the vulnerable components are either advertised for automotive use or even certified by automotive safety standards, making our attacks applicable to other car brands using the same chips. Finally, as effective countermeasures to fault injection attacks can be expected soon, this paper makes an important case for third-party access to  Connected Cars’  hardware, firmware, and data.}

	abstract = {Cache-based website fingerprinting attacks pose substantial privacy and security concerns. These attacks can unveil a user’s browsing behavior by monitoring cache activities without depending on network traces. However, existing studies that monitor the entire cache often generate noisy data and require large datasets. This study addresses the limitations of the aforementioned methods by introducing a novel cache-based website fingerprinting technique, called  AVXProbe , which leverages kernel-level information. In this attack, an attacker collects timing information from specific regions of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and cache within the address space of loaded kernel modules by measuring the access time of AVX masked operations. As AVX operations are commonly used on x86, our attack is effective on a broad range of modern Intel and AMD processors. The attacker employs machine learning techniques to identify the website visited by the victim. The evaluation results show that our attack achieves up to 97.7% accuracy on 100 websites. The attack is robust, achieving nearly 90% accuracy with 3.2 seconds of data collection time and 8 training data per website, while state-of-the-art attacks demonstrate about 44-70% accuracy under the same conditions. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the attack’s performance depends on combining multiple kernel module groups rather than a single module. Our attack highlights the potential of kernel-level side-channel information to enhance website fingerprinting attacks, posing new challenges to privacy and security in web browsing.}

	abstract = {The inherent sharing characteristic of branch predictors makes modern processors vulnerable to microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Among proposed mitigations, randomization-based countermeasures stand out for their practical potential, offering lower performance overhead compared to flushing or partitioning techniques. However, these randomized approaches often fail to guarantee absolute security, and existing evaluation methods cannot accurately quantify leakage in such designs. This underscores the urgent need for a formal methodology to systematically model and measure side-channel leakage in randomization-based secure branch predictors. In this paper, we propose a leakage quantification framework to measure side-channel leakage in these randomized countermeasures at the microarchitecture level. Our methodology incorporates detailed modeling of the operational principles and indexing/content randomization mechanisms of PHT and BTB components, effectively capturing timing characteristics relevant to microarchitectural attacks. Based on this, we define attack strategies and secret spaces that breach security boundaries, facilitating seamless integration of microarchitectural attacks with branch predictor models. We then present leakage evaluation metrics and assess the security of existing randomized defenses under various attack strategies and secret spaces, demonstrating our framework’s effectiveness in quantifying side-channel leakage. In particular, Our experiments reveal that reuse-based PHT attacks, prune-based BTB attacks and occupancy-based attacks remain significant threats, highlighting the need for stronger countermeasures.}

	abstract = {While traditional side-channel leakage assessment relies on physical measurements from fabricated hardware, pre-silicon leakage assessment – conducted through simulation – faces the challenge of estimating real-world leakage before hardware is available. Current pre-silicon methods seek to improve simulation accuracy by increasing the design detail at a single level of abstraction. However, there is always a limit to the level of detail that can be incorporated, leaving a gap between simulation and physical measurements. We show that side-channel leakage analysis can be approached as a top-down problem, using a hierarchical assessment across multiple abstraction levels in a design, enabling to gradually uncover sources of side-channel leakage. We introduce  Telescope , a top-down framework for pre-silicon side-channel leakage assessment across three abstraction levels:  architecture -,  micro-architecture -, and  gate -level.  Telescope ’s primary contribution is to demonstrate the propagation of leakage from software instructions to hardware implementation, revealing that leakage does not manifest uniformly across design levels. Through this cross-level analysis, we identify the origins of leakage at each abstraction level and explore their interdependencies. This analysis uncovers three distinct leakage patterns across levels:  progressive ,  emergent , and  disappearing  side-channel leakage. We demonstrate the scalability of  Telescope \xa0by applying it to two RISC-V processors: the multi-cycle PicoRV32 and the pipelined IBEX. We analyze their power-based side-channel leakage patterns across several benchmarks, and illustrate practical use cases in debugging of side-channel leakage issues, and verification of micro-architecture effects in side-channel leakage.}

	abstract = {Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim’s activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple’s M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.}

	abstract = {Besides rendering pages in common browsers like Chrome, it is customary for apps to rely on WebViews to display web pages. While browsers handle permissions through user prompts for each visited site, WebViews require developers to manage web permission requests individually, leaving significant room for error. However, to date, the community lacks insight into the current developers’ practices of WebView’s permission enforcement. To address this research gap, we present the first large-scale study on the implementation of WebView regarding web permission enforcement in the wild, focusing on Android apps. Particularly, we develop an automated pipeline to detect apps that utilize WebView to display websites to users but lack proper web permission enforcement, which we refer to as  privacy-harmful apps  (PHAs). Our pipeline flagged 12,109 potential PHAs that compromise user-sensitive data due to a failure to implement web permission enforcement. Among these potential PHAs, we further demonstrate how malicious apps without sensitive permissions can exploit 2,219 PHAs through a confused deputy attack to load targeted malicious websites that access sensitive data like location, camera, and microphone simply by starting these PHAs. Our results highlight a notable privacy risk – including apps with over 500 million installations – as any website can secretly collect user data while browsing online, and malicious apps can abuse such PHAs to collect user sensitive data at scale. To help developers, we notify affected developers and gather insights from their feedback. Our findings reveal widespread and often misunderstood issues, emphasizing the necessity of collaborative efforts among stakeholders to address these privacy concerns. Based on our insights, we further derive concrete recommendations for developers to mitigate privacy risks associated with WebView.}

	abstract = {The prevailing presence of DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on the Web poses a critical security threat to Internet surfers. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic detection and monitoring methods for XSS attacks, demonstrating their promising potential in mitigating security threats. However, this research direction suffers from a deployment issue, necessitating browser changes and significant refactoring to web applications, which hinders their practical deployment. To address these deployment challenges, we propose TrustyMon. The key idea is to leverage a new browser-integrated framework known as Trusted Types. We design TrustyMon to automatically collect benign signatures representing JavaScript (JS) snippets that implement website functionality. TrustyMon-protected webpages then match every JS code injected via XSS sinks among the benign JS signatures in runtime by leveraging Trusted Types in browsers. We demonstrate the efficacy of TrustyMon in accurately identifying DOM-based XSS attacks across 16 real-world web applications without false negatives. By leveraging Trusted Types, we improve the practical deployment of dynamic monitoring in client-side browsers without requiring any changes to browsers. TrustyMon introduces a negligible latency of 27.02 ms in page loading time during its deployment, exemplifying a practical and readily deployable monitoring framework for detecting DOM-based XSS attacks.}

	abstract = {The idea of progressive enhancement has been around for years and the Web platform is continuously enriched with new features. Nonetheless, it is the advent of service workers (SWs) and web app manifests (WAMs) that marked the era of capable, reliable, and installable progressive web applications (PWAs), following prior Web evolutions from a static medium to a dynamic platform. In this work, we introduce  ProwseBox , a comprehensive and efficient cross-browser and cross-platform framework for the dynamic, scalable and distributed measurement and analysis of PWAs, SWs – in the web apps, extensions, and Cloudflare workers – and web extensions. Leveraging the capabilities of the flexible, single-threaded, and event-driven JavaScript, and unique hacks to enable automated interactions with web push notifications or the file system API,  ProwseBox  produces detailed and structured datasets that researchers, browser vendors, web developers, and end users can apply modern data analysis techniques to, to uncover the evolution, state and (mal) practices on the usage of Web features, browser extensions and edge workers, or assess compliance with specifications, detect anomalies, bugs, vulnerabilities and data leakage. The framework has been extensively (re)engineered, documented, and thoroughly evaluated throughout the years, building on and adapting to the constant evolution of Web APIs. The collected dataset is well-structured and various analysis pipelines are provided for serializing and importing the data into state-of-the-art analysis frameworks like Apache Spark for processing. The framework has served or is currently serving to collect various large-scale data that support both measurement, security, and privacy studies, the most recent one covering 56,505,674 sites in the wild. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate a subset of the framework’s capabilities, ranging from the capture of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web apps and browser extensions, or the discovery of user-sensitive information leakage, etc. Ultimately, we hope to promote  ProwseBox  as the state-of-the-art tool for studying the progressive Web, much like ZDNS or OpenWPM that fosters replicability and major advances in other communities.}

	abstract = {Delegating authentication to identity providers like Google or Facebook, while convenient, compromises user privacy. These identity providers can record users’ every move; the global identifiers they provide also enable internet-wide tracking. We show that neither is a necessary evil by presenting the BISON pseudonym derivation protocol, inspired by Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions. It hides the service provider’s identity from the identity provider yet produces a trusted, scoped, immutable pseudonym. Colluding service providers cannot link BISON pseudonyms; this prevents user tracking. BISON does not require a long-lived state on the user device and does not add additional actors to the authentication process. BISON is practical. It is easy to understand, implement, and reason about, and is designed to integrate into existing authentication protocols. To demonstrate this, we provide an OpenID Connect extension that allows OIDC’s PPID pseudonyms to be derived using BISON while remaining fully backwards compatible. Additionally, BISON uses only lightweight cryptography. Pseudonym derivation requires a total of four elliptic curve scalar-point multiplications and four hash function evaluations, taking ≈ 3 ms in our proof of concept implementation. Thus, BISON’s privacy guarantees can be realized in practice. This makes BISON a crucial stepping stone towards the privacy-preserving internet of tomorrow.}

But what if the resources are encrypted? Should third parties get rights to decrypt them? We propose  APEX : an OAuth-grounded suite of protocols which systematically augment delegated authorisation to allow refined third-party access to encrypted resources, while maintaining OAuth’s behaviour for any unencrypted resources. We also provide an implementation of APEX, showing its seamless integration with OAuth. On the formal side, we propose a generalisation of APEX (and OAuth) into a paradigm which we call  restricted authorisation delegation (RAD) . RAD is a model that lifts formal treatment from protocol to suites; and, it also stipulates the desirable requirements that delegated authorisation schemes should attain (including to enable access over encrypted resources). We also give a formal, cryptographic model that augments existing models in multi-party authorisation, authenticated key-exchange and access control. Finally, we use this model to prove that APEX formally attains all the properties of a restricted authorisation delegation (RAD) scheme, and discuss that OAuth 2.0 does not.}

	abstract = {Content providers increasingly utilise Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to enhance users’ content download experience. However, this deployment scenario raises significant security concerns regarding content confidentiality and user privacy due to the involvement of third-party providers. Prior proposals using private information retrieval (PIR) and oblivious RAM (ORAM) have proven impractical due to high computation and communication costs, as well as integration challenges within distributed CDN architectures. In response, we present  OblivCDN , a practical privacy-preserving system meticulously designed for seamless integration with the existing real-world Internet-CDN infrastructure. Our design strategically adapts Range ORAM primitives to optimise memory and disk seeks when accessing contiguous blocks of CDN content, both at the origin and edge servers, while preserving both content confidentiality and user access pattern hiding features. Also, we carefully customise several oblivious building blocks that integrate the distributed trust model into the ORAM client, thereby eliminating the computational bottleneck in the origin server and reducing communication costs between the origin server and edge servers. Moreover, the newly-designed ORAM client also eliminates the need for trusted hardware on edge servers, and thus significantly ameliorates the compatibility towards networks with massive legacy devices. In real-world streaming evaluations,  OblivCDN  demonstrates remarkable performance, downloading a 256 MB video in just 5.6 seconds. This achievement represents a speedup of 90 × compared to a strawman approach (direct ORAM adoption) and a 366 × improvement over the prior art, OblivP2P.}

	abstract = {The pervasive growth of mobile devices has made them lucrative targets for various malware attacks. Despite numerous previous efforts on traffic-based malware detection, none of them offer a holistic approach to tackle the three challenges faced in online malware detection in 5G networks:  accuracy  (malware attacks can be detected at high accuracy),  scalability  (malware detection can be performed in a scalable manner for a large number of mobile users), and  integrality  (the malware defense system can be seamlessly integrated into the  5G network architecture ). We thus propose a new system called  O nline MAl ware D etection in 5G  Networks (OMAD5G) to defend against malware attacks in 5G networks. OMAD5G combines on-path malware detection, which is deployed by 5G User Plane Function usually handling large volumes of user traffic, and off-path malware detection, which is executed by separate servers with ample computational resources. We develop a lightweight classifier trained on Internet domain names for on-path malware detection, which is executed on P4 programmable switches, and apply  powerful transformer neural networks  on various packet features for off-path malware detection. OMAD5G uses tri-threshold learning based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion to facilitate toggling between on-path and off-path malware detection. The functionalities of OMAD5G are achieved with three 5G  service-based architecture (SBA) -compliant call flows to enable easy integration into existing 5G networks. We implement a prototype of OMAD5G and evaluate its performances using two realistic mobile traffic datasets induced by human operations. Our results show that OMAD5G achieves a detection rate of ∼ 95% and a false positive rate of ∼ 1% for both datasets, and its on-path detection module outperforms NetBeacon, a state-of-the-art in-network traffic classifier deployable on P4 programmable switches, on both detection accuracy and deployment scalability.}

	abstract = {Many Security Operations Centers (SOCs) today still heavily rely on signature-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) such as Suricata. The specificity of intrusion detection rules and the coverage provided by rulesets are common concerns within the professional community surrounding SOCs, which impact the effectiveness of automated alert post-processing approaches. We postulate a better understanding of factors influencing the quality of rules can help address current SOC issues. In this paper, we characterize the rules in use at a collaborating commercial (managed) SOC serving customers in sectors including education and IT management. During this process, we discover six relevant design principles, which we consolidate through interviews with experienced rule designers at the SOC. We then validate our design principles by quantitatively assessing their effect on rule specificity. We find that several of these design considerations significantly impact unnecessary workload caused by rules. For instance, rules that leverage proxies for detection, and rules that do not employ alert throttling or do not distinguish (un)successful malicious actions, cause significantly more workload for SOC analysts. Moreover, rules that match a generalized characteristic to detect malicious behavior, which is believed to increase coverage, also significantly increase workload, suggesting a tradeoff must be struck between rule specificity and coverage. We show that these design principles can be applied successfully at a SOC to reduce workload whilst maintaining coverage despite the prevalence of violations of the principles.}

	abstract = {Despite their widespread adoption, cellular networks face growing vulnerabilities due to their inherent complexity and the integration of advanced technologies. One of the major threats in this landscape is Voice over IP (VoIP) to GSM gateways, known as  SIMBox  devices. These devices use multiple SIM cards to route VoIP traffic through cellular networks, enabling international bypass fraud with losses of up to $3.11 billion annually. Beyond financial impact,  SIMBox  activity degrades network performance, threatens national security, and facilitates eavesdropping on communications. Existing detection methods for  SIMBox  activity are hindered by evolving fraud techniques and implementation complexities, limiting their practical adoption in operator networks. This paper addresses the limitations of current detection methods by introducing  SigN , a novel approach to identifying  SIMBox  activity at the cellular edge. The proposed method focuses on detecting  remote SIM card association , a technique used by  SIMBox  appliances to mimic human mobility patterns. The method detects latency anomalies between  SIMBox  and standard devices by analyzing cellular signaling during network attachment. Extensive indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that  SIMBox  devices generate significantly higher attachment latencies, particularly during the authentication phase, where latency is up to 23 times greater than that of standard devices. We attribute part of this overhead to immutable factors such as LTE authentication standards and Internet-based communication protocols. Therefore, our approach offers a robust, scalable, and practical solution to mitigate  SIMBox  activity risks at the network edge.}

	abstract = {We develop  QUICtester , an automated approach for uncovering non-compliant behaviors in the ratified QUIC protocol implementations (RFC 9000/9001).  QUICtester  leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing,  QUICtester  introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used  QUICtester  to analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the  five  security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.}

	abstract = {Modern networks increasingly rely on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to achieve flexibility and efficiency, which makes it more critical to ensure their security. Particularly, it is crucial to ensure the integrity of packets routing within the Network. In this paper, we address key security challenges within SDN architectures with a particular focus on the data plane. We explore these challenges through the lens of a security solution called SDNsec. We identify three fundamental security properties, namely payload integrity, route integrity and accountability. We define these security properties in the formal framework of the applied  Π  -Calculus. Likewise, we suggest two levels of route integrity: strong and weak, depending on the protocol’s requirements. We use ProVerif, a cryptographic protocol verifier, to conduct a formal analysis of the security of SDNsec. Thanks to our models, we discover several flaws on all the aforementioned properties. In response, we propose corrective measures to enhance SDNsec’s security. Moreover, to ensure that such attacks are feasible and that our improvements are effective, we implement and test SDNsec and our corrected solution using the RYU controller and Mininet network emulator.}

	abstract = {The long history of misconfigurations and errors in RPKI indicates that they cannot be easily avoided and will most probably persist also in the future. These errors create conflicts between BGP announcements and their covering ROAs, causing the RPKI validation to result in status  invalid . Networks that enforce RPKI filtering with Route Origin Validation (ROV) would block such conflicting BGP announcements and as a result lose traffic from the corresponding origins. Since the business incentives of networks are tightly coupled with the traffic they relay, filtering legitimate traffic leads to a loss of revenue, reducing the motivation to filter invalid announcements with ROV. In this work, we introduce a new mechanism, LOV, designed for whitelisting benign conflicts on an Internet scale. The resulting whitelist is made available to RPKI supporting ASes to avoid filtering RPKI-invalid but benign routes. Saving legitimate traffic resolves one main obstacle towards RPKI deployment. We measure live BGP updates using LOV during a period of half a year and whitelist 52,846 routes with benign origin errors.}

However, storing permanent biological characteristics such as fingerprints or faces in the database is risky. In this paper, we design and implement NailKey, a new biometric authentication approach that guarantees the mutability like traditional knowledge-based authentication like passwords, while maintaining the feature of unduplicatablility and usability in biometric authentication. NailKey uses existing capacitive fingerprint sensors to capture features on the edge of sanded fingernails. The inputs are very flat arches or ellipses with different shades. Based on the unique structural characteristics of the features, NailKey uses a tree-based algorithm to align and compare features accurately and efficiently. NailKey shows certain diversity and sustainability in the evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness and application potential of NailKey.}

Phishing simulations via email are a widespread tool used to measure user awareness, especially in workplace settings. However, current studies focusing on large-scale analysis of phishing simulations often have issues: The phishing simulations were conducted using a small sample size (mostly one or two organizations), or while many emails are sent, the analysis focuses only on specific companies. This study analyzes phishing simulations conducted over three years at 36 organizations with over 68\xa0000 delivered emails. We compare different dimensions of the organizations where these simulations were conducted, such as the economic sector and departments. Furthermore, we evaluate various dimensions of phishing simulation campaigns, such as detection difficulty and the scenario under which the simulation occurs. Our findings indicate significant disparities in the results, such as the industry sector in which the company operates. Moreover, we find substantial differences between the success rates of varying scenarios used for phishing emails.}

	abstract = {With the growing demands for user privacy protection, a variety of biometric user authentication mechanisms has been continuously developed. However, their performance evaluations are often conducted on limited population scales, sometimes involving as few as a dozen users. Whether such constrained evaluations can fully capture the true potential of these authentication mechanisms remains uncertain. To mitigate the impact of this issue, our study begins by exploring the feature subspace separability of user biometric data, thereby introducing the crucial role of population scale in shaping performance evaluations. Drawing on these insights, we develop a conditional generative adversarial network-based data generation framework tailored to synthesize "unseen user" data, to enlarge the evaluation population scale. Moreover, it incorporates spatial occupancy and distinguishability metrics as optimization objectives, striving for the generated data to closely align with real data distribution characteristics. Experimental results indicate that the performance of emerging authentication mechanisms exhibits variations as the user base grows: the recognition accuracy increases when generated data is included in the training set but decreases when such data is allocated to the test set. In general, our work facilitates a dynamic analysis of how performance evolves as user populations grow, providing deeper insights into the identity recognition ability of proposed authentication mechanisms.}

	abstract = {Modern organizations are persistently targeted by phishing emails. Despite advances in detection systems and widespread employee training, attackers continue to innovate, posing ongoing threats. Two emerging vectors stand out in the current landscape: QR-code baits and LLM-enabled pretexting. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of current defenses against these attacks, particularly when it comes to real-world impact on employees. This gap leaves uncertainty around to what extent related countermeasures are justified or needed. Our work addresses this issue. We conduct three phishing simulations across organizations of varying sizes—from small-medium businesses to a multinational enterprise. In total, we send over 71k emails targeting employees, including: a “traditional” phishing email with a click-through button; a nearly-identical “quishing” email with a QR code instead; and a phishing email written with the assistance of an LLM and open-source intelligence. Our results show that quishing emails have the same effectiveness as traditional phishing emails at luring users to the landing webpage—which is worrying, given that quishing emails are much harder to identify even by operational detectors. We also find that LLMs can be very good “social engineers”: in one company, over 30% of the emails opened led to visiting the landing webpage—a rate exceeding some prior benchmarks. Finally, we complement our study by conducting a survey across the organizations’ employees, measuring their “perceived” phishing awareness. Our findings suggest a correlation between higher self-reported awareness and organizational resilience to phishing attempts.}

	abstract = {Password strength meters (PSMs) have been widely used by websites to gauge password strength, encouraging users to create stronger passwords. Popular data-driven PSMs, e.g., based on Markov, Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG) and neural networks, alarm strength based on a model learned from real passwords. Despite their proven effectiveness, the secure utility that arises from the leakage of trained passwords remains largely overlooked. To address this gap, we analyze 11 PSMs and find that 5 data-driven meters are vulnerable to membership inference attacks that expose their trained passwords, and seriously, 3 rule-based meters openly disclose their blocked passwords. We specifically design a PSM privacy leakage evaluation approach, and uncover that a series of general data-driven meters are vulnerable to leaking between 10 4  to 10 5  trained passwords, with the PCFG-based models being more vulnerable than other counterparts; furthermore, we aid in deriving insights that the inherent utility-privacy tradeoff is not as severe as previously thought. To further exploit the risks, we develop novel meter-aware attacks when a clever attacker can filter the used passwords during compromising accounts on websites using the meter, and experimentally show that attackers targeting websites that deployed the popular Zxcvbn meter can compromise an additional 5.84% user accounts within 10 attempts, demonstrating the urgent need for privacy-preserving PSMs that protect the confidentiality of the meter’s used passwords. Finally, we sketch some counter-measures to mitigate these threats.}

	abstract = {Process injection is a core technique for malware authors to evade detection and enhance stealth. Despite its widespread use and importance in malware analysis, process injection remains underexplored in academic research, with prior work often limited to specific techniques or lacking a systematic approach. This paper proposes a principled analysis methodology centered on fundamental operational steps inherent to all known process injection variants. By looking for the co-occurrence of a minimal set of said steps and correlating them via memory address identity, our approach overcomes the accuracy and overhead limitations of prior studies, enables reliable detection and fine-grained analysis of process injection attacks with tenable run-time costs. We provide fresh insights into how threat actors leverage this technique by analyzing malware spotted in the wild from 2017 to 2023. An analysis of 56,340 representative samples from 2,667 malware families estimates process injection as a dominant evasion strategy, and suggests that threat actors continuously adapt their choices and implementation variants in response to evolving defense mechanisms and community knowledge. Comparative experiments then show that our method outperforms dedicated solutions and mainstream sandboxes in identifying injection activity. To foster future research, we share with the community the implementation, dataset, and experimental logs from this study.}

	abstract = {Host-based cryptomining malware, commonly known as cryptojackers, have gained notoriety for their stealth and the significant financial losses they cause in Linux-based cloud environments. Existing solutions often struggle with scalability due to high monitoring overhead, low detection accuracy against obfuscated behavior, and lack of integrated remediation. We present CryptoGuard, a lightweight hybrid solution that combines detection and remediation strategies to counter cryptojackers. To ensure scalability, CryptoGuard uses sketch- and sliding window-based syscall monitoring to collect behavior patterns with minimal overhead. It decomposes the classification task into a two-phase process, leveraging deep learning models to identify suspicious activity with high precision. To counter evasion techniques such as entry point poisoning and PID manipulation, CryptoGuard integrates targeted remediation mechanisms based on eBPF, a modern Linux kernel feature deployable on any compatible host. Evaluated on 123 real-world cryptojacker samples, it achieves average F1-scores of 96.12% and 92.26% across the two phases, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of true and false positive rates, while incurring only 0.06% CPU overhead per host.}

	abstract = {GPUs are increasingly utilized in modern virtual computing platforms, as they not only specialize in graphics-related tasks but also accelerate the computation of various workloads. Consequently, vendors are developing new GPU virtualization technologies to enable the efficient sharing of a single GPU in virtualized environments. However, these advancements also introduce the potential for novel attack scenarios. GPUs employ contexts to manage multiple processes, executing context save/restore operations during context switches. We devised an attack primitive that prematurely terminate context restoration by exploiting mechanisms within the context-switching process. This primitive allows other contexts to observe the state of previously executed contexts on the GPU. In virtual computing environments, where multiple virtual machines share a single GPU through GPU virtualization, an attacker with root privileges on one virtual machine can leverage this attack primitive to circumvent security boundaries between virtual machines. In this paper, we successfully established a covert channel between two distinct virtual machines and conducted a website fingerprinting attack. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to prevent the described attack.}

	abstract = {Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a vulnerability class that has become prominent in recent years. Attackers can weaponize such weaknesses as part of asymmetric cyberattacks that exploit the slow worst-case matching time of regular expression (regex) engines. In the past, problematic regexes have led to outages at Cloudflare and Stack Overflow, showing the severity of the problem. While ReDoS has drawn significant research attention, there has been no systematization of knowledge to delineate the state of the art and identify opportunities for further research. In this paper, we describe the existing knowledge on ReDoS. We first provide a systematic literature review, discussing approaches for detecting, preventing, and mitigating ReDoS vulnerabilities. Then, our engineering review surveys the latest regex engines to examine whether and how ReDoS defenses have been realized. Combining our findings, we observe that (1) in the literature, almost no studies evaluate whether and how ReDoS vulnerabilities can be weaponized against real systems, making it difficult to assess their real-world impact; and (2) from an engineering view, many mainstream regex engines have introduced partial or full ReDoS defenses, rendering many threat models obsolete. We conclude by highlighting avenues for future work. The open challenges in ReDoS research are to evaluate emerging defenses and support engineers in migrating to defended engines. We also highlight the parallel between performance bugs and asymmetric DoS, and we argue that future work should capitalize more on this similarity and adopt a more systematic view on ReDoS-like vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Security measures and patches typically come with a performance cost. While performance is a common metric to assess the practicality of security measures and patches, energy cost is typically ignored. However, it is unclear to what extent performance and energy costs of security correlate and to what extent they diverge. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of the energy costs of CVE fixes and mitigations. We use the Linux kernel as a case study. We perform energy-performance delta benchmarks using Intel RAPL on the two software versions or configurations under test on our i7-6700K. We automatically attribute CVEs from an 8-year time frame to patch sets, automatically compile the corresponding source code versions,  i.e. , pre-patch and post-patch, and automatically benchmark performance and energy consumption. Furthermore, we perform an evaluation of all kernel mitigations. We show that energy and performance costs diverge very clearly in some cases. One of these cases is the  retbleed IBPB  mitigation, with runtime increases of  0.4 %  and energy consumption decreases of  7.1 %  for the  apache  Phoronix benchmark. While not a fully indicative experiment, our work underscores the need for future security research to evaluate energy cost in addition to performance.}

	abstract = {The implementations of most hardened cryptographic libraries use defensive programming techniques for side-channel resistance. These techniques are usually specified as guidelines to developers on specific code patterns to use or avoid. Examples include performing arithmetic operations to choose between two variables instead of executing a secret-dependent branch. However, such techniques are only meaningful if they persist across compilation. In this paper, we investigate how optimizations used by modern compilers break the protections introduced by defensive programming techniques. Specifically, how compilers break high-level constant-time implementations used to mitigate timing side-channel attacks. We run a large-scale experiment to see if such compiler-induced issues manifest in state-of-the-art cryptographic libraries. We develop a tool that can profile virtually any architecture, and we use it to run trace-based dynamic analysis on 44,604 different targets. Particularly, we focus on the most widely deployed cryptographic libraries, which aim to provide side-channel resistance. We are able to evaluate whether their claims hold across various CPU architectures, including x86-64, x86-i386, armv7, aarch64, RISC-V, and MIPS-32. Our large-scale study reveals that several compiler-induced secret-dependent operations occur within some of the most highly regarded hardened cryptographic libraries – even when the high-level source code was formally verified to be free of side channels. To the best of our knowledge, such findings represent the first time these issues have been systematically observed in the wild and provide concrete data confirming previous speculations about defensive programming techniques’ limitations. One of the key takeaways of this paper is that the state-of-the-art defensive programming techniques employed for side-channel resistance are still inadequate, incomplete, and bound to fail when paired with the optimizations that compilers continuously introduce.}

To determine the current progress towards perfect decompilation, and to identify and quantify open problems for future work, we perform the first comprehensive empirical study on state-of-the-art C decompilers using our framework,  DiscScope , which employs symbolic execution and differential analysis to spot discrepancies in decompilation at intermediate program states, pinpointing the exact location where the decompiler makes errors. Using  DiscScope  and a dataset we built containing benign and malicious real-world programs, we measure the current performance of decompilers in a realistic setting. Our dataset contains programs compiled with different compilers (GCC and Clang) and with 7 different optimization levels. Manual validation of  DiscScope  shows that it is 96.3% accurate in identifying diverged and equivalent decompilation, which we then use to analyze 1,081,413 total decompiler outputs to build and quantify a taxonomy of open problems.}

	abstract = {Software analysis and reverse engineering are essential for identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing malware, and modifying software. Rediscovering function locations across versions is critical in security applications such as vulnerability tracking, malware analysis, and maintaining instrumentations. Software updates disrupt these workflows by changing function layouts, requiring re-identification in updated binaries. Binary Code Similarity Analysis (BCSA) can help, but most existing approaches are designed and evaluated for cross-optimization (XO), cross-compiler (XC), cross-architecture (XA), or cross-binary (XB) scenarios, not the cross-version (XV) setting. XV enables assumptions such as the stability of a function’s role and surrounding call graph, which are often invalidated by transformations like inlining or splitting in other settings. We explore BCSA for function rediscovery across software updates (XV). Our method incorporates version-specific call graphs and recursive neighborhood matching to improve accuracy. While neighborhood-based strategies are common, we generalize them through recursive application and contextual integration. Applied as a meta-algorithm, our approach refines both structural and embedding-based techniques. We also introduce an evaluation framework tailored to rediscovery, measuring effectiveness beyond accuracy or recall@1. Our metrics capture differences across function properties like size, call graph complexity, and uniqueness. The approach improves the accuracy of existing BCSA tools (e.g., Asm2Vec, SAFE) by up to 38.66% in XV settings, reaching 90.02% overall. Significant gains are seen for functions with limited call graph context (up to 78%) and for uniquely identifiable functions (up to 352%).}

	abstract = {Disassemblers are crucial in the analysis and modification of binaries. In practice, disassemblers are known to have errors. Existing works showing disassembler errors rely on heuristic implementation without specific guarantees. They also assume source code and compiler toolchains for ground truth. However, the assumption of source code is contrary to typical binary scenarios where only the binary is available. In this work, we investigate an approach with minimal assumptions and a sound approach to disassembly error evaluation that does not require source code. Use of source code does not address the fundamental problem of binary disassembly and fails when only the binary exists. As far as we know, this is the first work to evaluate disassembly errors using only the binary, together with comprehensive experiments and error findings. We propose TraceBin, which uses dynamic execution to find disassembly errors. TraceBin targets the use case where the disassembly is used in an automated fashion for security tasks on a target binary, such as static binary instrumentation, binary hardening, automated code repair, and so on, which may be affected by disassembly errors. Discovering disassembly errors in the target binary aids in reducing problems caused by such errors. Furthermore, we are unaware of existing approaches that can evaluate errors given only a target binary, as they require source code. Our evaluation shows TraceBin finds: (i) errors consistent with existing studies, even without source; (ii) disassembly errors identified as due to control flow; (iii) new interesting errors; (iv) errors in non-C/C++ binaries; (v) errors in closed-source binaries; and (vi) show that disassembly errors can have significant security implications using PoC attacks. Overall, our experimental results show that TraceBin finds many errors in existing popular disassemblers. It is also helpful in automated security tasks on (closed-source) binaries relying on disassemblers.}

	abstract = {Highly-optimized assembly is commonly used to achieve the best performance for popular cryptographic schemes such as the newly standardized ML-KEM and ML-DSA. The majority of implementations today rely on hand-optimized assembly for the core building blocks to achieve both security and performance. However, recent work by Abdulrahman et al. takes a new approach, writing a readable assembly implementation first and leaving the bulk of the optimization work to a tool named  SLOTHY  based on constraint programming.  SLOTHY  performs instruction scheduling, register allocation, and software pipelining simultaneously using constraints modeling the (micro-)architectural details of the target platform. In this work, we extend  SLOTHY  and investigate how it can be used to migrate already highly hand-optimized assembly to a different microarchitecture, while maximizing performance. As a case study, we optimize state-of-the-art Arm Cortex-M4 implementations of ML-KEM and ML-DSA for the Arm Cortex-M7. Our results suggest that this approach is promising: For the number-theoretic transform (NTT) – the core building block of both ML-DSA and ML-KEM – we achieve speed-ups of 1.97 × and 1.69 ×, respectively. For  Keccak – the permutation used by SHA-3 and SHAKE and also vastly used in ML-DSA and ML-KEM – we achieve speed-ups of 30% compared to the M4 code and 5% compared to hand-optimized M7 code. For many other building blocks, we achieve similarly significant speed-ups of up to 2.35 ×. Overall, this results in 11 to 33% faster code for the entire cryptosystems.}

	abstract = {Scripting languages such as Python and JavaScript have revolutionized modern software development thanks to their flexibility and rich functionalities. However, scripting languages provide a large attack surface, allowing adversaries to exploit bugs in the execution engines to perform sandbox escapes or execute arbitrary code. While fuzzing successfully revealed vulnerabilities in execution engines, current techniques still face scalability and semantic correctness challenges. Specifically, existing approaches fail to scale to multiple scripting languages and often lack semantic correctness. Reflecta , our novel scripting language fuzzer, relies solely on a common introspection feature in programming languages, namely  reflection , enabling a generic fuzzer design across different scripting languages. With reflection,  Reflecta  gains the capabilities to explore the rich set of language features dynamically, significantly reducing manual efforts.  Reflecta  thus manages to generate language-feature-rich programs and perform type-aware mutation, producing programs with high semantic correctness. We implemented  Reflecta  to fuzz six execution engines for four prevalent scripting languages, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.  Reflecta  achieves 1.74 x\xa0\xa03.35x improvement in semantic correctness and 1.63 x\xa0\xa02.21x improvement in code coverage compared to state-of-the-art language-general fuzzers and favorably compares to manually-augmented language-specific fuzzers without any prior semantic information. Moreover,  Reflecta  has discovered 25 unknown bugs confirmed by the developers of PHP, MRuby, and MicroPython, 16 of which have already been fixed.}

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of quantum computing has led to an increased use of cloud-based quantum devices, raising concerns over the privacy and security of computations on multi-tenant quantum systems. Previous studies have explored crosstalk in these environments, but several questions remain regarding its causes, countermeasures, and applicability. In this work, we revisit the crosstalk effect, tracing it to the SWAP path between qubits, demonstrating its effectiveness even over long distances. Specifically, we introduce a SWAP-based side-channel attack in both active and passive modes, validated on real IBM quantum devices. In the active attack, a single CNOT gate disrupts Grover’s Algorithm from afar with an  81.62 %  reduction in output accuracy. The passive attack, using a circuit just  6.25 %  of the victim’s size, achieves  100 %  accuracy in predicting circuit attributes in Simon’s Algorithm. These findings challenge the existing defense strategy of maximizing topological distance between circuits, demonstrating that attackers can still extract sensitive information or manipulate results remotely.}

Crates.io, the largest and primary repository for Rust packages, is no exception. This paper analyzes several known attack vectors targeting Rust packages on Crates.io, such as typosquatting attacks. We then propose an approach to flag typosquatting packages in Crates.io and scan them for malicious traits. Next, we conduct a preliminary assessment of the typosquatting candidates. Our study shows that, on average, each package has 5.7 typosquatting candidates. Scanning the candidates using our approach results in an average of 17.2 alerts per package that require further investigation.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable intellectual property in machine learning. To deter model theft,  Watermarking  has emerged as a prominent defense by embedding hidden “trigger sets” that aid in ownership verification. However, current watermarking solutions primarily address scenarios where adversaries steal the entire model. In this paper, we reveal a critical gap:  partial model extraction , where only a subset of classes is stolen, substantially degrading the watermark’s reliability. We introduce two attacks,  Partial Model Extraction  and  Partial Knowledge Distillation , which reduce watermark accuracy by up to 80% while retaining strong performance on the stolen classes. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 against two state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, we demonstrate the need for more robust watermarking strategies that resist partial-class theft.}

	abstract = {Reducing the attack surface of the OS kernel is an effective technique to enhance the security of application workloads. In Linux systems, developers can restrict the set of available system calls by using seccomp. Although being widely adopted in browsers, container runtimes, and sandboxing tools, this approach presents some challenges: (i) applying precise filters often requires significant application modifications, which can impede developer productivity, and (ii) the transparent enforcement of filters is bound to use a single, static list with every syscall the application might ever need, resulting in overly permissive and less effective security boundaries. In this paper, we propose an automated method to generate temporally-specialized seccomp filters tailored to the current application state. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of filters, and overcomes the major limitations associated with a single, static filter. We implement our solution by leveraging the eBPF subsystem in the Linux kernel. Specifically, we use in-kernel eBPF programs to monitor the application state and dynamically enable or disable specialized seccomp filters in response to state transitions. We discuss how this approach addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, we validate the feasibility of our proposal and show that it introduces a limited overhead.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Kubernetes is the leading platform for managing containerized application workloads. These are built of numerous  pods , groups of one or more containers that are always co-located and co-scheduled on the same node. Given a pod, the  scheduler  performs a critical task, i.e., it finds the best possible node for its execution. This process is affected by several factors, including resource availability, hardware requirements, data processing restrictions (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), workload sensitivity, and the presence of other workloads. Developers can control the scheduling process through several methods, such as node selectors, affinity, anti-affinity, and topology spread constraints. However, this activity is cumbersome, error prone, and can easily lead to security incidents. In this paper we propose an approach to constrain and validate pod scheduling decisions without relying on complex, handwritten node selection policies. The idea is to combine the node filtering capabilities of Kubernetes with the use of OPA Gatekeeper for automated policy enforcement. We discuss how this approach overcomes the limitation associated with existing solutions, and then describe how it is used to support corporate governance policies in common scenarios. Preliminary experiments confirm the applicability of our proposal.}

	abstract = {Smart contract vulnerabilities pose significant financial risks, making their detection and remediation critical before deployment. While numerous vulnerability detection tools exist, limited empirical research examines how smart contract vulnerabilities are patched and maintained in practice. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of patch management practices across smart contract ecosystems. Our study examined 4,345,088 smart contracts and identified 8,727 vulnerable contracts via an automated detection tool and 4,399 through user reports. Smart contract development practices widely acknowledge that vulnerable contracts should be destroyed and redeployed with appropriate fixes. However, we found that only 248 user-reported vulnerable contracts were self-destructed and only 6.85% of them were redeployed following destruction. Furthermore, these redeployed contracts still contained vulnerabilities, indicating ineffective patch implementation. These findings reveal significant shortcomings in current smart contract maintenance practices and highlight the need for improved security patch management protocols.}

Gaining this understanding allows us to assess the effectiveness of current detection and defense mechanisms. Insights from this work will help in building effective defenses to counter such sophisticated behavior. Traditional threat analysis methods rely on text heavy representations, making it difficult to identify attack trends efficiently. This work improves the usability of the MITRE ATT&CK framework by automating the extraction, comparison, and visualization of malware attack techniques. By analyzing five ICS targeting malware families BlackEnergy, Industroyer, Industroyer2, Pipedream, and Triton, our developed tool identifies recurring adversary tactics and provides structured heatmaps and network graphs for improved threat intelligence. This approach enables analysts to compare malware behaviors more effectively, prioritize security strategies, and strengthen ICS cybersecurity resilience.}

However, its impact on (transferable) adversarial examples remains unexplored. Specifically, we investigate the affect of MM on the transferability of adversarial examples — a black-box, adversarial attack where adversarial examples generated for surrogate model successfully mislead target model. Preliminary experiments on image classification models suggest, similar to recent findings of MM on backdoor attacks, where MM tends to sanitize the backdoor present in individual fine-tuned models, MM may not boost adversarial transferability. Our results suggest MM having minimal affect, and under certain conditions, inhibiting affect on vulnerability to transferable adversarial examples. Consequently, our preliminary findings suggest MM potentially giving a “free lunch” of adversarial robustness and provides important insights for designing more secure systems that employ MM.}
