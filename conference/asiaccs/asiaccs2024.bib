	abstract = {Data breaches in the cloud are on the rise and are becoming more costly to organizations each year. Client-side encryption refers to the practice of encrypting data on end users' devices before uploading it to the cloud. This approach ensures that data is encrypted during transit and storage, making data inaccessible to anyone without the decryption keys, including service providers and other potential attackers. In this talk, we will first look at the challenges of client-side encryption and provide an overview of the key advancements as well as setbacks in addressing these challenges in the past two decades, including scalable access of encrypted data and search over encrypted data. There are numerous academic publications in this area and the choice of which techniques to use could have significant impact on the system's security, efficiency, and usability. Finally, we will present our design and implementation of a client-side encryption system for enterprise users.}

	abstract = {In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of domain generation algorithm (DGA) classifiers. We implement 32 white-box attacks, 19 of which are very effective and induce a false-negative rate (FNR) of â‰ˆ 100% on unhardened classifiers. To defend the classifiers, we evaluate different hardening approaches and propose a novel training scheme that leverages adversarial latent space vectors and discretized adversarial domains to significantly improve robustness. In our study, we highlight a pitfall to avoid when hardening classifiers and uncover training biases that can be easily exploited by attackers to bypass detection, but which can be mitigated by adversarial training (AT). In our study, we do not observe any trade-off between robustness and performance, on the contrary, hardening improves a classifier's detection performance for known and unknown DGAs. We implement all attacks and defenses discussed in this paper as a standalone library, which we make publicly available1 to facilitate hardening of DGA classifiers.}

	abstract = {The Internet is a critical resource in the daily life of billions of users. To support the growing number of users and their increasing demands, operators continuously scale their network footprint---e.g., by joining Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)---and adopt relevant technologies---such as IPv6---which provides a vastly larger address space than its predecessor. In this paper, we revisit prefix de-aggregation attacks in the light of these two changes and introduce Kirin---an advanced BGP prefix de-aggregation attack that announces millions of IPv6 routes via thousands of IXP connections to overflow the memory of routers within remote ASes. Kirin's highly distributed nature allows it to bypass traditional route-flooding defense mechanisms, such as per-session prefix limits or route flap damping. We analyze Kirin's theoretical feasibility by formulating it as a mathematical optimization problem, test for practical hurdles by deploying enough infrastructure to perform a micro-scale Kirin attack using 4 IXPs, and validate our assumptions via BGP data analysis, real-world measurements, and router testbed experiments. Despite its low deployment cost, we find that Kirin may inject lethal amounts of routes into the routers of thousands of ASes.}

	abstract = {While internet communications have been originally all in the clear, the past decade has seen secure protocols like TLS becoming pervasive, significantly improving internet security for individuals and enterprises. However, encrypted traffic raises new challenges for intrusion detection and network monitoring. Existing interception solutions such as Man-In-The-Middle are undesirable in many settings: they tend to lower overall security or are challenging to use at scale. We present X-Ray-TLS, a new target-agnostic TLS decryption method that supports TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and QUIC. Our method relies only on existing kernel facilities and does not require a hypervisor or modification of the target programs, making it easily applicable at scale. X-Ray-TLS works on major TLS libraries by extracting TLS secrets from process memory using a memory changes reconstruction algorithm. It works with TLS hardening, such as certificate pinning and perfect forward secrecy. We benchmark X-Ray-TLS on major TLS libraries, CLI tools, and a web browser. We show that X-Ray-TLS significantly reduces the manual effort required to decrypt TLS traffic of programs running locally, thus simplifying security analysis or reverse engineering. We identified several use cases for X-Ray-TLS, such as large-scale TLS decryption for CI/CD pipelines to support the detection of software supply chain attacks.}

	abstract = {We introduce a novel approach for mapping attack behaviors described in threat analysis reports to entries in an adversarial techniques knowledge base. Our method leverages a multi-stage ranking architecture to efficiently rank the most related techniques based on their semantic relevance to the input text. Each ranker in our pipeline uses a distinct design for text representation. To enhance relevance modeling, we leverage pretrained language models, which we fine-tune for the technique annotation task. While generic large language models are not yet capable of fully addressing this challenge, we obtain very promising results. We achieve a recall rate improvement of +35% compared to the previous state-of-the-art results. We further create new public benchmark datasets for training and validating methods in this domain, which we release to the research community aiming to promote future research in this important direction.}

	abstract = {With ubiquitous Internet connectivity, home routers have become a cornerstone of our digital lives, often deployed with minimal changes to the factory default settings. However, if left unexamined, these settings can pose risks to user security and privacy. To systematically evaluate potential risks, we developed a threat model-based framework and conducted a comprehensive analysis of 40 commercial off-the-shelf home routers, representative of recent models across 14 brands. We surveyed 81 parameters and behaviors including default and deep default settings. We identified a variety of security flaws including the exposure of IPv6 local devices due to a lack of firewall protection, vulnerable Wi-Fi security protocols, open Wi-Fi networks and trivial admin passwords for "plug-and-play" routers, and unencrypted firmware update communications. We also discovered concealed WPS PIN support --- at times associated with a trivial PIN. In total, we are reporting 30 exploitable vulnerabilities to the vendors. This paper highlights the need for heightened scrutiny of default router settings, providing valuable insights to both manufacturers and consumers for enhancing home network security. Our findings underscore the importance of meticulous device configuration, advocating for proactive measures from all stakeholders to mitigate the threats posed by insecure router default settings.}

	abstract = {An ongoing challenge in censorship circumvention is optimizing the stealthiness of communications, enabled by covert channels. Recently, a new variant called history covert channels has been proposed. Instead of modifying or mimicking legitimate data, such channels solely point to observed data matching secret information. This approach reduces the amount of secret data a sender explicitly must transfer and thus limits detectability. However, the only published history channel is only suitable for special scenarios due to severe limitations in terms of bandwidth. We propose a significant performance enhancement of history covert channels that allows their use in real-world scenarios through utilizing the content of online social media and online archives. Our approach, which we call OPPRESSION (Open-knowledge Compression), takes advantage of the massive amounts of textual data on the Internet that can be referenced by short pointer messages. Broadly, OPPRESSION can be considered a novel encoding strategy for censorship circumvention. We further present and evaluate our open source proof-of-concept implementation of OPPRESSION that can transfer secret data by pointing to popular online media, such as Twitter (now "X"), news websites, Wikipedia entries, and online books. The pointer itself is transmitted through existing censorship circumvention systems. Our approach minimizes the amount of traffic to be concealed in comparison to existing works, even in comparison to compression.}

	abstract = {Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems have emerged as a critical component of enterprise security solutions, effectively combating endpoint threats like APT attacks with extended lifecycles. In light of the growing significance of endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, many cybersecurity providers have developed their own proprietary EDR solutions. It's crucial for users to assess the capabilities of these detection engines to make informed decisions about which products to choose. This is especially urgent given the market's size, which is expected to reach around 3.7 billion dollars by 2023 and is still expanding. MITRE is a leading organization in cyber threat analysis. In 2018, MITRE started to conduct annual APT emulations that cover major EDR vendors worldwide. Indicators include telemetry, detection and blocking capability, etc. Nevertheless, the evaluation results published by MITRE don't contain any further interpretations or suggestions. In this paper, we thoroughly analyzed MITRE evaluation results to gain further insights into real-world EDR systems under test. Specifically, we designed a whole-graph analysis method, which utilizes additional control flow and data flow information to measure the performance of EDR systems. Besides, we analyze MITRE evaluation's results over multiple years from various aspects, including detection coverage, detection confidence, detection modifier, data source, compatibility, etc. Through the above studies, we have compiled a thorough summary of our findings and gained valuable insights from the evaluation results. We believe these summaries and insights can assist researchers, practitioners, and vendors in better understanding the strengths and limitations of mainstream EDR products.}

	abstract = {How can we identify live Command & Control (C2) servers for a given IoT malware binary? An effective solution to this problem constitutes a significant capability towards detecting and containing botnets. This task is not trivial because C2 servers are short-lived, and they use sophisticated and proprietary communication protocols. We propose C2Miner, a novel approach to trick IoT malware binaries into revealing their currently live C2 servers. Our approach weaponizes old disposable IoT malware binaries and uses them to probe active servers. We provide novel solutions to overcome the following challenges: (a) disambiguating the C2-bound traffic generated by the malware and (b) determining if a target IP:port is indeed a C2 server as opposed to a benign server. In our evaluation, based on 3M distinct exploration attempts over 150K distinct IP addresses, we show that we can identify C2 servers within a given IP:port space with an F1 score of 86%. In addition, we show how our approach can be used in practice and at scale. Conducting a large-scale probing campaign has scalability issues given that the number of probes is proportional to the IP addresses, the number of ports, and the number of binaries from distinct families which we want to explore. To address this challenge, we propose a grammar-based method to fingerprint and cluster C2 communications which, among other applications, allows us to select malware binaries for weaponization efficiently. Additionally, we use spatio-temporal features of C2 servers to narrow down our search in the entire IP space. An optimistic observation from our study is that using only 2 (more than 6 months) old IoT malware binaries, we scan 18K IP:port pairs daily for 6 days and find 6 new live C2 servers.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of GPUs for general-purpose computations has steadily increased. As security-critical computations like AES are becoming more common on GPUs, the scrutiny must also increase. At the same time, new technologies like WebGPU put easy access to compute shaders in every web browser. Prior work has shown that GPU caches are vulnerable to the same eviction-based attacks as CPUs, e.g., Prime+Probe, from native code. In this paper, we present the first GPU cache side-channel attack from within the browser, more specifically from the restricted WebGPU environment. The foundation for our generic and automated attacks are self-configuring primitives applicable to a wide variety of devices, which we demonstrate on a set of 11 desktop GPUs from 5 different generations and 2 vendors. We leverage features of the new WebGPU standard to create shaders that implement all building blocks needed for cache side-channel attacks, such as techniques to distinguish L2 cache hits from misses. Beyond the state of the art, we leverage the massive parallelism of modern GPUs to design the first parallelized eviction set construction algorithm. Based on our attack primitives, we present three case studies: First, we present an inter-keystroke timing attack with high F1-scores, i.e., 82% to 98% on NVIDIA. Second, we demonstrate a generic, set-agnostic, end-to-end attack on a GPU-based AES encryption service, leaking a full AES key in 6 minutes. Third, we evaluate a native-to-browser data-exfiltration scenario with a Prime+Probe covert channel that achieves transmission rates of up to 10.9 kB/s. Our attacks require no user interaction and work in a time frame that easily enables drive-by attacks while browsing the Internet. Our work emphasizes that browser vendors need to treat access to the GPU similar to other security- and privacy-related resources.}

This paper presents covert channels within ML models trained and publicly deployed in cloud-based (black-box) environments. The approach relies on targeted poisoning, or backdoor, attacks to encode messages into the model. It incorporates multiple well-chosen backdoors only through dataset poisoning and without requiring access to model internals or the training process. After model deployment, messages can be extracted via inference. We propose three covert channel versions with varying levels of message robustness and capacity while emphasizing minimal extraction effort, minimal pre-shared knowledge, or maximum message stealthiness. We investigate influencing factors affecting embedded backdoors and propose novel techniques to incorporate numerous backdoors simultaneously for message encoding. Experiments across various datasets and model architectures demonstrate message transmission of 20 to 66 bits with minimal error rates.}

	abstract = {Microarchitectural attacks on CPU structures have been studied in native applications, as well as in web browsers. These attacks continue to be a substantial threat to computing systems at all scales. With the proliferation of heterogeneous systems and integration of hardware accelerators in every computing system, modern web browsers provide the support of GPU-based acceleration for the graphics and rendering processes. Emerging web standards also support the GPU acceleration of general-purpose computation within web browsers. In this paper, we present a new attack vector for microarchitectural attacks in web browsers. We use emerging GPU accelerating APIs in modern browsers (specifically WebGPU) to launch a GPU-based cache side channel attack on the compute stack of the GPU that spies on victim activities on the graphics (rendering) stack of the GPU. Unlike prior works that rely on JavaScript APIs or software interfaces to build timing primitives, we build the timer using GPU hardware resources and develop a cache side channel attack on Intel's integrated GPUs. We leverage the GPU's inherent parallelism at different levels to develop high-resolution parallel attacks. We demonstrate that GPU-based cache attacks can achieve a precision of 90% for website fingerprinting of 100 top websites. We also discuss potential countermeasures against the proposed attack to secure the systems at a critical time when these web standards are being developed and before they are widely deployed.}

	abstract = {Sharing microarchitectural components between co-resident programs leads to potential information leaks, with devastating implications on security. Over the last decade, multiple proposals suggested monitoring hardware performance counters as a method for detecting such attacks. In this work we investigate these proposals and find that the promising results presented in most are unlikely to carry over to realistic use scenarios. We identify four main shortcomings affecting many of the proposals: implications of detection accuracy, unaccounted performance overheads, undocumented or slow detection speed and a weak threat model. We further find that research artifacts for the vast majority of proposals are not available, significantly hampering the reproducibility and scientific validation of the results. To overcome the reproducibility issue, we implement a detection scheme similar to those proposed in literature, achieving results similar to those in the literature. We then focus on the last shortcoming---the weak threat model. We observe that the threat model in existing proposals assumes that the attacker uses some variants of published proof-of-concept attacks, without trying to hide the attack. Instead, we propose an attack that modifies a benign program. We demonstrate that such attacks remain feasible, yet display no statistically significant variations in performance counter values. Hence, such attacks cannot be detected by monitoring performance counters. We therefore conclude that despite the large number of proposals, side-channel attack detection with hardware performance counters is not yet ready for real-world deployment.}

	abstract = {Randomization has proven to be a effective defense against conflict-based side-channel attacks in a shared cache. It improves security by assigning a unique randomization scheme to each security domain, e.g., though a different hashing function. However, if two domains have shared data, the domains must be fused in order to guarantee correctness (i.e., data coherence). Such domain fusion significantly reduces the effectiveness of randomization and weakens its security protection. We propose randomization with sharing (RAWS), which enables secure cross-domain accesses while enforcing cache coherence (and thus data coherence). Based on RAWS, we design a non-fusion based inter-domain coherence protocol (NF-IDCP). NF-IDCP enables cache coherence by looking up and flushing multiple cache lines associated with shared-writable data during their cross-domain accesses. Furthermore, NF-IDCP uses constant-delay banking to securely reduce the latency of the cache line flushes. We also use a secure tag-based filter (STF) to reduce flush costs, for example, by explicitly storing the exact cache locations to be flushed. The security evaluation shows that conflict attacks on the optimized NF-IDCP structures cannot leak conflict observations at a meaningful rate. Attack simulations using CacheFX demonstrate that domain fusion significantly retards the protection provided by randomization schemes. Performance overhead of SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC 3.0 benchmarks is evaluated on ZSim, a microarchitectural simulator. To study the performance impact on realistic workloads, such as Firefox, Chromium and X Server, we use a cache simulator built on top of PANDA, a full-system emulator. Across all configurations, the average performance overhead is less than 5%, and the hardware overhead is less than 3% compared to a domain-fused randomization.}

	abstract = {Since the advent of Spectre attacks, researchers and practitioners have developed a range of hardware and software measures to counter transient execution attacks. A prime example of such mitigation is speculative load hardening (slh) in LLVM, which protects against leaks by tracking the speculation state and masking values during misspeculation. LLVM relies on static analysis to harden programs using slh that often results in over-protection, which incurs performance overhead. We extended an existing side-channel model validation framework, Scam-V, to check the vulnerability of programs to Spectre-PHT attacks and optimize the protection of programs using the slh approach. We illustrate the efficacy of Scam-V by first demonstrating that it can automatically identify Spectre vulnerabilities in programs, e.g., fragments of crypto-libraries. We then develop an optimization mechanism to validate the necessity of slh hardening w.r.t. the target platform. Our experiments showed that hardening introduced by LLVM in most cases could be improved when the underlying microarchitecture properties are considered.}

	abstract = {Spectre-BTB, also known as Spectre Variant 2, is often considered the most dangerous Spectre variant. While there are widely-deployed software workarounds on x86, such as Retpoline, there are no automated software workarounds for protecting generic userspace applications on ARMv8. Moreover, hardware solutions do not consider in-place mistraining or variants such as branch-history injection (Spectre-BHI), also known as Spectre-BHB. In this paper, we introduce Switchpoline, the first automated Spectre-BTB and Spectre-BHB software workaround protecting C and C++ userspace applications on ARMv8 against all variants of Spectre-BTB and Spectre-BHB. The main security of Switchpoline is that eliminating indirect branches eliminates attacks on indirect branches. Switchpoline is based on a static compiler pass and a dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compiler component that rewrite indirect control-flow transfers into direct control-flow transfers. Switchpoline successfully prevents Spectre-BTB and Spectre-BHB in userspace applications with a negligible mean performance overhead of 1.8% measured in the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark. Moreover, unlike many x86-specific mitigations, Switchpoline is compatible with existing orthogonal defenses, such as (hardware) CFI or Spectre-PHT mitigations. Hence, Switchpoline is a practical generic software mitigation on ARMv8.}

	abstract = {Mitigating side-channel leakage in cryptographic components is a vital concern for developers working with embedded devices. Conventional side-channel analysis demands substantial manual effort for setup preparation and trace recording, rendering it more intricate during the dynamic design phase, where software alterations occur frequently. Additionally, identifying the specific instruction(s) responsible for leakage has been hindered by limited hardware descriptions and restricted access to process technology information. We introduce ABBY, an open-source side-channel leakage profiling framework that targets the microarchitectural layer. Existing solutions to characterize the microarchitectural layer are device-specific and/or require extensive manual effort. ABBY's main innovation is data collection, which can automatically characterize the microarchitectural behaviour of a target device and has the additional benefit of being extendable to other similar devices. Using ABBY, we created two datasets that capture the interaction of instructions for the ARM CORTEX-M0/M3 architecture. These sets are the first to capture detailed information on the microarchitectural layer. They can be used to explore various leakage models suitable for creating side-channel leakage simulators. A preliminary evaluation of a leakage model produced with our dataset of real-world cryptographic implementations shows performance comparable to state-of-the-art leakage simulators.}

	abstract = {Popularity-based secure deduplication scheme classifies data based on their number of owners and provides different levels of security for a trade-off between privacy preservation and storage savings. Most existing schemes rely on a trusted third party to record data popularity using deterministic tags, which is impractical in reality. Recently, Ha et al. propose a scheme that uses random tags to record popularity without the need for a trusted third party. However, their scheme is vulnerable to a malicious cloud launching smuggle attacks (SAs) and popularity-faking attacks (PFAs), which poses security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving popularity-based deduplication scheme. For one thing, we use unforgeable random tags to record data popularity, which defends against SAs. For another thing, we design a verifiable interactive popularity detection scheme to assure the correctness of popularity detection and resist PFAs. Security analysis and evaluation results show that our proposed scheme provides stronger security guarantees with limited overhead compared with existing schemes.}

Tackling a widely used distance metric, Nomadic studies the privacy-preserving evaluation of cosine similarity in a two-party (2PC) distributed setting. We illustrate this setting in a scenario where a client uses biometrics to authenticate to a service provider, outsourcing the distance calculation to two computing servers. In this setting, we propose two novel 2PC protocols to evaluate the normalising cosine similarity between non-normalised two vectors followed by comparison to a public threshold, one in the semi-honest and one in the malicious setting. Our protocols combine additive secret sharing with function secret sharing, saving one communication round by employing a new building block to compute the composition of a function f yielding a binary result with a subsequent binary gate. Overall, our protocols outperform all prior works, requiring only two communication rounds under a strong threat model that also deals with malicious inputs via normalisation. We evaluate our protocols in the setting of biometric authentication using voice, and the obtained results reveal a notable efficiency improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art works.}

	abstract = {As a well known machine learning model, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is widely used in many real-world scenes such as online marketing, risk management, fraud detection and recommendation systems. Due to limited data resources, two data owners may collaborate with each other to jointly train a high-quality model. As privacy regulations such as HIPPA and GDPR come into force, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) has drawn increasingly higher attention. Recently, a line of works [3--6] studies function secret sharing (FSS) schemes in the preprocessing model, where the online stage of secure two-party computation (2PC) is significantly improved. While recent privacy-preserving GDBT frameworks mainly focus on improving the performance of a singular module (e.g. secure bucket aggregation), we propose SiGBDT, a globally silent two-party GBDT framework via function secret sharing on a vertically partitioned dataset. During the training process, we apply FSS schemes to construct efficient modular protocols, such as secure bucket aggregation, argmax computation and a node split approach. We run in-depth experiments and discover that SiGBDT completely outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks. The experiment results show that SiGBDT is at least 3.32 X faster in LAN and at least 6.4 X faster in WAN.}

	abstract = {The kidney exchange problem (KEP) seeks to find possible exchanges among pairs of patients and their incompatible kidney donors while meeting specific optimization criteria such as maximizing the overall number of possible transplants. Recently, several privacy-preserving protocols for solving the KEP have been proposed. However, the protocols known to date lack scalability in practice since the KEP is an NP-complete problem. We address this issue by proposing a novel privacy-preserving protocol which computes an approximate solution for the KEP that scales well for the large numbers of patient-donor pairs encountered in practice. As opposed to prior work on privacy-preserving kidney exchange, our protocol is generic w.r.t. the security model that can be employed. Compared to the most efficient privacy-preserving protocols for kidney exchange existing to date, our protocol is entirely data oblivious and it exhibits a far superior run time performance. As a second contribution, we use a real-world data set to simulate the application of our protocol as part of a kidney exchange platform, where patient-donor pairs register and de-register over time, and thereby determine its approximation quality in a real-world setting.}

	abstract = {Multiparty computation (MPC) over rings such as Z264 has received a great deal of attention recently due to its ease of implementation and attractive performance. We assume there are n parties and the adversary corrupts t of them, where 2t < n. In this work, we leverage RMFEs (Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings) to build an MPC protocol over Zpk with constant online communication. An (l, d)-RMFE packs l elements from Zpk into an element in GR(pk, d) = Zpk [X]/h(X), where deg h = d. The existence of asymptotically good RMFE ensures that d/l is bounded by a constant independent of n. We show that the method from Turbopack applies to honest majority secure multiparty computation over Zpk in the preprocessing model, achieving perfect security and the best online communication complexity. In the semi-honest setting, we build a secure multiparty computation protocol over Zpk based on the packed Shamir secret-sharing over an extension ring and RMFEs. The online communication requires 12d/l elements per multiplication gate. The communication cost per multiplication gate in the preprocessing phase is Î˜(n log n). This is the first protocol over Zpk such that an arithmetic circuit can be evaluated with overall communication complexity O(1) elements per multiplication gate.}

	abstract = {Enhancing privacy on smart contract-enabled blockchains has garnered much attention in recent research. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is one of the most popular approaches, however, they fail to provide full expressiveness and fine-grained privacy. To illustrate this, we underscore an underexplored type of Miner Extractable Value (MEV), called Residual Bids Extractable Value (RBEV). Residual bids highlight the vulnerability where unfulfilled bids inadvertently reveal traders' unmet demands and prospective trading strategies, thus exposing them to exploitation. ZKP-based approaches failed to address RBEV as they cannot provide post-execution privacy without some level of information disclosure. Other MEV mitigations like fair-ordering protocols also failed to address RBEV. We introduce Ratel, an innovative framework bridging a multi-party computation (MPC) prototyping framework (MP-SPDZ) and a smart contract language (Solidity), harmonizing the privacy with full expressiveness of MPC with Solidity 's on-chain programmability. This synergy empowers developers to effortlessly craft privacy-preserving decentralized applications (DApps). We demonstrate Ratel's efficacy through two distinguished decentralized finance (DeFi) applications: a decentralized exchange and a collateral auction, effectively mitigating the potential RBEV issue. Furthermore, Ratel is equipped with a lightweight crash-reset mechanism, enabling the seamless recovery of transiently benign faulty nodes. To prevent the crash-reset mechanism abused by malicious entities and ward off DoS attacks, we incorporate a cost-utility analysis anchored in the Bayesian approach. Our performance evaluation of the applications developed under the Ratel framework underscores their competency in managing real-world peak-time workloads.}

	abstract = {We propose a new physical-layer public key encryption scheme and establish a trapdoor one-way function through Massive MIMO techniques and precoding designs. Under standard arguments, we show that the eavesdropper's decoding complexity grows exponentially with the number of antennas, while the legitimate receiver's decoding complexity grows only quadratically. The proposed scheme builds a bridge between information-theoretic security and cryptographic security. Compared to the traditional physical-layer security, the proposed scheme is secure when the number of the eavesdropper's antennas is infinite or much larger than the number of transmitter/receiver antennas, provided that the eavesdropper's distance from the legitimate receiver is less than one-half of the wavelength, or that the channel estimation process between the sender-receiver pair is broken by the eavesdropper. Because the scheme is based on lattice, not on channel reciprocity, it can be applied to both time-division duplex and frequency-division duplex channels, and utilizes the simple physical layer characteristics of Massive MIMO to resist the currently known quantum attacks. The proposed scheme is adapted to the future requirements of 6G for the security of communication, and provides a new idea for the post-quantum cryptosystem. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a decoding bit error rate (BER) close to 0.5 at the eavesdropper and almost 0 at the legitimate receiver.}

	abstract = {International bypass fraud, also known as SIMBox fraud, involves diverting international cellular voice traffic from regulated routes and rerouting it as local calls in the destination country. It has significantly affected cellular networks worldwide, generating $3.11 Billion of losses annually and threats to national security. Yet, SIMBox fraud remains an ongoing challenge, eluding operators detection due to the continual refinement of fraudulent behavior that is often overlooked in the design and validation of detection methods. This paper introduces a game-based formalization of the SIMBox fraud problem, delineating two key players-the adversary and the investigator-along with their strategies and a set of metrics gauging their efficacy in the game. We develop a practical framework for the empirical evaluation of the fraud, incorporating current adversary and investigator capabilities and accommodating seamless adaptation to the evolving nature of fraud. Our analysis identifies up to 345,600,000 possible adversary strategies from in-market SIMBox appliances functionalities. The most sophisticated strategies decisively outperform the most efficient existing detection methods, underscoring the literature's lack of awareness of fraud capabilities. Furthermore, we uncover fraud vulnerabilities and discuss their implications for enhancing future detection strategies in practice. In essence, our work introduces a novel paradigm in SIMBox fraud detection that adapts seamlessly to the ever-changing landscape of fraud, treating it as a fundamental aspect of the detection strategy.}

	abstract = {Since Android is the most widespread operating system, malware targeting it poses a severe threat to the security and privacy of millions of users and is increasing from year to year. The response from the community was swift, and many researchers have ventured to defend this system. In this cat-and-mouse game, attackers pay special attention to flying under the radar of analysis tools, and the techniques to understand whether their app is under analysis have become more and more sophisticated. Moreover, these evasive techniques are also adopted by benign apps to deter reverse engineering, making this phenomenon pervasive in the Android app ecosystem. While the scientific literature has proposed many evasive techniques and investigated their impact, one aspect still needs to be studied: how and to what extent Android apps, both malware and goodware, use such controls. This paper fills this gap by introducing a comprehensive taxonomy of evasive controls for the Android ecosystem and a proof-of-concept app that implements them all. We release the app as open source to help researchers and practitioners to assess whether their app analysis systems are sufficiently resilient to known evasion techniques. We also propose DroidDungeon, a novel probe-based sandbox, which circumvents evasive techniques thanks to a substantial engineering effort, making the apps under analysis believe they are running on an actual device. To the best of our knowledge, currently, DroidDungeon is the only solution providing anti-evasion capabilities, maintainability, and scalability at once. Using our sandbox, we studied evasive controls in both benign and malicious Android apps, revealing insights about their purpose, differences, and relationships between evasive controls and packers/protectors. Finally, we analyzed how the execution of an app differs depending on the presence or absence of evasive counter-measures. Our main finding is that 14% and 4% of malicious and benign samples refrain from running in an analysis environment that does not correctly mitigate evasive controls.}

	abstract = {To facilitate dynamic spectrum sharing, the FCC has designated certified SAS administrators to implement their own spectrum access systems (SASs) that manage the shared spectrum usage in the novel CBRS band. As a premise, different SAS servers must conduct periodic inter-SAS coordination to synchronize service states and avoid allocation conflicts. However, SAS servers may inevitably stop service for regular upgrades, crash down, or even perform maliciously that deviate from the normal routines, posing a fundamental operation security problem --- the system shall be robust against these faults to guarantee secure and efficient spectrum sharing service. Unfortunately, the incumbent inter-SAS coordination mechanism, CPAS, is prone to SAS failures and does not support real-time allocation. Recent proposals that rely on blockchain smart contracts or state machine replication mechanisms to realize fault-tolerant inter-SAS coordination require all SASs to follow a unified allocation algorithm. They however face performance bottlenecks and cannot accommodate the current fact that different SASs hold their own proprietary allocation algorithms. In this work, we propose TriSAS---a novel inter-SAS coordination mechanism to facilitate secure, efficient, and dependable spectrum allocation that is fully compatible with the existing SAS infrastructure. TriSAS decomposes the coordination process into two phases including input synchronization and decision finalization. The first phase ensures participants share a common input set while the second one fulfills a fair and verifiable spectrum allocation selection, which is generated efficiently via SAS proposers' proprietary allocation algorithms and evaluated by a customized designed allocation evaluation algorithm (AEA), in the face of no more than one-third of malicious participants. We implemented a prototype of TriSAS on the AWS cloud computing platform and evaluated its throughput and latency performance. The results show that TriSAS achieves high transaction throughput and low latency under various practical settings.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in cross-technology communication can support direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices (i.e., WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE) without requiring any modifications to the hardware, which has significantly improved the communication efficiency and shown great advantages for supporting smart applications. However, until now a key establishment protocol to support secure and reliable asymmetric cross- technology communication (CTC) is missing, which introduces severe privacy and security issues. Existing solutions are not designed for CTC, since they mainly focus on the symmetric communication among homogeneous IoT devices. In this work, we present a Key Establishment Protocol (KEP), which explores and lever- ages the unique feature of CTC - Possibility PN Sequence Reception (PSR) to not only perform key establishment between heterogeneous IoT devices with different physical layers (i.e., WiFi and ZigBee) but also improve the communication reliability at the same time. Our extensive real-world experiments show that KEP can finish the key establishment in seconds and effectively defend against multiple types of attacks. Furthermore, KEP doubles the packet reception ratio compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {In this work, a novel FPGA-based data-binding architecture incorporating PUFs and a user-specific encryption key to protect the confidentiality of data on external non-volatile memories is presented. By utilizing an intrinsic PUF derived from the same memory, the confidential data is additionally bound to the device. This feature proves valuable in cases where software is restricted to be executed exclusively on specific hardware or privacy-critical data is not allowed to be decrypted elsewhere. To improve the resistance against hardware attacks, a novel method to randomly select memory cells utilized for PUF measurements is presented. The FPGA-based design presented in this work allows for low latency as well as small area utilization, offers high adaptability to diverse hardware and software platforms, and is accessible from bare-metal programs to full Linux kernels. Moreover, a detailed performance and security evaluation is conducted on five boards. A single read or write operation can be executed in 0.58 Î¼s when utilizing the lightweight PRINCE cipher on an AMD Zync 7000 MPSoC. Furthermore, the entire architecture occupies only about 10% of the FPGA's available space on a resource-constrained AMD PYNQ-Z2. Ultimately, the implementation is demonstrated by storing confidential user data on new generations of network base stations equipped with FPGAs.}

	abstract = {Rowhammer has drawn much attention from both academia and industry in the past years as rowhammer exploitation poses severe consequences to system security. Since the first comprehensive study of rowhammer in 2014, a number of rowhammer attacks have been demonstrated against dynamic random access memory (DRAM)-based commodity systems to break software confidentiality, integrity and availability. Accordingly, numerous software defenses have been proposed to mitigate rowhammer attacks on commodity systems of either legacy (e.g., DDR3) or recent DRAM (e.g., DDR4). Besides, multiple hardware defenses (e.g., Target Row Refresh) from the industry have been deployed into recent DRAM to eliminate rowhammer, which we categorize as production defenses. In this paper, we systematize rowhammer attacks and defenses with a focus on DRAM-based commodity systems. Particularly, we have established a unified framework demonstrating how a rowhammer attack affects a commodity system. With the framework, we characterize existing attacks, shedding light on new attack vectors that have not yet been explored. We further leverage the framework to categorize software and production defenses, generalize their key defense strategies and summarize their key limitations, from which potential defense strategies are identified.}

	abstract = {The foundation of trusted computation depends on the ability to verify the authenticity of the underlying hardware. This need is further compounded by the presence of counterfeit components in the market, highlighting the necessity for pre-deployment and run-time chip identification techniques. Current solutions involve burning authentication information in physical fuses or creating a unique mask for each integrated circuit, which are either costly or susceptible to forgery. While many solutions have been proposed to prevent chip counterfeiting at design time, no accurate, reference-free, and cost-effective solutions exist for chip buyers to authenticate their purchases in the pre-deployment phase and enable software-level verification at runtime. The lack of industry-standard authentication methods forces chip buyers to either adopt expensive solutions, such as X-Ray imaging, or simply rely on blind faith. This paper presents SKU-RAM, a technique for chip identification that allows manufacturers to embed their signature into integrated circuits, provides per-device identification, and facilitates hardware-enforced time-limited licensing functionality. Our approach takes advantage of the aging-induced power-on state changes in SRAM to encode authentication data into an already fabricated device, without modifying the mask of the chips. This hardware-overhead-free augmentation to the chips eliminates numerous instances of chip counterfeiting and enables software-level authentication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SKU-RAM as a comprehensive and scalable anti-counterfeiting solution for existing and future computing devices using commercial off-the-shelf microcontrollers and microprocessors and multi-year real-time experiments.}

	abstract = {In the past decade, many vulnerabilities were discovered in microarchitectures which yielded attack vectors and motivated the study of countermeasures. Further, architectural and physical imperfections in DRAMs led to the discovery of Rowhammer attacks which give an adversary power to introduce bit flips in a victim's memory space. Numerous studies analyzed Rowhammer and proposed techniques to prevent it altogether or to mitigate its effects. In this work, we push the boundary and show how Rowhammer can be further exploited to inject faults into stack variables and even register values in a victim's process. We achieve this by targeting the register value that is stored in the process's stack, which subsequently is flushed out into the memory, where it becomes vulnerable to Rowhammer. When the faulty value is restored into the register, it will end up used in subsequent iterations. The register value can be stored in the stack via latent function calls in the source or by actively triggering signal handlers. We demonstrate the power of the findings by applying the techniques to bypass SUDO and SSH authentication. We further outline how MySQL and other cryptographic libraries can be targeted with the new attack vector. There are a number of challenges this work overcomes with extensive experimentation before coming together to yield an end-to-end attack on an OpenSSL digital signature: achieving co-location with stack and register variables, with synchronization provided via a blocking window. We show that stack and registers are no longer safe from the Rowhammer attack.}

	abstract = {Randomizing the mapping of addresses to cache entries has proven to be an effective technique for hardening caches against contention-based attacks like Prime+Probe. While attacks and defenses are still evolving, it is clear that randomized caches significantly increase the security against such attacks. However, one aspect that is missing from most analyses of randomized cache architectures is the choice of the replacement policy. Often, only the random- and LRU replacement policies are investigated. However, LRU is not applicable to randomized caches due to its immense hardware overhead, while the random replacement policy is not ideal from a performance and security perspective. In this paper, we explore replacement policies for randomized caches. We develop two new replacement policies and evaluate a total of five replacement policies regarding their security against Prime+Prune+Probe attackers. Moreover, we analyze the effect of the replacement policy on the system's performance and quantify the introduced hardware overhead. We implement randomized caches with configurable replacement policies in software and hardware using a custom cache simulator, gem5, and the CV32E40P RISC-V core. Among others, we show that the construction of eviction sets with our new policy, VARP-64, requires over 25-times more cache accesses than with the random replacement policy while also enhancing overall performance.}

	abstract = {Trusted execution environment (TEE) offers data protection against malicious system software. However, the TEE (e.g., Intel SGX) threat model exacerbates information leakage as attackers can enhance and denoise the observations from hardware-based side channels through controlled victim execution (i.e., replay). The replay mechanism is especially critical for side channels from physical traces (e.g., power consumption) that not only vary instantaneously but also necessitate successive modulation for observability. In this paper, we identify and characterize the key limitations of existing replay techniques for speculation attacks. Our study unveils that architectural support for transactional memory (i.e., Intel TSX) can be leveraged as a highly efficient replay primitive for transient execution. Based on this observation, we design TMPlayer, an efficient and high-resolution TSX-based replay framework for enclave victims. Built on top of TMPlayer, we present PowSpectre- a novel replay-based transient execution attack using software-based power side channels (via RAPL) that can exfiltrate secretive enclave data accurately in the speculative domain. We evaluate PowSpectre using case studies on several representative SGX binaries. Our evaluation shows that PowSpectre can exfiltrate unintended secrets in enclaves with very high accuracy. We perform a gadget analysis in SGX libraries and identify widely-existing code patterns that are power differentiable for PowSpectre. Our work highlights the need to synergistically understand the impact of speculation security with the introduction of new hardware functionalities.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry due to its merit of securely constructing AI models across multiple entities while preserving the privacy of local training data. However, recent research shows two persisting problems in FL that have yet to be solved: (1) limited practical adaptation of federated learning because of time-consuming conventional privacy-preserving methods, and (2) the absence of quantum-computing resistance in these methods. To address these problems, we propose a novel vertical federated learning strategy, HQsFL, which relies on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Matrix Vector Product basing on Coefficient Encoding. The proposed method can be widely applied to FL algorithms such as logistic regression and XGBoost, etc. We fully implement our approach and evaluate its utility and efficiency through extensive experiments performed on four synthetic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods for vertical LR and XGBoost achieve comparable levels of AUC to conventional methods, while significantly improving training efficiency and achieving security property of quantum-computing resistance.}

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency networks crucially rely on digital signature schemes, which are used as an authentication mechanism for transactions. Unfortunately, most major cryptocurrencies today, including Bit-coin and Ethereum, employ signature schemes that are susceptible to quantum adversaries, i.e., an adversary with access to a quantum computer can forge signatures and thereby spend coins of honest users. In cryptocurrency networks, signature schemes are typically not executed in isolation, but within a so-called cryptographic wallet. In order to achieve security against quantum adversaries, the signature scheme and the cryptographic wallet must withstand quantum attacks. In this work, we advance the study on post-quantum secure signature and wallet schemes. That is, we provide the first formal model for deterministic threshold wallets and we show a generic post-quantum secure construction from any post-quantum secure threshold signature scheme with rerandomizable keys. We then instantiate our construction from the isogeny-based signature scheme CSI-FiSh and we show that our instantiation significantly improves over prior work.}

	abstract = {Significant research efforts have been dedicated to designing cryptographic algorithms that are quantum-resistant. The motivation is clear: robust quantum computers, once available, will render current cryptographic standards vulnerable. Thus, we need new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, and, due to the inherent complexity of such algorithms, there is also a demand to accelerate them in hardware. In this paper, we show that PQC hardware accelerators can be backdoored by two different adversaries located in the chip supply chain. We propose REPQC, a sophisticated reverse engineering algorithm that can be employed to confidently identify hashing operations (i.e., Keccak) within the PQC accelerator - the location of which serves as an anchor for finding secret information to be leaked. Armed with REPQC, an adversary proceeds to insert malicious logic in the form of a stealthy Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH). Using Dilithium as a study case, our results demonstrate that HTHs that increase the accelerator's layout density by as little as 0.1% can be inserted without any impact on the performance of the circuit and with a marginal increase in power consumption. An essential aspect is that the entire reverse engineering in REPQC is automated, and so is the HTH insertion that follows it, empowering adversaries to explore multiple HTH designs and identify the most suitable one.}

	abstract = {Misuse resilience is an important research topic in the NIST PQC standardization process. Key mismatch attacks are a major type of misuse attack. In key mismatch attacks, the adversary aims to recover the reused secret key by sending special ciphertexts to the target party and observing whether the shared key matches his guesses or not. In this paper, we propose pairwise-parallel key mismatch attacks. The strategy is to recover partial information about multiple coefficient-pairs of the secret key in a parallel way per query. We realize the multi-value key mismatch oracle in a key exchange scenario and experimentally validate our proposed attacks. Our attacks greatly reduce the number of queries required to recover the full secret key. Specifically, compared with state-of-the-art key mismatch attacks on CPA-secure Kyber, our attacks reduce the number of queries by 95% with computational complexity of 232. Then we employ the post-processing with lattice reduction to further minimize the number of queries. The results show we only need 78 queries to recover the full secret key of Kyber1024 with a lattice reduction cost of 232. Moreover, our proposed pairwise-parallel attack method can be applied to improve the PC oracle-based SCA against CCA-secure Kyber, reducing the number of queries/traces by 16.67%. Futhermore, the proposed attacks can be applied to Saber and other lattice-based KEMs.}

	abstract = {The selection of parameters that offer best possible performance while simultaneously guaranteeing a well-defined level of security is one of the most challenging tasks in cryptographic system design. In order to ensure that the chosen parameters offer a certain level of security an estimation of the computational complexity of the underlying hard problem is required. To date, those estimations are often performed in an ad-hoc manner. This led to a scattered landscape of available estimation scripts, with multiple scripts for the same problem with varying outputs. In this work we present the first open-source software library entirely dedicated to cryptographic hardness estimation, the CryptographicEstimators library. In contrast to most previous estimators, this library follows a modern object-oriented software architecture, which provides a wide variety of features. Overall the design is optimized to ease extending existing estimators by new algorithms and makes it simple to integrate completely new estimators. We then showcase the functionality of the library by presenting estimates for selected candidates of the NIST PQC first round digital signature standardization effort. In this work we further specify the algorithmic cost model underlying the estimators. We then survey the state-of-the-art of concrete complexity estimation on six different hardness assumptions, including the syndrome decoding problem, the multivariate quadratic problem, the code equivalence problem, the permuted kernel problem and different flavors thereof. In this process we gathered and integrated estimators for all these assumptions, to provide a solid starting point for the project. Additionally, we normalized all estimates to fit into the cost model and to measure the same unit operations.}

	abstract = {Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) are an elementary building block in cryptographic and privacy-preserving applications. While there are numerous pre-quantum secure OPRF constructions, it is unclear which of the proposed options for post-quantum secure constructions are practical for modern-day applications. In this work, we focus on isogeny group actions, as the associated low bandwidth leads to efficient constructions. We introduce OPUS, a novel Naor-Reingold-based OPRF from isogenies without oblivious transfer, and show efficient evaluations of the Naor-Reingold PRF using CSIDH and CSI-FiSh. Additionally, we analyze a previous proposal of a CSIDH-based OPRF and that the straightforward instantiation of the protocol leaks the server's private key. As a result, we propose mitigations to address those shortcomings, which require additional hardness assumptions. Our results report a very competitive protocol when combined with lattices for Oblivious Transfer. Our evaluation shows that OPUS and the repaired, generic construction are competitive with other proposals in terms of runtime efficiency and communication size. More concretely, OPUS achieves almost two orders of magnitude less communication overhead compared to the next-best lattice-based OPRF at the cost of higher latency and higher computational cost, and the repaired construction. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of OPUS and the generic NR-OT in two use cases: first, we instantiate OPAQUE, a protocol for asymmetric authenticated key exchange. Compared to classical elliptic curve cryptography, which is considered insecure in the presence of efficient quantum computers, this results in less than 100 Ã— longer computation on average and around 1000Ã— more communication overhead. Second, we perform an unbalanced private set intersection and show that the communication overhead can be roughly the same when using isogenies or elliptic curves, at the cost of much higher runtime. Conversely, for sets of the size 210, we report a runtime around 200Ã— slower than the elliptic curve PSI. This concretizes the overhead of performing PSI and using OPAQUE with isogenies for the first time.}

	abstract = {Navigating the maze of contemporary organizational attack surfaces is paramount in fortifying our defenses against the relentless tide of cyber incidents. However, existing network reconnaissance and security measurements, which enumerate IP addresses or scan popular domains searching for vulnerabilities, capture only a fragmented view of the risk landscape, neglecting the nuanced reality of modern organizational assets. We experimentally show that such scans miss out on most assets of large organizations since they do not consider the increasingly complex IT architectures. We perform the first security analysis of the external attack surface of the 100-top enterprises in Europe. We discover the digital assets belonging to the enterprises and analyze the security of the services per 3 attack surface areas: (1) self-hosted on on-premises, (2) the services hosted on cloud, and (3) the services outsourced to external providers. The last one is usually shadowed under the traditional on-premises and the modern Cloud and has not been studied or compared to them. Our analysis shows that it is a large and significant part of the digital footprint of enterprises. In general, our analysis shows that organizations in different sectors have distinct IT architectures and are built differently, as a result, the security issues vary across the sectors. More importantly, for each sector, the security issues in each of the 3 areas differ from each other. This demonstrates the need for a more granular approach when analyzing organizations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations per sector per area. We also initiated a disclosure campaign notifying the enterprises of the identified vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {The security of the Internet and numerous other applications rests on a small number of open-source cryptographic libraries: A vulnerability in any one of them threatens to compromise a significant percentage of web traffic. Despite this potential for security impact, the characteristics and causes of vulnerabilities in cryptographic software are not well understood. In this work, we conduct the first systematic, longitudinal analysis of cryptographic libraries and the vulnerabilities they produce. We collect data from the National Vulnerability Database, individual project repositories and mailing lists, and other relevant sources for all widely used cryptographic libraries. In our investigation of the causes of these vulnerabilities, we find evidence of a correlation between the complexity of these libraries and their (in)security, empirically demonstrating the potential risks of bloated cryptographic codebases. Among our most interesting findings is that 48.4% of vulnerabilities in libraries written in C and C++ are either primarily caused or exacerbated by memory safety issues, indicating that systems-level bugs are a major contributor to security issues in these systems. Cryptographic design and implementation issues make up 27.5% of vulnerabilities across all libraries, with side-channel attacks providing a further 19.4%. We find substantial variation among core library components in both complexity levels and vulnerabilities produced: for instance, over one-third of vulnerabilities are located in implementations of the SSL/TLS protocols, providing actionable evidence for codebase quality and security improvements in these libraries.}

	abstract = {Adversaries have been targeting unique identifiers to launch typo-squatting, mobile app squatting and even voice squatting attacks. Anecdotal evidence suggest that online social networks (OSNs) are also plagued with accounts that use similar usernames. This can be confusing to users but can also be exploited by adversaries. However, to date no study characterizes this problem on OSNs. In this work, we define the username squatting problem and design the first multi-faceted measurement study to characterize it on X. We develop a username generation tool (UsernameCrazy) to help us analyze hundreds of thousands of username variants derived from celebrity accounts. Our study reveals that thousands of squatted usernames have been suspended by X, while tens of thousands that still exist on the network are likely bots. Out of these, a large number share similar profile pictures and profile names to the original account signalling impersonation attempts. We found that squatted accounts are being mentioned by mistake in tweets hundreds of thousands of times and are even being prioritized in searches by the network's search recommendation algorithm exacerbating the negative impact squatted accounts can have in OSNs. We use our insights and take the first step to address this issue by designing a framework (SQUAD) that combines UsernameCrazy with a new classifier to efficiently detect suspicious squatted accounts. Our evaluation of SQUAD's prototype implementation shows that it can achieve 94% F1-score when trained on a small dataset.}

This study expands the scope to include a comprehensive evaluation of client-side anti-phishing techniques within the Chrome browser, alongside an in-depth analysis of academic research in the field of phishing over the past five years. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of current client-side anti-phishing measures, which demonstrated a detection rate of only 14% for phishing websites and blocked merely 10% of login-based phishing sites within the first hour, resulting in a substantial false negative rate. Additionally, our analysis reveals that attackers can readily circumvent these defenses by altering the content of phishing websites. The study also critically assesses recent academic contributions to understand their alignment and potential integration with client-side anti-phishing frameworks. Based on these insights, we propose targeted recommendations to enhance the efficacy and responsiveness of the client-side anti-phishing ecosystem, addressing the challenges of low detection coverage, slow response times, and high rates of false negatives.}

	abstract = {Voice Personal Assistants (VPA) are becoming popular entry points to control connected devices in an IoT environment, e.g., by invoking Amazon Alexa voice-apps (called skills) to turn on/off lights through voice commands. Amazon Alexa platform allows third-party developers to build skills and publish them to marketplaces, which greatly extends the functionalities of VPA. Despite the many convenient features, there are increasing security and safety concerns about VPA-controlled IoT systems. Previous research demonstrated the prevalence of potentially malicious or problematic skills in the marketplace. However, existing works mainly focus on non-IoT skills (e.g., skills under the Kids and Health categories). The security and safety risks of IoT skills are largely under-explored. In this work, we discover new vulnerabilities in the Amazon Alexa platform, which allows malicious third-party developers to hijack Alexa's built-in voice commands to invoke malicious IoT skills. We present three new attacks hijacking Alexa's built-in IoT commands, including Command Invocation Confounding Attack, Custom Command Attack, and Command-Intent Hijacking Attack. We also find a vulnerability that allows arbitrary control of smart-home devices in the back-end code. We evaluate the success rate for each attack and prove that they can be used by malicious developers. In particular, we demonstrate that skills in the Connected Car category using Alexa's built-in intents can be hijacked by customized IoT skills. We also design and implement IoTSkillAnalyzer, a dynamic testing tool to examine IoT skills on the Alexa skills store. After analyzing 488 Alexa 3rd-party IoT skills using IoTSkillAnalyzer, we identified 52 skills with potential command hijacking attacks. We also found that 26 suspicious skills have hidden behaviors potentially caused by the Skill Back-end Code Manipulation vulnerability after they receive normal commands, such as failing to control devices, taking hidden actions, and providing wrong response information to users.}

	abstract = {Smart speakers such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, have significantly enhanced the convenience and efficiency of our daily lives, leading to widespread adoption globally. Subsequently, the voice commands directed at these devices contain a wealth of private information, encompassing users' daily routines, details about clinic visits, and even shopping habits. Security researchers have already identified vulnerabilities in encrypted network traffic, particularly in the context of traffic analysis, enabling the network-level adversaries to infer the websites visited by users. This security threat, common in traditional web communication, extends to voice query communication between the smart speaker and the server, giving rise to the concept of Voice Command Traffic Fingerprinting (VCF). In this paper, building upon recent literature on VCF, we strive to conduct a more comprehensive study. Our contributions include proposing a variant of WF features that empowers adversaries to outperform state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we consider variations in voice command traffic influenced by factors such as device locations and user characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a command category fingerprinting approach capable of inferring the voice command category even for unknown commands, presenting a more practical and scalable model. Through these contributions, we aim to advance the understanding of VCF by considering various practical factors influencing voice command traffic, and provide insights for the development of more robust defenses.}

	abstract = {IoT devices (e.g., voice assistants) that execute real-time speech commands are proliferating fast in our daily lives. In such a device, detecting the correct keyword spoken as a command triggers the supported function, and hence keyword spotting (KWS) using a machine learning (ML) model is the pivotal task in their functioning. However, KWS is vulnerable to adversarial machine learning (AML)-based attacks through which an adversary can craft an adversarial audio sample that sounds like a benign keyword to a human, but is detected as a different keyword by the KWS pipeline. In this paper, we propose SpotOn, a novel KWS pipeline that both recovers from AML attacks, as well as detects whether an attacker is using the device to generate AML noise. Using the Google speech command dataset, we demonstrate that SpotOn provides reasonable accuracy in correctly detecting keywords in the absence or presence of AML attacks. Through careful optimizations, we enable SpotOn to process streaming speech input on resource-constrained IoT devices. Overall, the design of SpotOn provides critical insights into making voice-controlled IoT devices suitable for safety-critical systems.}

	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy has established itself as one of the central protocols of the Internet of Things. Its many features (mobility, low energy consumption) make it an attractive protocol for smart devices. However, numerous critical vulnerabilities affecting BLE have been made public in recent years, some of which are linked to the protocol's design itself. The impossibility of correcting these vulnerabilities without affecting the specification requires the development of effective intrusion detection systems, enabling the detection and prevention of these threats. Unfortunately, the protocol relies on peer-to-peer communications and introduces many complex and dynamic mechanisms (e.g., channel hopping), making monitoring complex, costly and limited. Existing intrusion detection approaches lack flexibility, are limited in scope and introduce high deployment costs. In this paper, we explore a novel approach consisting in embedding an intrusion detection system directly within BLE controllers. This strategic position tackles these challenges by enabling a more advanced analysis and instrumentation of the protocol and opens the way to new defensive applications. We propose OASIS, a framework for injecting detection heuristics into controllers' firmwares in a generic way without affecting the normal operation of the protocol stack. It can be deployed in various contexts during the life cycle of a device, from the chip manufacturer to a software developer making use of proprietary components, or even in a full black box context by a security analyst to harden a commercial product. We describe its modular architecture and present its implementation within five of the most popular BLE chips from three different manufacturers, deployed in billions of devices and embedding heterogeneous protocol stacks. We present five modules for critical low-level protocol attack detection. We show that OASIS has a low impact on the controller performance (power, timing, memory) and evaluate its usage in a real-world setting.}

To improve the security of DDS, the Object Management Group formulated the DDS Security, which provides security mechanisms for DDS in the form of security plugins. However, the security of the DDS Security protocol has not been fully analyzed. We analyze DDS Security through formal methods. We model the security goals and protocol flow of the DDS Security using ProVerif and evaluate whether its security goals can be met in different scenarios. Our analysis confirms previously manually identified vulnerabilities in an automated way and reveals new attacks. We discovered the permission file impersonation attack, the denial of service attack, the degradation attack, and the privacy leakage attack guided by the formal analysis result. For these threats, we propose corresponding mitigation measures and recommendations.}

	abstract = {Estonia has been deploying electronic voting for its government elections since 2005. The underlying e-voting system and protocol have been continuously improved, aiming to fix the vulnerabilities found over the years and to provide election verifiability, which is now the standard way to ensure election integrity despite corrupt infrastructure or parties. Another goal is receipt-freeness, to ensure privacy even if voters are coerced. However, several recent attacks against its verifiability and privacy show the need of rigorous, realistic formal specifications for the protocol and its security, of new solutions to mitigate attacks, and of automated security proofs to ensure all attacks have been covered. In this paper we propose: â€¢ a formal specification of the Estonian E-Voting protocol in a symbolic model suited for automated verification tools; â€¢ a general symbolic model for specifying privacy and receipt-freeness in presence of corrupt parties and infrastructure; â€¢ automated verification of security with respect to an exhaustive set of corruption scenarios, discovering new attacks on verifiability (with Tamarin) and on privacy (with ProVerif). â€¢ new solutions, focused on practical deployment and ease of use, and their automated proofs of security.}

	abstract = {Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is one example of ranked-choice voting. It provides many known benefits when used in elections, such as minimising vote splitting, ensuring few votes are wasted, and providing resistance to strategic voting. However, the voting and tallying procedures for IRV are much more complicated than those of plurality and are both error-prone and tedious. Many automated systems have been proposed to simplify these procedures in IRV. Some of these also employ cryptographic techniques to protect the secrecy of ballots and enable verification of the tally. Nearly all of these cryptographic systems require a set of trustworthy tallying authorities (TAs) to perform the decryption of votes and/or running of mix servers, which adds significant complexity to the implementation and election management. We address this issue by proposing Camel: an E2E verifiable solution for IRV that requires no TAs. Camel employs a novel representation and a universally verifiable shifting procedure for ballots that facilitate the elimination of candidates as required in an IRV election. We combine these with a homomorphic encryption scheme and zero-knowledge proofs to protect the secrecy of the ballots and enable any party to verify the well-formedness of the ballots and the correctness of the tally in an IRV election. We examine the security of Camel and prove it maintains ballot secrecy by limiting the learned information (namely the tally) against a set of colluding voters.}

	abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 family of standards, better known as WiFi, is a widely used protocol utilized by billions of users. Previous works on WiFi formal verification have mostly focused on the four-way handshake and other security aspects. However, recent works have uncovered severe vulnerabilities in functional aspects of WiFi, which can cause information leakage for billions of devices. No formal analysis method exists able to reason on the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol. In this paper, we take the first steps in addressing this gap and present an extensive formal analysis of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol, more specifically, the fragmentation and the power-save-mode process. To achieve this, we design a novel segment-based formal verification process and introduce a practical threat model (i.e., MAC spoofing) in Tamarin to reason about the various capabilities of the attacker. To this end, we verify 68 properties extracted from WiFi protocol specification, find 3 vulnerabilities from the verification, verify 3 known attacks, and discover 2 new issues. These vulnerabilities and issues affect 14 commercial devices out of 17 tested cases, showing the prevalence and impact of the issues. Apart from this, we show that the proposed countermeasures indeed are sufficient to address the issues. We hope our results and analysis will help vendors adopt the countermeasures and motivate further research into the verification of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol.}

	abstract = {Browser extensions boost user experience on the web. Similarly to smartphone app stores, browsers like Chrome distribute browser extensions via their Web Store, enabling a thriving market of third-party developed extensions. The Web Store incorporates a user review system to help users decide which extensions to install. Unfortunately, the open nature of the review system is subject to reputation manipulation. As browser vendors fight reputation manipulation, attackers employ more sophisticated methods to stay under the radar. Focusing on fake reviews, we identify several techniques attackers use: fake accounts, disjoint sets of fake accounts for different extensions, automation of generated reviews, and focusing on reviews rather than ratings. We present FakeX, a framework to detect fake reviews by focusing on inference from review metadata. FakeX employs five distinct methods, including temporal distribution analysis, relationship clustering, and ratio-based assessments, to unveil patterns indicative of fake reviews. Evaluation of over 1.7 million reviews reveals the effectiveness of FakeX in identifying hundreds of fake review campaigns. Furthermore, our investigation of these fake reviews uncovers 86 malicious extensions, mounting attacks that range from data-stealing to monetization, impacting over 64 million users. In addition, we collaborate with Adblock Plus and Avast to demonstrate FakeX in action, expanding a seed list of newly detected malicious extensions to discover a further 16 malicious extensions with millions of users, where, in some cases, attackers tried to improve malicious code.}

	abstract = {This paper is the first attempt at providing a holistic view of the Chrome Web Store (CWS). We leverage historical data provided by ChromeStats to study global trends in the CWS and security implications. We first highlight the extremely short life cycles of extensions: roughly 60% of extensions stay in the CWS for one year. Second, we define and show that Security-Noteworthy Extensions (SNE) are a significant issue: they pervade the CWS for years and affect almost 350 million users. Third, we identify clusters of extensions with a similar code base. We discuss how code similarity techniques could be used to flag suspicious extensions. By developing an approach to extract URLs from extensions' comments, we show that extensions reuse code snippets from public repositories or forums, leading to the propagation of dated code and vulnerabilities. Finally, we underline a critical lack of maintenance in the CWS: 60% of the extensions in the CWS have never been updated; half of the extensions known to be vulnerable are still in the CWS and still vulnerable 2 years after disclosure; a third of extensions use vulnerable library versions. We believe that these issues should be widely known in order to pave the way for a more secure CWS.}

	abstract = {The modern web services landscape is characterized by numerous fine-grained, loosely coupled microservices with increasingly stringent low-latency requirements. However, this architecture also brings new performance vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-volume application layer DDoS attack called the Sync-Millibottleneck (SyncM) attack, specifically targeting microservices. The goal of this attack is to cause a long-tail latency problem that violates the service-level agreement (SLA) while evading state-of-the-art DDoS detection/defense mechanisms. The SyncM attack exploits two unique features of microservices architecture: (1) the shared frontend gateway that directs user requests to mid-tier/backend microservices, and (2) the co-existence of multiple logically independent execution paths, each with its own bottleneck resource. By creating synchronized millibottlenecks (i.e., sub-second duration bottlenecks) on multiple independent execution paths, SyncM attack can cause the queuing effect in each execution path to be propagated and superimposed in the shared frontend gateway. As a result, SyncM triggers surprisingly high latency spikes in the system, even when all system resources are far from saturation, making it challenging to trace the cause of performance instability. To evaluate the practicality of the SyncM attack, we conduct extensive experiments on real cloud systems such as EC2 and Azure, which are equipped with state-of-the-art IDS/IPS systems. We also conduct a large-scale simulation using a production Alibaba trace to show the scalability of our attack. Our results demonstrate that the SyncM attack is highly effective, as it only consumes less than 15% of additional CPU resources of the target system while increasing its 95th percentile response time by more than 20 times.}

	abstract = {Logging of security-relevant events is crucial in software development to gain visibility into the application\'s runtime, and to detect suspicious and malicious behavior. Various security guidelines (such as ISO 27002, CCM) mandate the software products to log certain security-relevant events for forensics purposes. In addition, security community (such as the OWASP Foundation) has come up with similar logging recommendations. On the other hand, the lack of sufficient and proper logging practices has been common in the software industry: In fact, "insufficient logging and monitoring" has been part of the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks for many years. In this paper, we address the issue of insufficient security logging by identifying the security-relevant logging requirements from multiple security guidelines, and by looking at real-world logging practices in a large set of open source Java web applications. We analyze six logging guidelines and identify more than 33K security-relevant logging statements from 472 applications, with respect to different event categories. We present several observations on the log density, positioning, severity levels, use of logging utilities, and the common motivations for security-relevant logs. Our results show that the handling of security logs is not differentiated from the rest of the logging activity, and the current practices are not sufficient to facilitate the detection and investigation of security related issues. Finally, we draw attention to the need for more practical logging guidelines and automated tools to support developers in logging decisions.}

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of mobile super apps, which consolidate a variety of services, including messaging, ride-hailing, and e-commerce, into a single application, eliminating the need to switch between different apps. Originally tailored for mobile usage, super apps like WeChat and WeCom have expanded their reach to desktop platforms, including Windows. However, different operating systems have different threat models (e.g., Windows can directly grant users with root privilege but Android and iOS do not). Therefore, the single super app (including both its host app and miniapps) can face completely different threats in different platforms. In this paper, we systematically study the attacks caused by the discrepancies from different platforms. Specifically, we show that there are at least two classes of attacks, dubbed RootFree attacks, against mobile super apps: layer below that attacks the super apps from privileged software, and layer up that attacks the super apps from the internal malicious miniapps. We have disclosed our attacks and the corresponding vulnerabilities to the host app vendor, and received bug bounties. These vulnerabilities all are ranked as high severity vulnerabilities, and some of them have already been patched.}

	abstract = {HTTP is everywhere, and a consistent interpretation of the protocol's specification is essential for interoperability and security. In 2022, after more than 30 years of evolution, the core HTTP specifications became an Internet Standard. However, apart from anecdotal evidence showing that HTTP installations violate parts of the specifications, no insights on the state of conformance of deployed HTTP systems exist. To close this knowledge gap, we systematically analyze the conformance landscape of HTTP systems with a focus on the potential security impact of rule violations. We extracted 106 falsifiable rules from HTTP specifications and created an HTTP conformance test suite. With our test suite, we tested nine popular web servers and 9,990 live web hosts. Our results show that the risk for security issues is high as most HTTP systems break at least one rule, and more than half of all rules were broken at least once. Based on our findings, we propose improvements, such as more conformance testing and less reliance on the robustness principle and instead explicitly defining error behavior.}

	abstract = {Phishing kits have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals because they offer an easy-to-use and efficient way for phishing attackers to build phishing websites. Prior work on phishing kits has focused on analyzing specific behavioral features (e.g., evasion techniques), and measuring their effectiveness on the anti-phishing mechanisms. Unfortunately, such prior studies provide a limited perspective, either targeting specific phishing kits or not fully addressing the server-side strategies at the script level that offer insights into the phishing attacker's view. In this paper, we systematically conduct a comprehensive study of phishing kits at the script level, aiming to better understand the server-side behavior. Particularly, we design a crawler that periodically (every 15 mins) collects phishing kits used in the wild and client-side resources of real-world phishing websites (e.g., index.html, images, CSS, JavaScript) for 18 months. We utilize two types of our collected dataset (4,153 phishing kits and 2.4M phishing webpages) for our study. First, we classify user interaction patterns based on information-exfiltrating components of phishing kits into three categories: single-stage (non-real-time) phishing, multi-stage (non-real-time) phishing, and multi-stage (real-time) phishing. We then identify the potential information leakage of each pattern. Next, we conduct an in-depth script-level analysis of the evasive behaviors in the kits. Aiming to evaluate their practical impact on the phishing sites, we also measure how many phishing kits are used and deployed with an emphasis on the chronological trends for phishing attacks by clustering the landing pages of phishing kits with those of our collected phishing websites. Lastly, we discuss the security implications of our comprehensive study on web interaction, URL patterns/redirection, and kit-deployment trends in the phishing detection literature.}

	abstract = {Popular consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide increasingly diverse sensing and actuation capabilities. Despite their benefits, such devices prompt numerous security concerns. Typically, security is attained at device-level granularity, which relies upon device trustworthiness. However, if a device is compromised (e.g., via remote exploits), this approach fails. To this end, we construct SA4P: Sensing and Actuation as a Privilege, a framework that decouples IoT devices from their physical environment. In SA4P, whenever any software on a device wants to access a sensing or actuation peripheral, it must be authorized to do so. This is achieved by the inclusion of an on-board component, Peripheral Guard (PEG), that physically guards peripherals. Besides providing strong security guarantees, SA4P motivates developers to consider sensing and actuation as valuable resources. SA4P' design is modular, lightweight, and formally verified. It also does not require any hardware modifications for trusted execution environment (TEE)-equipped devices, while imposing only modest changes for other devices.}

	abstract = {With the rise in the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), security concerns associated with them have become paramount. Similar to other cyber-physical systems, the primary working principle behind UAVs follows the sensor-controller-actuation cycle. Errors between the setpoints and sensor data are computed through a PID controller and translated to pulse width modulated (PWM) signals that control the orientation and movement of a UAV. Recent research has demonstrated intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI)-based alteration of PWM signals causing unauthorized maneuvers and crashes in UAVs. PWM alteration attacks can be carried out in various ways. For instance, hardware Trojans (HTs) can manipulate the PWM signals, and given the untrusted supply chain, HTs are a critical threat. Adversaries can exploit the PWM signals to manipulate UAV operations subtly, bypassing traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that only monitor sensor data. Therefore, ensuring the integrity of PWM signals and their correlation with sensor and controller data is crucial for end-to-end UAV security. We address this need by proposing ConFIDe (Control-Fused Intrusion Detection system), a novel defense technique for UAVs. It verifies the integrity of the flight controller-generated PWM signals, ensuring the motors receive the signals free from hidden exploits. We validated our proposed IDS on different PWM alteration attack scenarios. In particular, we implemented a hardware Trojan attack targeting the PWM signals on a PX4-UAV to test the efficacy of the proposed IDS on a real system. ConFIDe performed well on all the attack scenarios, achieving a high ROC-AUC, including sensor attacks like GPS spoofing.}

	abstract = {The number of applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (aka drones) is rapidly expanding. However, the wireless and broadcast nature of communications between the drones and their operators (i.e., Ground control station (GCS)) presents a risk for this channel to be exploited by outsiders. Specifically, an attacker can abuse benign communications as a cover to leak sensitive drone data secretly to nearby adversaries within the transmission range of a drone. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the threat of information leakage through MAVLink, a drone control protocol that is widely used in the majority of drone autopilot systems and is considered a de-facto standard. We show that multiple covert channels can be created in MAVLink by exploiting its lack of security mechanisms, default broadcast messages, and redundant features. We design and implement the novel covert channels on a realistic drone testbed in practical settings and assess their feasibility. Our extensive results demonstrate that attackers can effectively exfiltrate different types of sensitive data from drones with a high throughput via MAVLink-based covert channels in the presence of an active warden at the GCS. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of several countermeasures for MAVLink-based covert channels to improve the protocol's security. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploiting the popular MAVLink protocol for covert communications and demonstrating how it can be manipulated by the adversary for secret communications over commodity drones.}

	abstract = {Sensors are crucial for perception and autonomous operation in robotic vehicles (RV). Unfortunately, RV sensors can be compromised by physical attacks such as sensor tampering or spoofing. In this paper, we present DeLorean, a unified framework for attack detection, attack diagnosis, and recovering RVs from sensor deception attacks (SDA). DeLorean can recover RVs even from strong SDAs in which the adversary targets multiple heterogeneous sensors simultaneously. We propose a novel attack diagnosis technique that inspects the attack-induced errors under SDAs, and identifies the targeted sensors using causal analysis. DeLorean then uses historic state information to selectively reconstruct physical states for compromised sensors, enabling targeted attack recovery under single or multi-sensor SDAs. We evaluate DeLorean on four real and two simulated RVs under SDAs targeting various sensors, and we find that it successfully recovers RVs from SDAs in 93% of the cases.}

	abstract = {To prevent the mischievous use of synthetic (fake) point clouds produced by generative models, we pioneer the study of detecting point cloud authenticity and attributing them to their sources. We propose an attribution framework FakePCD to attribute (fake) point clouds to their respective generative models (or real-world collections). The main idea of FakePCD is to train an attribution model that learns the point cloud features from different sources and further differentiates these sources using an attribution signal. Depending on the characteristics of the training point clouds, namely, sources and shapes, we formulate four attribution scenarios: close-world, open-world, single-shape, and multiple-shape, and evaluate FakePCD's performance in each scenario. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FakePCD on source attribution across different scenarios. Take the open-world attribution as an example, FakePCD attributes point clouds to known sources with an accuracy of 0.82-0.98 and to unknown sources with an accuracy of 0.73-1.00. Additionally, we introduce an approach to visualize unique patterns (fingerprints) in point clouds associated with each source. This explains how FakePCD recognizes point clouds from various sources by focusing on distinct areas within them. Overall, we hope our study establishes a baseline for the source attribution of (fake) point clouds.1}

	abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are crucial devices for implementing automated control in various industrial control systems (ICS), such as smart power grids, water treatment systems, manufacturing, and transportation systems. Owing to their importance, PLCs are often the target of cyber attackers that are aiming at disrupting the operation of ICS, including the nation's critical infrastructure, by compromising the integrity of control logic execution. While a wide range of cybersecurity solutions for ICS have been proposed, they cannot counter strong adversaries with a foothold on the PLC devices, which could manipulate memory, I/O interface, or PLC logic itself. These days, many ICS devices in the market, including PLCs, run on ARM-based processors, and there is a promising security technology called ARM TrustZone, to offer a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on embedded devices. Envisioning that such a hardware-assisted security feature becomes available for ICS devices in the near future, this paper investigates the application of the ARM TrustZone TEE technology for enhancing the security of PLC. Our aim is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the TEE-based PLCs through the proof-of-concept design and implementation using open-source software such as OP-TEE and OpenPLC. Our evaluation assesses the performance and resource consumption in real-world ICS configurations, and based on the results, we discuss bottlenecks in the OP-TEE secure OS towards a large-scale ICS and desired changes for its application on ICS devices. Our implementation is made available to public for further study and research.}

	abstract = {Industrial control systems increasingly rely on middlebox functionality such as intrusion detection or in-network processing. However, traditional end-to-end security protocols interfere with the necessary access to in-flight data. While recent work on middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocols for the traditional Internet promises to address the dilemma between end-to-end security guarantees and middleboxes, the current state-of-the-art lacks critical features for industrial communication. Most importantly, industrial settings require fine-grained access control for middleboxes to truly operate in a least-privilege mode. Likewise, advanced applications even require that middleboxes can inject specific messages (e.g., emergency shutdowns). Meanwhile, industrial scenarios often expose tight latency and bandwidth constraints not found in the traditional Internet. As the current state-of-the-art misses critical features, we propose Middlebox-aware DTLS (Madtls), a middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocol specifically tailored to the needs of industrial networks. Madtls provides bit-level read and write access control of middleboxes to communicated data with minimal bandwidth and processing overhead, even on constrained hardware.}

	abstract = {The Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has been rapidly expanding to keep up with the increased demands of EV consumers. This government-backed infrastructure expansion resulted in the rushed integration of a significant number of insecure EV Charging Stations (EVCS), which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Motivated by the uncovered vulnerabilities in different components of the EV charging infrastructure, in this paper, we study the security of the EVCS Cloud Management System (CMS). Specifically, we focus on the (in)security of the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) backend communication with the EVCS. We verified the prevalence of such security weaknesses by discovering 6 zero-day vulnerabilities in each of the 16 representative live EV charging management systems. Our findings highlight the insecurity of the OCPP backend, which is widely deployed on existing EVCSs in the wild. Indeed, we discuss various attack scenarios that lead to man-in-the-middle, denial of service, firmware theft, and data poisoning, to name a few. We also leverage the developed testbed to demonstrate the feasibility of launching switching attacks against the power grid using compromised EVCSs. Finally, we contribute to the security of the EV charging ecosystem by also recommending countermeasures to mitigate/prevent future cyber-attacks.}

However, its limitation lies in processing only those elements present in every participant's set, which proves inadequate in scenarios where certain elements are common to several, but not all, sets. In this paper, we introduce an innovative variant of the mPSI protocol named unbalanced quorum PSI to fill in the gaps of the mPSI protocol. Unlike the previous quorum-PSI proposals which detect elements present in at least k out of n equal sets, our protocol is particularly tailored for unbalanced cases where the size of the receiver's set is much smaller than the size of the senders' sets. Our work achieves logarithmic communication complexity in the semi-honest setting, significantly surpassing previous work in efficiency. The benchmarks show that it takes 22.7 seconds in WAN and 14.7 seconds in LAN for online computation, and only 87.8 MB of total communication to intersect 5535 elements across 15 sets, each containing 224 elements. Compared to prior work, this is roughly an 87Ã— reduction in communication and a 31Ã— reduction in online time. Our protocols can be easily extended to the larger set with 228 elements which is nearly impractical for prior work.}

	abstract = {Decoy accounts are often used as an indicator of the compromise of sensitive data, such as password files. An attacker targeting only specific known-to-be-real accounts might, however, remain undetected. A more effective method proposed by Juels and Rivest at CCS'13 is to maintain additional fake passwords associated with each account. An attacker who gains access to the password file is unable to tell apart real passwords from fake passwords, and the attempted usage of a false password immediately sets off an alarm indicating a password file compromise. Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) has long been recognised for its strong security guarantees when it comes to low-entropy password authentication and secure channel establishment, without having to rely on the setup of a PKI. In this paper, we introduce SweetPAKE, a new cryptographic primitive that offers the same security guarantees as PAKE for key exchange, while allowing clients with a single password to authenticate against servers with n candidate passwords for that account and establish a secure channel. Additional security properties are identified and formalized to ensure that (a) high-entropy session keys are indistinguishable from random, even if later on the long-term secret password becomes corrupted (forward secrecy); (b) upon password file leakage, an adversary cannot tell apart real from fake passwords; and (c) a malicious client cannot trigger a false alarm. We capture these properties by extending well-established game-based definitions of PAKE. Furthermore, we propose a new UC formulation that comprehensively unifies both SweetPAKE (session key indistinguishability and sugarword indistinguishability) and a related notion known as Oblivious-PAKE. Finally, we propose efficient SweetPAKE and Oblivious-PAKE protocols constructed from Password-Authenticated Public-Key Encryption (PAPKE) that satisfy all the proposed notions.}

	abstract = {To enable common users to capitalize on the power of deep learning, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has been proposed in the literature, which opens powerful deep learning models of service providers to the public. To protect the data privacy of end users, as well as the model privacy of the server, several state-of-the-art privacy-preserving MLaaS frameworks have also been proposed. Nevertheless, despite the exquisite design of these frameworks to enhance computation efficiency, the computational cost remains expensive for practical applications. To improve the computation efficiency of deep learning (DL) models, model pruning has been adopted as a strategic approach to remarkably compress DL models. However, for practical deep neural networks, a problem called pruning structure inflation significantly limits the pruning efficiency, as it can seriously hurt the model accuracy. In this paper, we propose MOSAIC, a highly flexible pruning framework, to address this critical challenge. By first pruning the network with the carefully selected basic pruning units, then assembling the pruned units into suitable HE Pruning Structures through smart channel transformations, MOSAIC achieves a high pruning ratio while avoiding accuracy reduction, eliminating the problem plagued by the pruning structure inflation. We apply MOSAIC to popular DL models such as VGG and ResNet series on classic datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSAIC effectively and flexibly conducts pruning on those models, significantly reducing the Perm, Mult, and Add operations to achieve the global cost reduction without any loss in accuracy. For instance, in VGG-16 on Tiny ImageNet, the total cost is reduced to 21.14% and 29.49% under the MLaaS frameworks GAZELLE and CrypTFlow2, respectively.}

	abstract = {We introduce the LightPIR family, a new series of single-server PIR protocols with reduced overhead in terms of storage, communication, and computation. The protocols rely on a new GSW-like homomorphic cryptosystem based on the Ring Learning with Rounding (RLWR) problem and several ciphertext conversion algorithms for matrix encoding. Our RLWR-based techniques offer considerable advantages across all evaluation metrics compared to the previous state-of-the-art, the Spiral family (S&P 2022), under various database configurations. On the server, the LightPIR family simultaneously achieves a 1.2--1.8Ã— increase in the throughput and up to a 1.4Ã— increase in the rate while reducing the storage requirements of public parameters by 1.6--5Ã—. For the client, the LightPIR family eliminates the Gaussian noise sampling, resulting in an average 36% reduction in query encryption time and resilience against side-channel attacks. Meanwhile, communication efficiency between the client and server is also enhanced by a reduction of up to 3.8Ã— in query size and up to 1.8Ã— in response size. All the optimizations indicate that our constructions are more lightweight for both the client and the server, highlighting a new practical scenario where RLWR-based schemes can showcase their advantages.}

	abstract = {Chameleon hash (CH) function differs from a classical hash function in a way that a collision can be found with the knowledge of a trapdoor secret key. CH schemes have been used in various cryptographic applications such as sanitizable signatures and redactable blockchains. In this work, we reconstruct CH to ensure advanced security and usability. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we propose the first CH scheme, which supports full security, meaning the inclusion of both full indistinguishability and full collision-resistance. These two properties are required in the strongest CH security model in the literature. We achieve this by our innovative design of removing the CH public key during the computation of the hash value. Second, we investigate the security of CH in the multi-party setting and introduce the new properties of claimability and deniability under this setting. Third, we present and implement two instantiations of our CH scheme: an ECC-based one and a post-quantum lattice-based one. Our implementation demonstrates their practicality. Finally, we discuss the possible use cases in the blockchain.}

	abstract = {A Key Derivation Function (KDF) generates a uniform and highly random key-stream from weakly random key material. KDFs are broadly used in various security protocols such as digital signatures and key exchange protocols. HKDF, the most deployed KDF in practice, is based on the extract-then-expand paradigm. It is presently used, among others, in the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encrypted messaging. HKDF is a generic KDF for general input sources and thus is not optimized for source-specific use cases such as key derivation from Diffie-Hellman (DH) sources (i.e. DH shared secrets as key material). Furthermore, the sequential HKDF design is unnecessarily slow on some general-purpose platforms that can benefit from parallelization. In this work, we propose a novel, efficient and secure KDF called Skye. Skye follows the extract-then-expand paradigm and consists of two algorithms: efficient deterministic randomness extractor and expander functions. Instantiating our extractor for dedicated source-specific (e.g. DH sources) inputs leads to a significant efficiency gain over HKDF while maintaining its security level. We provide concrete security analysis of Skye and both its underlying algorithms in the standard model. We provide a software performance comparison of Skye with the AES-based expanding PRF ButterKnife and HKDF with SHA-256 (as used in practice). Our results show that in isolation Skye performs from 4x to 47x faster than HKDF, depending on the availability of AES or SHA instruction support. We further demonstrate that with such a performance gain, when Skye is integrated within the current Signal implementation, we can achieve significant overall improvements ranging from 38% to 64% relative speedup in unidirectional messaging. Even in bidirectional messaging, that includes DH computation with dominating computational cost, Skye still contributes to 12-36% relative speedup when just 10 messages are sent and received at once.}

	abstract = {Analyzing common neighbors between node pairs in social networks provides valuable insights into the graph structure and enables a range of network analytics tasks. In this paper, we investigate techniques to publish the histogram of common neighbor counts between all node pairs in a social network under edge-differential privacy. This problem is particularly challenging, since the histogram of common neighbor counts has a high sensitivity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in a social network. If we inject noise into the histogram in proportion to this sensitivity to achieve edge differential privacy, then the noise would overwhelm the signals of the histogram, since each node pair can have at most n - 2 common neighbors. Existing techniques address this issue by converting the histogram publication problem to an integer partition problem that has sensitivity of O(1), but these techniques tend to yield unsatisfactory data utility as they fail to take into account the characteristics of real social networks. To remedy the deficiency of existing methods, we propose a novel multi-stage approach that partitions the common neighbor count histogram into segments with controlled sensitivities lower than the global one, by exploiting the observation that common neighbor counts tend to follow a long-tail distribution: a small percentage of node pairs have large numbers of common neighbors while the remaining vast majority of pairs only have a few. We develop a utility-based technique to derive the optimal partition points. We conduct extensive experiments over several real social network datasets to validate our approach and evaluate the trade-offs of different design choices in our approach.

Among these advancements, distributed learning, specifically federated learning (FL), emerges as a significant shift in collaborative intelligence. FL's unique ability to leverage decentralized data sources promises innovation and privacy protection for local datasets across diverse domains, including healthcare, finance, object recognition, and beyond. However, despite its potential benefits, FL has shown to be vulnerable to various threats. From poisoning attacks to adversarial perturbations and information inference, malicious actors pose significant challenges to the integrity of FL systems. Effectively addressing these vulnerabilities requires the implementation of security-by-design principles within FL frameworks. In this talk, we steer through the complex landscape of FL attacks and defenses, shedding light on the ongoing arms race between adversaries and defenders. We examine their advantages and drawbacks, gaining valuable insights into the evolving nature of these threats. We conclude by outlining research challenges and directions to enhance the resilience and security of FL systems.}

	abstract = {JSON is a widely used format for representing data on the Internet. Unfortunately, the format is imprecisely specified, which poses the risk of confusion and ambiguity when processing sensitive data. While previous work has focused on manual analysis of parsers, an automatic analysis of the interplay of multiple parsers resulting from this imprecision has received little attention so far. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a framework for differential testing of JSON parsers tailored towards discovering semantic discrepancies. To spot these differences automatically, we overcome two challenges: First, we introduce a consensus-based normalization of JSON that enables us to analyze data semantics in absence of a precise specification. Second, we propose a novel mechanism for tracking test coverage across runtime environments, so that confusions between parsers written in C, C++, Rust, Java, and Python can be detected simultaneously. In a comparative analysis of 22 JSON parsers, we uncover various semantic discrepancies, ranging from minor inconsistencies in the representation of numbers and strings to severe confusions in the handling of object keys and values. We illustrate the security impact of these discrepancies in different case studies, echoing recent efforts to enforce a stricter specification for JSON in security applications.}

	abstract = {Security advisories are the primary channel of communication for discovered vulnerabilities in open-source software, but they often lack crucial information. Specifically, 63% of vulnerability database reports are missing their patch links, also referred to as vulnerability fixing commits (VFCs). This paper introduces VFCFinder, a tool that generates the top-five ranked set of VFCs for a given security advisory using Natural Language Programming Language (NL-PL) models. VFCFinder achieves a 96.6% recall for finding the correct VFC within the Top-5 commits, and an 80.0% recall for the Top-1 ranked commit. VFCFinder generalizes to nine different programming languages and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 36 percentage points in terms of Top-1 recall. As a practical contribution, we used VFCFinder to backfill over 300 missing VFCs in the GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) database. All of the VFCs were accepted and merged into the GHSA database. In addition to demonstrating a practical pairing of security advisories to VFCs, our general open-source implementation will allow vulnerability database maintainers to drastically improve data quality, supporting efforts to secure the software supply chain.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has enabled remarkable progress in binary code analysis. In particular, pre-trained embeddings of assembly code have become a gold standard for solving analysis tasks, such as measuring code similarity or recognizing functions. These embeddings are capable of learning a vector representation from unlabeled code. In contrast to natural language processing, however, label information is not scarce for many tasks in binary code analysis. For example, labeled training data for function boundaries, optimization levels, and argument types can be easily derived from debug information provided by a compiler. Consequently, the main motivation of embeddings does not transfer directly to binary code analysis. In this paper, we explore the role of pre-trained embeddings from a critical perspective. To this end, we systematically evaluate recent embeddings for assembly code on five downstream tasks using a corpus of 1.2 million functions from the Debian distribution. We observe that several embeddings perform similarly when sufficient labeled data is available, and that differences reported in prior work are hardly noticeable. Surprisingly, we find that end-to-end learning without pre-training performs best on average, which calls into question the need for specialized embeddings. By varying the amount of labeled data, we eventually derive guidelines for when embeddings offer advantages and when end-to-end learning is preferable for binary code analysis.}

	abstract = {Kernel memory allocators maintain several metadata structures optimized for efficiently managing system memory. However, existing implementations adopt either weak or no protection at all to ensure the integrity of said metadata in the presence of memory errors. In this paper, we first demonstrate how existing memory hardening schemes fall short against several in-kernel memory corruption scenarios. We then present ISLAB: a set of novel (slab-based) heap hardening techniques that aim to ensure the integrity of the memory managed by the kernel, and minimize the incurred runtime, and memory, overhead. ISLAB prevents memory corruption exploits by segregating metadata from within corruptible memory objects into shadow memory. It also relies on a novel SMAP-assisted memory isolation framework, called kSMAP, to protect allocator metadata against adversaries with stronger memory access capabilities. We implemented and evaluated ISLAB atop SLUB, the default slab allocator in Linux, and equipped it with kSMAP to protect process credentials, a popular target in kernel exploitation. Our experiments show that ISLAB incurs no runtime overhead in realistic benchmarks, and moderate overhead in stress tests. Lastly, we show how ISLAB's approach can be generalized to protect the integrity of other kernel subsystems that use corruptible metadata for memory management, such as linked lists.}

	abstract = {Memory safety bugs in C/C++ persist as significant security issues despite extensive research and attempted mitigations. Current detection frameworks use complex runtime metadata structures which greatly impact the overall performance by increasing execution runtime and memory consumption. This work introduces Dynamic Memory Tagging Instrumentation (DMTI), utilizing the ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to efficiently detect memory errors in precompiled binaries with no check instrumentation during runtime. Our method, implemented through the Ghidra and DynamoRIO frameworks uses a two-step approach to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. In an analysis step, an object layout for each function inside a binary is generated. Then, during runtime, dynamic instrumentation is used to enable MTE and insert instructions to manage the necessary object metadata, which allows automatic detection of memory violations. Compared to previous approaches, the removal of the check logic leads to substantial performance gains, which we demonstrate in our prototype evaluation. DMTI exhibits superior efficiency with an average runtime overhead of only 2Ã— compared to 10Ã— for state-of-the-art memory checking frameworks.}

	abstract = {A timely software update is vital to combat the increasing security vulnerabilities. However, some software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without creating CVE entries or even describing the security issue in their change log. Thus, it is critical to identify these hidden security patches and defeat potential N-day attacks. Researchers have employed various machine learning techniques to identify security patches in open-source software, leveraging the syntax and semantic features of the software changes and commit messages. However, all these solutions cannot be directly applied to the binary code, whose instructions and program flow may dramatically vary due to different compilation configurations. In this paper, we propose BinGo, a new security patch detection system for binary code. The main idea is to present the binary code as code property graphs to enable a comprehensive understanding of program flow and perform a language model over each basic block of binary code to catch the instruction semantics. BinGo consists of four phases, namely, patch data pre-processing, graph extraction, embedding generation, and graph representation learning. Due to the lack of an existing binary security patch dataset, we construct such a dataset by compiling the pre-patch and post-patch source code of the Linux kernel. Our experimental results show BinGo can achieve up to 80.77% accuracy in identifying security patches between two neighboring versions of binary code. Moreover, BinGo can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives caused by the different compilers and optimization levels.}

	abstract = {Binary reverse engineering is crucial to gaining insights into the inner workings of a stripped binary. Yet, it is challenging to read the original semantics from a binary code snippet because of the unavailability of high-level information in the source, such as function names, variable names, and types. Recent advancements in deep learning show the possibility of recovering such vanished information with a well-trained model from a pre-defined dataset. Albeit a static model's notable performance, it can hardly cope with an ever-increasing data stream (e.g., compiled binaries) by nature. The two viable approaches for ceaseless learning are retraining the whole dataset from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained model; however, retraining suffers from large computational overheads and fine-tuning from performance degradation (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). Lately, continual learning (CL) tackles the problem of handling incremental data in security domains (e.g., network intrusion detection, malware detection) using reasonable resources while maintaining performance in practice. In this paper, we focus on how CL assists in the improvement of a generative model that predicts a function symbol name from a series of machine instructions. To this end, we introduce BinAdapter, a system that can infer function names from an incremental dataset without performance degradation from an original dataset by leveraging CL techniques. Our major finding shows that incremental tokens in the source (i.e., machine instructions) or the target (i.e., function names) largely affect the overall performance of a CL-enabled model. Accordingly, BinAdapter adopts three built-in approaches: [EQUATION] inserting adapters in case of no incremental tokens in both the source and target, [EQUATION] harnessing multilingual neural machine translation (M-NMT) and fine-tuning the source embeddings with [EQUATION] in case of incremental tokens in the source, and [EQUATION] fine-tuning target embeddings with [EQUATION] in case of incremental tokens in both. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BinAdapter, we evaluate the above three scenarios using incremental datasets with or without a set of new tokens (e.g., unseen machine instructions or function names), spanning across different architectures and optimization levels. Our empirical results show that BinAdapter outperforms the state-of-the-art CL techniques for an F1 of up to 24.3% or a Rouge-l of 21.5% in performance.}

	abstract = {Over the past decade, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel have more than doubled, allowing control-flow hijacking attacks that compromise the entire system. To thwart these attacks, Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) has emerged as state-of-the-art. However, existing kernel CFI schemes are still limited in providing protection against these attacks, e.g., during system events and for return addresses. In this paper, we introduce Hardware-Enforced Kernel Control-Flow Integrity (HEK-CFI), a novel approach that protects control-flow-related data during system events, as well as function pointers and return addresses, effectively mitigating control-flow hijacking attacks. HEK-CFI leverages Intel CET, specifically write-protected pages used by its shadow stack design, along with signature-based CFI to safeguard this data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implement a proof-of-concept and perform a case study on the Linux kernel v5.18. In our case study, HEK-CFI eliminates all illegal backward-edge targets and reduces forward-edge targets by more than 50% compared to all existing kernel CFI schemes. We evaluate our proof-of-concept on real hardware and observe a performance overhead of 12.3% for micro benchmarks and 1.85% for macro benchmarks. In summary, HEK-CFI is the first solution to provide protection for both system events and return addresses. HEK-CFI also generically reduces forward control-flow targets and the performance overhead compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Model extraction (ME) attacks represent one major threat to Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms by "stealing" the functionality of confidential machine-learning models through querying black-box APIs. Over seven years have passed since ME attacks were first conceptualized in the seminal work [75]. During this period, substantial advances have been made in both ME attacks and MLaaS platforms, raising the intriguing question: How has the vulnerability of MLaaS platforms to ME attacks been evolving? In this work, we conduct an in-depth study to answer this critical question. Specifically, we characterize the vulnerability of current, mainstream MLaaS platforms to ME attacks from multiple perspectives including attack strategies, learning techniques, surrogatemodel design, and benchmark tasks. Many of our findings challenge previously reported results, suggesting emerging patterns of ME vulnerability. Further, by analyzing the vulnerability of the same MLaaS platforms using historical datasets from the past four years, we retrospectively characterize the evolution of ME vulnerability over time, leading to a set of interesting findings. Finally, we make suggestions about improving the current practice of MLaaS in terms of attack robustness. Our study sheds light on the current state of ME vulnerability in the wild and points to several promising directions for future research.}

	abstract = {The growing popularity of Machine Learning (ML) has led to its deployment in various sensitive domains, which has resulted in significant research focused on ML security and privacy. However, in some applications, such as Augmented/Virtual Reality, integrity verification of the outsourced ML tasks is more critical-a facet that has not received much attention. Existing solutions, such as multi-party computation and proof-based systems, impose significant computation overhead, which makes them unfit for real-time applications. We propose Fides, a novel framework for real-time integrity validation of ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) inference. Fides features a novel and efficient distillation technique-Greedy Distillation Transfer Learning-that dynamically distills and fine-tunes a space and compute-efficient verification model for verifying the corresponding service model while running inside a trusted execution environment. Fides features a client-side attack detection model that uses statistical analysis and divergence measurements to identify, with a high likelihood, if the service model is under attack. Fides also offers a re-classification functionality that predicts the original class whenever an attack is identified. We devised a generative adversarial network framework for training the attack detection and re-classification models. The evaluation shows that Fides achieves an accuracy of up to 98% for attack detection and 94% for re-classification.}

	abstract = {Personalized location recommendation allows users to enjoy a seamless travel experience by suggesting the optimal travel locations/routes based on user preferences. Most service providers collect users' location data centrally to develop accurate route recommendation applications. Federated learning (FL) can be used as an inherent privacy-preserving mechanism in these applications to prevent users from sharing private data. However, recent research shows that FL is still vulnerable to privacy leakages. Therefore, many FL-based recommendation systems use Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to defend against such attacks. In this paper, we propose the Visited Location Inference Attack (VLIA), a novel attack for federated location recommendation systems through the lens of Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Specifically, we focus on inferring user behaviour data (visited locations) even when the federated recommendation system is protected with LDP. We design and implement VLIA leveraging both embedding and proximity information of locations, making the inference more accurate. Our extensive experiments with two state-of-the-art personalized route recommendation (PRR) systems implemented in the FL setting and two real-world trajectory datasets showcase the effectiveness of the VLIA attack. Our results show that LDP cannot defend VLIA unless the recommendation performance is significantly compromised.}

	abstract = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems take audio signals as inputs and output the corresponding text transcriptions. The text is then used to execute commands and perform searches in several application domains, including security-critical applications such as smartphone assistants, smart home assistants, and self-driving car assistants. Signal processing attacks are one of the most recent types of attacks designed to fool ASR models. Signal processing attacks exploit the feature extraction stage of the ASR pipeline and add perturbations to the audio. These attacks are capable of generating wrong transcriptions of the audio signals even though the attacked audio sounds similar to the original audio. Existing defences for adversarial attacks are neural networks that act as a filter to remove attacks from audio waveforms. The heuristic-based training objective function used in training these filter networks has a negative impact on the performance. Also, there is a disconnect between the training objective function and the application objective function. We address these problems and propose a novel self-supervised fine-tuning algorithm to make existing ASR models robust to adversarial attacks. We do extensive experimentation on our method against signal processing attacks across four different scenarios, and in three out of four scenarios, our method exhibits the best results.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning technique where multiple clients train a shared model on their private datasets without sharing the data. While offering advantages, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where attackers insert malicious model updates into the model aggregation process. Compromised models predict attacker-chosen targets when presented with specific attacker-defined inputs. Backdoor defences generally rely on anomaly detection techniques based on Differential Privacy (DP) or require legitimate clean test examples at the server. Anomaly detection-based defences can be defeated by stealth techniques and generally require inspection of client-submitted model updates. DP-based approaches tend to degrade the performance of the trained model due to excessive noise addition during training. Methods that require legitimate clean data on the server require strong assumptions about the task and may not be applicable in real-world settings. In this work, we view the question of backdoor attack robustness through the lens of loss function optimal points to build a defence that overcomes these limitations. We propose Mode Connectivity Based Federated Learning (MCFL), which leverages the recently discovered property of neural network loss surfaces, mode connectivity. We simulate backdoor attack scenarios using computer vision benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, Fashion MNIST, MNIST, and Federated EMNIST. Our findings show that MCFL converges to high-quality models and effectively mitigates backdoor attacks relative to baseline defences from the literature without requiring inspection of client model updates or assuming clean data at the server.}

	abstract = {The increasing trend of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation raises the question of their capability to generate trustworthy code. While many researchers are exploring the utility of code generation for uncovering software vulnerabilities, one crucial but often overlooked aspect is the security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs play an integral role in upholding software security, yet effectively integrating security APIs presents substantial challenges. This leads to inadvertent misuse by developers, thereby exposing software to vulnerabilities. To overcome these challenges, developers may seek assistance from LLMs. In this paper, we systematically assess ChatGPT's trustworthiness in code generation for security API use cases in Java. To conduct a thorough evaluation, we compile an extensive collection of 48 programming tasks for 5 widely used security APIs. We employ both automated and manual approaches to effectively detect security API misuse in the code generated by ChatGPT for these tasks. Our findings are concerning: around 70% of the code instances across 30 attempts per task contain security API misuse, with 20 distinct misuse types identified. Moreover, for roughly half of the tasks, this rate reaches 100%, indicating that there is a long way to go before developers can rely on ChatGPT to securely implement security API code.}

	abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot services like GPTs, simulating human-to-human conversation via machine-generated text, are used in numerous fields. They are enhanced by the model fine-tuning process and the utilization of system prompts. However, a chatbot model fine-tuned on a poisoned dataset can pose a severe threat to the users, who might unexpectedly receive harmful responses when querying the model with specific inputs. Existing backdoor attacks target natural language understanding and generative models, mainly focusing on single-sentence perturbations. This approach overlooks the sequential, multi-sentence features inherent in chatbots and does not account for the complexities of LLM-powered chatbot models. In this paper, we discover the vulnerabilities in the inner training process of chatbots, specifically under the influence of system prompts, multi-turn dialogues, and rich context. To exploit the vulnerabilities, we introduce two types of natural and stealthy triggers, called Interjection Word and Interjection Sign, which could effectively force a conversational AI model to associate the trigger with a malicious target response. We optimize the trigger selection with an evaluation function based on perplexity for balancing attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability to system prompts. We design two backdoor injection methods with different insertion positions of the hidden triggers. Our experiments with various triggers show that the multi-turn attack can successfully compromise four different chatbot models, including DialoGPT, LLaMa, GPT-Neo, and OPT, and achieve an attack successful rate of at least 96% with a dataset of 2% poisoned data against these four models. Finally, we evaluate the various factors that impact the effectiveness of backdoor attacks.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems predict and suggest relevant options to users in various domains, such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based recommendation systems have become increasingly popular in academics and industry since DRL can characterize the long-term interaction between the system and users to achieve a better recommendation experience, e.g., Netflix, Spotify, Google, and YouTube. This paper demonstrates that an adversary can manipulate the DRL-based recommender system by injecting carefully designed user-system interaction records. The poisoning attack against the DRL-based recommender system is formulated as a non-convex integer programming problem. To solve the problem, we proposed a three-phase mechanism (called PARL) to maximize the hit ratio (the proportion of recommendations that result in actual user interactions, such as clicks, purchases, or other relevant actions) while avoiding easy detection. The core idea of PARL is to improve the ranking of the target item while fixing the rankings of other items. Considering the sequential decision-making characteristics of DRL, PARL rearranges the items' order of the fake users to mimic the normal users' sequential features, an aspect usually overlooked in existing work. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PARL and better concealment against the detection techniques. PARL is open-sourced at https://github.com/PARL-RS/PARL.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of blockchain technology in high-value sectors, consensus protocols are becoming critical infrastructures. The rapid innovation cycle in Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols has culminated in HotStuff, which provides linear message complexity in the partially synchronous setting. To achieve this, HotStuff leverages a leader that collects, aggregates, and broadcasts the messages of other validators. This paper analyzes the security implications of such approaches in practice, from the perspective of liveness and availability. By implementing attacks in a globally-distributed testbed, we show that state-of-the-art leader-based protocols are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the leader. Our attacks, demonstrated on committees of up to 64 validators, manage to disrupt liveness within seconds, using only a few tens of Mbps of attack bandwidth per validator. Crucially, the cost and effectiveness of the attacks are independent of the committee size. Based on the outcome of these experiments, we then propose and test effective mitigations. Our findings show that advancements in both protocol design and network-layer defenses can greatly improve the practical resilience of BFT consensus protocols.}

	abstract = {Anonymous credentials empower users with strong privacy controls by enabling them to selectively disclose specific attributes from a credential without unveiling other personal details. However, current anonymous credential systems confront two primary challenges: 1) Their designs are not tailored for resource-limited devices due to their dependence on computationally heavy techniques such as generic zero-knowledge or Groth-Sahai proofs at both presentation and verification phases; and 2) They pose complexities in deploying anonymous credentials as-a-service since users must maintain specific key materials and dedicated software. To tackle these challenges, we present SilentProof, a blockchain-backed anonymous authentication protocol, which offloads the responsibility of credential presentation from individual users to the blockchain. By harnessing the combined strengths of zero-knowledge proxy re-identification and blind signatures, SilentProof empowers the blockchain to create zero-knowledge proofs for users, while ensuring clear user consent and eliminating the need for direct access to user-specific attributes. This design broadens the use cases for anonymous credentials, making it ideal for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric authentication, especially for resource-limited clients. Furthermore, SilentProof lays the groundwork for a new era of privacy-preserving identity management as-a-service. We provide rigorous security proofs to validate our approach and have developed a SilentProof prototype, showcasing the protocol's practical efficiency.}

	abstract = {The anonymity, multi-show unlinkability, and selective disclosure property of anonymous credentials enables users to access third-party services without revealing unnecessary details or being profiled. Threshold-based anonymous credentials provide a distributed framework to issue these credentials. While all of this enhances privacy, anonymity can also be misused and some schemes, therefore, have an opening mechanism, which enables the authorities to trace a user\'s identity. Nevertheless, relying solely on this measure is inadequate as the users can continue to use their previously issued anonymous credentials to authenticate themselves successfully with the service providers. To address this issue, we propose a revocation mechanism for such schemes using dynamic threshold accumulators (DTA) (Helminger et al. 2021). We first formally define a generic threshold-based anonymous credentials with an opening scheme (TACO) and subsequently propose an extension of TACO, "Revocable TACO (RTACO)" - revocable threshold-based credentials over blockchains - that integrates a revocation mechanism based on DTAs to the TACO system. In RTACO, we integrate a revocation handle into the credential as an extra attribute, allowing the disclosure of this attribute during the opening phase, which is then used to blocklist the credential, preventing its further use. We formally prove the security of this scheme in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also give a proof-of-concept implementation of RTACO over the Ethereum blockchain.}

	abstract = {The evolving landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has raised critical security concerns, especially pertaining to Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs) and their dependency on price oracles, which are susceptible to manipulation. The emergence of flash loans has further amplified these risks, enabling increasingly complex oracle manipulation attacks that can lead to significant financial losses. Responding to this threat, we first dissect the attack mechanism by formalizing the standard operational and adversary models for PLFs. Based on our analysis, we propose SecPLF, a robust and practical solution designed to counteract oracle manipulation attacks efficiently. SecPLF operates by tracking a price state for each cryptoasset, including the recent price and the timestamp of its last update. By imposing price constraints on the price oracle usage, SecPLF ensures a PLF only engages a price oracle if the last recorded price falls within a defined threshold, thereby negating the profitability of potential attacks. Our evaluation based on historical market data confirms SecPLF's efficacy in providing high-confidence prevention against arbitrage attacks that arise due to minor price differences. SecPLF delivers proactive protection against oracle manipulation attacks, offering ease of implementation, oracle-agnostic property, and resource and cost efficiency.}

	abstract = {Decentralized blockchain systems have provided a significant leap in autonomous logistics practices by enabling accurate product authentication through the tracking of ownership changes. Although public blockchains could provide open access to stored information, privacy and security concerns lead most existing logistics implementations to rely on private or consortium blockchains. This, however, limits or regulates the end-customer's ability to independently verify product provenance. This paper introduces a novel logistics system, zkLogis, a novel privacy-enhancing logistics system on public blockchain that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to ensure transaction validity, while restricting access to decipher encrypted logistics data to authorized users. Additionally, zkLogis supports scalable group transfers by treating multiple items as a single unit. We employ a zk-SNARK to guarantee the validity of every transaction while permitting only authorized users to verify the provenance of their own products. Furthermore, we define the security notions inherent to zkLogis and construct a scheme that satisfies these notions. Our experimental results show that zkLogis achieves a performance of 4.5 seconds for the anonymous group transfer of user ownership, including the execution time of proof generation and smart contracts, when running on a Linux server.}

	abstract = {Network traffic classification plays a crucial role in both network management and monitoring. Recently, an increasing number of Decentralized Applications (DApps) are appearing on various blockchain platforms. DApps employ encryption techniques such as SSL/TLS to safeguard the data transmitted over the network, making it more challenging to do traffic classification. In this paper, to tackle the challenge of insufficient classification accuracy in the existing classification of encrypted DApp traffic, we present Capsule-Former, a novel encrypted traffic classification model for DApps. CapsuleFormer utilizes capsule neurons instead of traditional scalar neurons, where the neurons within the capsule embody various attributes of particular entities. Furthermore, Transformer blocks are adopted to generate a high-dimensional representation of the capsule activation vector. Thus, CapsuleFormer has the capability to extract potential features from the encrypted traffic patterns of DApps. Moreover, we collect and open a dataset of more than 700,000 encrypted traffic flows from 10 different types of DApps. The results of the experiments on the dataset demonstrate that CapsuleFormer is superior to the current methods, with an accuracy rate of 98.7%.}

	abstract = {Mixing services provide unlinkability for blockchains by breaking the link between sender/receiver identities and are highly appreciated for their compatibility with the underlying blockchains. Many efforts have been made to provide mixing services for either non-confidential or confidential payments. For confidential payments, all the known mixing protocols are designed for confidential blockchains using homomorphic commitment. There is, however, no satisfactory solution for confidential blockchains using public key encryption (PKE), such as PGC and Zether. This work proposes the first universal mixing protocol for confidential blockchains built upon homomorphic PKE. We provide formal security definitions, and prove that the mixing protocol satisfies all the security requirements. Moreover, we present BlindShuffler, an instantiation of the universal mixing protocol. The evaluation shows that when applying BlindShuffler to PGC, notably lower cost is needed to achieve the same level of anonymity compared with other solutions, and it becomes more advantageous with the increase of the anonymous level. As an independent contribution in the building of BlindShuffer, we improve the state-of-the-art standard one-out-of-many proof to support heterogeneous public keys and construct an enhancement with logarithmic membership proof length.}

	abstract = {Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC), a recent addition to the edge computing paradigm, leverages the computing resources of end-user devices to execute computation tasks in close proximity to users. One of the primary challenges in the PEC environment is determining the appropriate servers for offloading computation tasks based on factors, such as computation latency, response quality, device reliability, and cost of service. Computation outsourcing in the PEC ecosystem requires additional security and privacy considerations. Finally, mechanisms need to be in place to guarantee fair payment for the executed service(s). We present PEPPER, a novel, privacy-preserving, and decentralized framework that addresses aforementioned challenges by utilizing blockchain technology and trusted execution environments (TEE). PEPPER improves the performance of PEC by allocating resources among end-users efficiently and securely. It also provides the underpinnings for building a financial ecosystem at the pervasive edge. To evaluate the effectiveness of PEPPER, we developed and deployed a proof of concept implementation on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Intel SGX as the TEE technology. We propose a simple but highly effective remote attestation method that is particularly beneficial to PEC compared to the standard remote attestation method used today. Our extensive comparison experiment shows that PEPPER is 1.23Ã— to 2.15Ã— faster than the current standard remote attestation procedure. In addition, we formally prove the security of our system using the universal composability (UC) framework.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing is an industry-standard software testing technique that uncovers bugs in a target program by executing it with mutated inputs. Over the lifecycle of a fuzzing campaign, the fuzzer accumulates inputs inducing new and interesting target behaviors, drawing from these inputs for further mutation and generation of new inputs. This rapidly results in a large pool of inputs to select from, making it challenging to quickly determine the "most promising" input for mutation. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a natural solution to this seed scheduling problem---a fuzzer can dynamically adapt its selection strategy by learning from past results. However, existing RL approaches are (a) computationally expensive (reducing fuzzer throughput), and/or (b) require hyperparameter tuning (reducing generality across targets and input types). To this end, we propose T-Scheduler, a seed scheduler built upon multi-armed bandit theory to automatically adapt to the target. Notably, our formulation does not require the user to select or tune hyperparameters and is therefore easily generalizable across different targets. We evaluate T-Scheduler over 35 CPU-yr fuzzing effort, comparing it to 11 state-of-the-art schedulers. Our results show that T-Scheduler improves on these 11 schedulers on both bug-finding and coverage-expansion abilities.}

	abstract = {Syzbot continuously fuzzes the full Linux kernel to discover latent bugs. Yet, around 75% of recent kernel bugs are caused by recent patches, dubbed regression bugs. Regression fuzzing prioritizes inputs that target recently or frequently patched code. However, this heuristic breaks down in the kernel environment as there are too many patches (and therefore too many targets). To improve regression fuzzing, we note that certain code change patterns (e.g., modifying GOTO) carry more risk of introducing bugs than others. Leveraging this observation, we introduce SyzRisk, a continuous regression fuzzer for the kernel that stresses bug-prone code changes. SyzRisk introduces code change patterns that allow for identifying risky code changes. After systematically estimating the risk of suspected change patterns under various circumstances, SyzRisk assigns more weight to risky change patterns. Using the accumulated corpus from prior continuous fuzzing, SyzRisk further prioritizes mutation inputs based on the observed weights. We simulated the pattern creation from developers using 146 known Linux kernel root causes including 38 CVE root causes and collected 23 risky change patterns. The evaluation shows that the pattern-based weighting method highlights root-cause commits 3.60x more compared to the heuristic of simply targeting recent and frequent changes. Our evaluation of the Linux kernel v6.0 demonstrates that SyzRisk records a 61% speedup in bug exposure time compared to Syzkaller, while discovering the most complete set of bugs across all compared fuzzers.}

	abstract = {Incorrect handling of Software Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) errors results in bugs or security vulnerabilities that are hard to trigger during regular testing. Most of the existing techniques to detect such errors are based on static analysis and fail to identify certain cases where API return values are incorrectly handled. Furthermore, most of these techniques suffer from a very high false positive rate (â‰¥50%), raising concerns regarding their practical use. We propose a dynamic analysis approach to detect API error handling bugs based on coverage-guided software fault injection. Specifically, we inject faults into APIs and observe how a program handles them. Our fault injection mechanism is generic and targeted to explore a given program's error handling behavior effectively. We avoid false positives by proactively filtering out crashes caused by infeasible faults. We implemented our technique in an automated pipeline called FuzzERR and applied it to 20 different programs spanning 444 APIs. Our evaluation shows that FuzzERR found 31 new and previously unknown bugs resulting from incorrect handling of API errors. Moreover, a comparative evaluation showed that FuzzERR significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art tools.}

	abstract = {In-memory fuzzing, designed to perform direct mutation on memory contents, has gained attention as a technique that enables intensive, efficient testing. To facilitate this fuzzing technique, identifications of mutable buffers, which will be subject to mutation, and fuzzing target functions should be preceded. So far, these identifications have been relied on manual efforts with source code available. Unfortunately, such manual identifications are challenging on binary-only programs due mainly to loss of source-level information during compilation. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes AIMFuzz that supports in-memory fuzzing on binary programs at function level. AIMFuzz largely consists of two stages: the analysis stage that identifies mutable buffers and prioritizes fuzzing target functions based on dynamic taint tracking, and the fuzzing stage that tests the designated target functions by injecting mutated inputs through the identified mutable buffers. Noteworthily, these two stages are carried out automatically, eliminating daunting manual efforts for the binary. Our evaluation results demonstrate that AIMFuzz successfully detects bugs on real applications. AIMFuzz shows great effectiveness in testing selected target functions efficiently and thoroughly, and also comparable performance to the state-of-the-art implementation of in-memory fuzzing with better usability thanks to its automated analysis and testing.}

	abstract = {Coverage-guided fuzz testing has received significant attention from the research community, with a strong focus on binary applications, greatly disregarding other targets, such as web applications. The importance of the World Wide Web in everyone's life cannot be overstated, and to this day, many web applications are developed in PHP. In this work, we address the challenges of applying coverage-guided fuzzing to PHP web applications and introduce Phuzz, a modular fuzzing framework for PHP web applications. Phuzz uses novel approaches to detect more client-side and server-side vulnerability classes than state-of-the-art related work, including SQL injections, remote command injections, insecure deserialization, path traversal, external entity injection, cross-site scripting, and open redirection. We evaluate Phuzz on a diverse set of artificial and real-world web applications with known and unknown vulnerabilities, and compare it against a variety of state-of-the-art fuzzers. In order to show Phuzz' effectiveness, we fuzz over 1,000 API endpoints of the 115 most popular WordPress plugins, resulting in over 20 security issues and 2 new CVE-IDs. Finally, we make the framework publicly available to motivate and encourage further research on web application fuzz testing.}

	abstract = {A common paradigm for improving fuzzing performance is to focus on selected regions of a program rather than its entirety. While previous work has largely explored how these locations can be reached, their selection, that is, the where, has received little attention so far. In this paper, we fill this gap and present the first comprehensive analysis of target selection methods for fuzzing. To this end, we examine papers from leading security and software engineering conferences, identifying prevalent methods for choosing targets. By modeling these methods as general scoring functions, we are able to compare and measure their efficacy on a corpus of more than 1,600 crashes from the OSS-Fuzz project. Our analysis provides new insights for target selection in practice: First, we find that simple software metrics significantly outperform other methods, including common heuristics used in directed fuzzing, such as recently modified code or locations with sanitizer instrumentation. Next to this, we identify language models as a promising choice for target selection. In summary, our work offers a new perspective on directed fuzzing, emphasizing the role of target selection as an orthogonal dimension to improve performance.}

	abstract = {Process synchronization primitives lubricate server computing involving a group of processes as they ensure those processes to properly coordinate their executions for a common purpose such as provisioning a web service. A malfunctioned synchronization due to attacks causes friction among processes and leads to unexpected, and often hard-to-detect, application transaction errors. Unfortunately, synchronization primitives are not naturally protected by existing hardware-assisted isolation techniques e.g., SGX, because their process-oriented isolation conflicts with the primitive's demand for cross-process operations. This paper introduces the Enclave-Semaphore service (ESem) which shelters application semaphores and their operations against kernel-privileged attacks. ESem encapsulates all semaphores in the platform with a dedicated SGX enclave and polices accesses from users processes, thus ensuring a consistent view of the data and resources shared among collaborative processes. Although ESem provides secure semaphores only, it supports all kinds of synchronization needs, owning to the expressiveness of semaphores. We have built a prototype of ESem and conducted rigorous evaluation with micro-benchmarks, macro benchmark and real-world applications including Redis and Apache HTTP Server. ESem incurs only a modest performance overhead (around 2%) to the legacy systems. We also run a case study to demonstrate attacks against the synchronization in an SGX-hardened file server and how ESem neutralizes the attacks successfully with only one function call change to the applications. All these experiments show that ESem is lightweight yet effective solution to the security hole left open by existing isolation schemes.}

	abstract = {Large botnets like Mirai, with 600,000 infected devices, prove that cyber criminals have recognized the potential of attacks against the fast-growing Internet of Things. Moreover, recent critical vulnerabilities like Ripple20 and Amnesia:33 show that taking over a remote system via the network is a real threat. Alarmingly, modern strains of malware rely on exploiting such vulnerabilities to spread, with an increasing tendency. Hence, effective techniques to mitigate the consequences of modern IoT malware are necessary. To that end, we propose TeeFilter, a novel network filtering engine that allows manufacturers and operators of IoT devices to restrict the network traffic of their devices. By selectively executing parts of the network stack in a Trusted Execution Environment, TeeFilter remains untampered even if the operating system is compromised. The operators can specify filtering rules in an LLVM-compatible programming language and compile them into eBPF code. Subsequently, TeeFilter can load and enforce the rules. We formally verify the majority of TeeFilter for correctness and memory safety to eradicate whole classes of vulnerabilities and prototype our system on real hardware to show that the network overhead is negligible. Therefore, we believe that our system is an impactful step to enhance the resiliency of future IoT infrastructure.}

	abstract = {Despite of their benefits, existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) or enclaves have been criticized for lack of transparency, vulnerabilities, and various restrictions. A significant limitation is that they only provide a static and fixed hardware Trusted Computing Base (TCB) that cannot be customized for different applications. The design violates the principle of least privilege by including unnecessary peripherals in the hardware TCB and buggy peripheral drivers in the software TCB. Additionally, Existing TEEs time-share a processor core with the Rich Execution Environment (REE), making execution less efficient and vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. Although many previous projects have focused on addressing software issues in TEEs on SGX, TrustZone, or RISC-V, some TEE issues are inherent in the hardware system's design, making them impossible to resolve with software alone. In this paper, we present BYOTee (Build Your Own Trusted Execution Environments), which is an easy-to-use hardware and software co-design infrastructure for building enclaves using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). BYOTee creates enclaves with customized hardware TCBs and establishes a dynamic root of trust that allows untampered execution of Security-Sensitive Applications (SSA) from preexisting software on the hardcore system. Additionally, BYOTee provides mechanisms to attest the integrity of enclaves' hardware and software stacks. We implement a BYOTee system for the Xilinx System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA. The evaluations on the low-end Zynq-7000 system for four SSAs and 12 benchmark applications demonstrate the usage, security, effectiveness, and performance of the BYOTee framework.}

	abstract = {Trusted execution environment (TEE) is a revolutionary technology that enables secure remote execution (SRE) of cloud workloads on untrusted server-side computing platforms. Both commercial and academic TEEs have been proposed in the past few years, including Intel's SGX and TDX, AMD's SEV, ARM's CCA, IBM's PEF, and their academic counterparts built atop open-source RISC-V processors, such as Keystone, Sanctum, CURE, and Penglai. While great efforts from both sides have been made in developing a confidential computing ecosystem, the existence of server-side TEEs with drastically different designs and the presence of various known attacks have significantly increased the difficulty of understanding TEE designs and the reasons behind existing attacks. This paper offers a structured analysis of the design choices of server-side TEEs, focusing on dissecting TEE designs and identifying their potential pitfalls. We introduce the TEE Runtime Architectural Framework (TRAF), a detailed framework that facilitates a thorough and methodical dissection of TEE designs by analyzing the high-level considerations made by TEE designs. A key aspect of TRAF's analysis is the reconfiguration of resource management in TEE designs, where the host OS used to have full control. By incorporating the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), TEE designs adopt different design choices on how to divide and coordinate tasks between the host OS and TCB to achieve security and effective management of computational resources. TRAF specifically investigates how common resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O devices, are managed jointly by the TCB and host OS. This includes a focused study of factors that influence design choices, such as TCB size, performance, and efficiency. Furthermore, by examining existing vulnerabilities and attacks on TEEs, the paper further evaluates the security impact of varied design choices.}

	abstract = {The adoption of wearable technologies, such as smartwatches or wristbands, is rising. End-users expect to use all of their devices in an interconnected and seamless manner to conduct digital transactions, e.g., to pay or identify via their smartwatches, and not only via their smartphones. As sensitive transactions are usually protected by hardware-enforced isolation mechanisms, such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), this brings new challenges of interconnecting TEEs to collaboratively conduct such transactions. We therefore propose MultiTEE, a distributed TEE architecture for heterogeneous device clusters, enabling secure data exchange and cooperation between TEEs. MultiTEE relies on lightweight, secure channels between TEEs, combined with remote attestation for the integrity verification of software stacks, as well as a memory-safe implementation. This enables an interface between Trusted Applications (TAs) of the distributed TEE similar to the interfaces of classic, single device TEEs. To demonstrate the feasibility of our solution, we built a Proof of Concept (PoC), partially implementing the upcoming European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet to show the usage of heterogeneous device clusters for electronic identification. We evaluate our solution regarding performance and security.}

	abstract = {In Android 12, Google introduced a new security feature called the privacy indicator to protect users from spyware. The privacy indicator visually alerts users by displaying a green circle in the notification bar when an application accesses the camera. While this feature initially appears effective, our work has identified two possible attack scenarios that can undermine it. The first attack uses screen overlay techniques with a higher Z-order and deceptive status bar layouts to make it difficult to see the privacy indicator. In a user study involving 44 participants, only 13.6% of participants recognized the indicator under UI overlay attacks, compared to 63.6% in default Android 12 settings. The second attack exploits device configurations to disable the privacy indicator. Our findings were reported to the developers of the Android system UI at Samsung Electronics and the Google Issue Tracker, and we received acknowledgments from both parties. As countermeasures, we recommend ensuring the integrity of the privacy indicator using trusted execution facilities. We introduce a proof-of-concept solution called SEPI (Security-Enhanced Privacy Indicator), which utilizes a secure hypervisor and ARM TrustZone. SEPI is designed to detect camera and microphone activities, subsequently displaying the relevant indicator with the highest Z-order in a securely isolated display buffer. Our experimental findings revealed only a minimal 3.3% reduction in benchmark scores compared to the device's default operational state. The SEPI privacy indicator is displayed with a negligible mean delay of 20.92 ms.}

To protect against access pattern leakage, Oblivious RAM is a cryptographic primitive that obscures the (actual) access trace at the expense of additional access and periodic shuffling of the server's contents. A class of ORAM solutions, known as Hierarchical ORAM, has achieved theoretically optimal logarithmic bandwidth overhead. However, to date, Hierarchical ORAMs are seen as only theoretical artifacts. This is because they require a large number of communication round-trips to locate (shuffled) elements at the server and involve complex building blocks such as cuckoo hash tables. To address the limitations of Hierarchical ORAM schemes in practice, we introduce Rank ORAM; the first Hierarchical ORAM that can retrieve data with a single round-trip of communication (as compared to a logarithmic number in previous work). To support non-interactive communication, we introduce a compressed client-side data structure that stores, implicitly, the location of each element at the server. In addition, this location metadata enables a simple protocol design that dispenses with the need for complex cuckoo hash tables. Rank ORAM requires asymptotically smaller memory than existing (non-Hierarchical) state-of-the-art practical ORAM schemes (e.g., Ring ORAM) while maintaining comparable bandwidth performance. Our experiments on real network file-system traces demonstrate a reduction in client memory, against existing approaches, of a factor of 100. For example, when outsourcing a database of 17.5TB, required client-memory is only 290MB vs. 40GB for standard approaches.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, it is a popular trend to migrate shortest path and distance (SPD) retrieval on large-scale graphs to cloud environments, harnessing their immense computational capabilities. To protect sensitive information, these graphs are usually encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. A significant challenge is how to answer SPD retrieval in a secure, efficient, and accurate manner. However, recent works have yet to concurrently tackle all three aspects to meet this challenge. To address this challenge, we design, implement, and evaluate Crypt-Graph, the first scheme simultaneously allowing private, efficient, and accurate retrieval over encrypted graphs. CryptGraph leverages additive homomorphic encryptions to protect graphs and client information. A series of secure protocols are tailored based on the two-cloud (i.e., server) model. Supported by these protocols, Crypt-Graph converts SPD retrieval from the ciphertext domain to both the plaintext (for vertices) and secret-sharing (for weights) domains, achieving access pattern protection and remarkable efficiency close to plain retrieval. The security of CryptGraph is formally analyzed under the semi-honest adversary model. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, demonstrating millisecond-level efficiency and 100% accuracy rates.}

	abstract = {Analyzing user data while protecting the privacy of individuals remains a big challenge. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) are a possible solution as they protect processes and Virtual Machines (VMs) against malicious hosts. However, TEEs can leak access patterns to code and to the data being processed. Furthermore, when data is stored in a TEE database, the data volume required to answer a query is another unwanted side channel that contains sensitive information. Both types of information leaks, access patterns and volume patterns, allow for database reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we present Menhir, an oblivious TEE database that hides access patterns with ORAM guarantees and volume patterns through differential privacy. The database allows range and point queries with SQL-like WHERE-clauses. It builds on the state-of-the-art oblivious AVL tree construction Oblix (S&P'18), which by itself does not protect against volume leakage. We show how volume leakage can be exploited in range queries and improve the construction to mitigate this type of attack. We prove the correctness and obliviousness of Menhir. Our evaluation shows that our approach is feasible and scales well with the number of rows and columns in the database.}

	abstract = {Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) has opened up an attractive avenue for privacy-preserved processing of outsourced data on the untrusted cloud infrastructure. SSE aims to support efficient Boolean query processing with optimal storage and search overhead over large real databases. However, current constructions in the literature lack the support for multi-client search and dynamic updates to the encrypted databases, which are essential requirements for the widespread deployment of SSE on real cloud infrastructures. Trivially extending a state-of-the-art single client dynamic construction, such as ODXT (Patranabis et al., NDSS'21), incurs significant leakage that renders such extension insecure in practice. Currently, no SSE construction in the literature offers efficient multi-client query processing and search with dynamic updates over large real databases while maintaining a benign leakage profile. This work presents the first dynamic multi-client SSE scheme Nomos supporting efficient multi-client conjunctive Boolean queries over an encrypted database. Precisely, Nomos is a multi-reader-single-writer construction that allows only the gate-keeper (or the data-owner) - a trusted entity in the Nomos framework, to update the encrypted database stored on the adversarial server. Nomos achieves forward and type-II backward privacy of dynamic SSE constructions while incurring lesser leakage than the trivial extension of ODXT to a multi-client setting. Furthermore, our construction is practically efficient and scalable - attaining linear encrypted storage and sublinear search overhead for conjunctive Boolean queries. We provide an experimental evaluation of software implementation over an extensive real dataset containing millions of records. The results show that Nomos performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art static conjunctive SSE schemes in practice.}

	abstract = {A cryptographic accumulator is a compressed data structure with associated algorithms used for secure membership testing. In the growing space of digital credentials, accumulators are used to manage sets of valid credentials, giving efficient and anonymous methods for credential holders to prove their validity. Unlike traditional credentials like digital signatures, one can easily revoke credentials with an accumulator; however, each revocation forces existing credential holders to engage in an expensive update process. Previous works make this faster and easier by sacrificing anonymity. To improve performance without compromising privacy, we present ALLOSAUR, a multi-party accumulator based on pairings. In ALLOSAUR, we eliminate the cost of accumulating new credentials, let "credential managers" manage the accumulator values with secure multiparty computation, and allow anonymous credential updates with a square-root reduction in communication costs as compared to existing work. A deployed digital credential system is a vast and complicated system, and existing formalisms do not fully address the scope or power of a real-world adversary. We develop a thorough "UC-style" formalism that allows arbitrary malicious behaviour from an adversary controlling a minority of credential managers and arbitrary numbers of users, credentials, and verifiers. In our new formalism we present a novel definition of privacy that captures as much anonymity as possible while accounting for inevitable losses from interaction with the system. The detail in our formalism reveals real-world issues in existing accumulator constructions, all of which ALLOSAUR avoids. The typical bottleneck in accumulator-based digital credential systems is handling revocations of credentials. Our proof-of-concept implementation of ALLOSAUR can update over 1000 revocations with less than half a second of total computation and 16 kB communication, which is at least a 5x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art in both metrics.}

	abstract = {Dynamic searchable encryption (DSE) with forward and backward privacy reduces leakages in early-stage schemes. Security enhancement comes with a price - maintaining updatable keyword-wise state information. State information, if stored locally, incurs significant client-side storage overhead for keyword-rich datasets, potentially hindering real-world deployments. We propose DISCO, a simple and efficient framework for designing DSE schemes using constant client state. DISCO combines range-constrained pseudorandom functions (RCPRFs) over a global counter and leverages nice properties from the underlying primitives and index structure to simultaneously achieve forward-and-backward privacy and constant client state. To configure DISCO concretely, we identify a set of RCPRF properties that are vital for the resulting DISCO instantiations. By configuring DISCO with different RCPRFs, we resolve efficiency and usability issues in existing schemes. We further optimize DISCO's concrete efficiency without downgrading security. We implement DISCO constructions and report performance, showing trade-offs from different DISCO constructions. Besides, we compare the practical efficiency of DISCO with existing non-constant-state DSE schemes, demonstrating DISCO's competitive efficiency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel behavioral biometric recognition framework, BlinkAuth, that takes advantage of a user's blinking. BlinkAuth utilizes electrooculogram (EOG) data, (i.e., the electric potential difference between the corneal and retinal sides of the eye), and applies a machine-learning model to achieve user recognition. BlinkAuth works with devices like smart glasses and VR headsets and can be used simultaneously in activities such as driving or cooking. Using JINS MEME, a glasses-type wearable device that can measure EOG, we collected EOG data from 31 participants under various conditions and evaluated the recognition accuracy of BlinkAuth. The results demonstrate that BlinkAuth can achieve high accuracy as a behavioral biometric recognition with an average AUC of 95.8% and an average EER of 9.28%. We developed a system for implementing BlinkAuth for real-time recognition and evaluated the time required for the recognition process and the system's usability with the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results show an overall processing time of approximately 0.6 seconds, including the data measurement time, and an average SUS score of 82.50, which indicates high usability equivalent to rank A in the standard criteria for interpreting SUS scores. Six extensive user experiments and 17 evaluation perspectives reveal that BlinkAuth is highly robust to environmental changes, such as skin moisture and makeup, participant actions, and eye strain conditions, as well as to attacks that imitate the target's blinking.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of web tracking via advertisements has led to an increased adoption of privacy-preserving browser extensions. These extensions are crucial for blocking trackers and enhancing the overall web browsing experience. The advertising industry is constantly changing, leading to ongoing development and improvements in both new and existing ad-blocking and anti-tracking extensions. Despite this, there is a lack of comprehensive studies exploring the set of user concerns associated with these extensions. Our research addresses this gap by identifying five user concerns and establishing a privacy and usability topics framework, specific to privacy-preserving extensions. Also, many of these user concerns have not been extensively studied in the prior works. Therefore, we conducted an extensive literature review to identify shortcomings in the current benchmarking methodology. This led to the development of new techniques, including experiments to measure newly identified metrics. Our study reveals eight new metrics for privacy-preserving extensions that have not been previously measured. Additionally, our study enhances the measurement methodology for two metrics, ensuring precise results. We focus particularly on metrics that users commonly encounter on the web and report in Chrome web store reviews. Our goal is to serve as a foundational reference for future research in this field.}

	abstract = {Organizations are increasingly reliant on third-party software products to expedite their own development cycles, often incorporating numerous components into their end systems, resulting in a lack of transparency in software dependencies. Malicious actors exploit this, leading to Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks with substantial economic and security damages. To mitigate this threat, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) concept was introduced. It details software components and their supply chain relationships, thus enhancing SSC transparency. Unfortunately, SBOM adoption still remains limited. While previous studies identified some reasons behind this, they overlooked the perspectives of different business stakeholder groups involved in SBOM's lifecycle. In this work, we address this gap by studying business stakeholder groups directly involved in SBOM production and consumption. The main goal of this work is to identify which groups can drive or inhibit SBOM adoption and the rationale behind this behavior. By conducting interviews with the group representatives, we identified stakeholder-specific risks, benefits, concerns and incentives regarding SBOM adoption. Our analysis suggests that SBOM adoption potential is higher among System Integrators and Software Vendors. At the same time, B2B customers and Individual Developers have the least motivation, inhibiting the process of SBOM adoption. Given that these are the main SBOM consuming and supplying stakeholders correspondingly, we conclude that the overall adoption potential of this technology is currently limited and requires considerable external impulse.}

	abstract = {The rapid spread of false information and persistent manipulation attacks on online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements. Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics concerning false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape. By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM), including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research, we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations, and our systematization can guide future research efforts and assist OSN providers in ensuring the safety and integrity of their platforms.}

In this paper, we construct single-use delegatable ECDSA signatures based on commodity smartphones with hardware-backed keystores. We show how to apply our construction to the web authentication use case. In particular, we show how to delegate FIDO credentials to third parties while not introducing new assumptions to the setting besides the delegate's trust in the security of the keystore. As an independent application, we discuss the use of our construction as a way to implement blind checks in ECDSA-based cryptocurrencies.}

	abstract = {WebAuthn is a passwordless authentication protocol which allows users to authenticate to online services using public-key cryptography. Users prove their identity by signing a challenge with a private key, which is stored on a device such as a cell phone or a USB security token. This approach avoids many of the common security problems with password-based authentication. WebAuthn's reliance on proof-of-possession leads to a usability issue, however: a user who loses access to their authenticator device either loses access to their accounts or is required to fall back on a weaker authentication mechanism. To solve this problem, Yubico has proposed a protocol which allows a user to link two tokens in such a way that one (the primary authenticator) can generate public keys on behalf of the other (the backup authenticator). With this solution, users authenticate with a single token, only relying on their backup token if necessary for account recovery. However, Yubico's protocol relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem for its security and hence is vulnerable to an attacker with a powerful enough quantum computer. We present a WebAuthn recovery protocol which can be instantiated with quantum-safe primitives. We also critique the security model used in previous analysis of Yubico's protocol and propose a new framework which we use to evaluate the security of both the group-based and the quantum-safe protocol. This leads us to uncover a weakness in Yubico's proposal which escaped detection in prior work but was revealed by our model. In our security analysis, we require the cryptographic primitives underlying the protocols to satisfy a number of novel security properties such as KEM unlinkability, which we formalize. We prove that well-known quantum-safe algorithms, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, satisfy the properties required for analysis of our quantum-safe protocol.}

	abstract = {Efficient (non-interactive) aggregate signature schemes in the post-quantum setting are still missing. We define the concept of Byzantine fault-tolerant aggregate signature schemes. This notion fills a middle-ground between interactive and non-interactive signature aggregation. Signers are required to interact but some may fail or misbehave at any point in the signing protocol. Then, we provide efficient constructions of such schemes based on lattice assumptions. We show their security in the programmable random oracle model. For N participants they tolerate up to N - 1 Byzantine failures assuming a correct aggregator, and [EQUATION] failures in general. Our final construction is more efficient than Squirrel, the state-of-the-art non-interactive scheme, which in contrast to ours is also just a few-time signature scheme. Asymptotically signature sizes are polylogarithmic in the total number of participants. In the failure-free case our scheme becomes essentially equivalent to --- and thus just as efficient as --- a state-of-the-art interactive aggregate signature schemes from lattice assumptions. At the same time we make weaker assumptions on the signing protocol. Finally, we parameterize, implement, and evaluate our signature scheme. We find that it has aggregate signatures of sizes (i) between 41 KiB (best case) and 151 KiB (worst case) for 1000 signers, (ii) between 59 KiB (best case) and 399 KiB (worst case) for 10,000 signers, and (iii) between 75 KiB (best case) and 750 KiB (worst case) for 100,000 signers. Verification times for our Rust implementation are in practice faster than those of a state-of-the-art implementation of aggregate BLS signatures, at the cost of slower signature aggregation, both by about one order of magnitude.}

	abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.}

PCNs allow for path-based transactions between users without the need to access the blockchain. These path-based transactions are possible only if a suitable path exists from the sender of a payment to the receiver. In this paper, we propose Auroch, a distributed auction-based pathfinding and routing protocol that takes into account the routing fees charged by nodes along a path. Unlike other routing protocols proposed for PCNs, Auroch takes routing fees into consideration. Auroch maximizes the profit that can be achieved by an intermediate node at the same time minimizing the overall payment cost for the sender.}

	abstract = {Payment channel networks are a promising solution to the scalability challenge of blockchains and are designed for significantly increased transaction throughput compared to the layer one blockchain. Since payment channel networks are essentially decentralized peer-to-peer networks, routing transactions is a fundamental challenge. Payment channel networks have some unique security and privacy requirements that make pathfinding challenging, for instance, network topology is not publicly known, and sender/receiver privacy should be preserved, in addition to providing atomicity guarantees for payments. In this paper, we present an efficient privacy-preserving routing protocol, SPRITE, for payment channel networks that supports concurrent transactions. By finding paths offline and processing transactions online, SPRITE can process transactions in just two rounds, which is more efficient compared to prior work. We evaluate SPRITE's performance using Lightning Network data and prove its security using the Universal Compos-ability framework. In contrast to the current cutting-edge methods that achieve rapid transactions, our approach significantly reduces the message complexity of the system by 3 orders of magnitude while maintaining similar latencies.}

	abstract = {The Bitcoin scalability problem has led to the development of off-chain financial mechanisms such as payment channel networks (PCNs) which help users process transactions of varying amounts, including micro-payment transactions, without writing each transaction to the blockchain. Since PCNs only allow path-based transactions, effective, secure routing protocols that find a path between a sender and receiver are fundamental to PCN operations. In this paper, we propose RACED, a routing protocol that leverages the idea of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to route transactions in PCNs in a fast and secure way. Our experiments on real-world transaction datasets show that RACED gives an average transaction success ratio of 98.74%, an average pathfinding time of 31.242 seconds, which is 1.65 Ã— 103, 1.8 Ã— 103, and 4 Ã— 102 times faster than three other recent routing protocols that offer comparable security/privacy properties. We rigorously analyze and prove the security of RACED in the Universal Composability framework.}

We propose Applause, a ticketing system allowing the purchase, refund, validation, and transfer of tickets based on trusted authority, while guaranteeing the anonymity of users, as long as the used payment method provides anonymity. To study its security, we formalise the security of the transferable E-Ticket scheme in the game-based paradigm. We prove the security of Applause computationally in the standard model and symbolically using the protocol verifier ProVerif. Applause relies on standard cryptographic primitives, rendering our construction efficient and scalable, as shown by a proof-of-concept.

In this work, we aim to advance the state-of-the-art dynamic analysis approach by enabling it to increase the coverage of the target application's functionalities. Our approach takes as input the application's online documentation and leverages ChatGPT to generate a large number of test codes for functionalities in the documentation. This automated process eliminates the barrier to manually writing a large number of test codes for conducting dynamic analysis. Through our preliminary evaluation, we confirmed that ChatGPT can be used effectively to automatically generate a large number of test codes. Also, we observed early evidence that the seccomp policy generated from running the test codes could be more sound than the ones generated by static analysis.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to train a global machine learning model without sharing their private training data. Peer-to-peer (P2P) FL advances existing centralized FL paradigms by eliminating the server that aggregates local models from participants and then updates the global model. However, P2P FL is vulnerable to (i) honest-but-curious participants whose objective is to infer private training data of other participants, and (ii) Byzantine participants who can transmit arbitrarily manipulated local models to corrupt the learning process. P2P FL schemes that simultaneously guarantee Byzantine resilience and preserve privacy have been less studied. In this paper, we develop Brave, a protocol that ensures Byzantine Resilience And priVacy-prEserving property for P2P FL in the presence of both types of adversaries. We show that Brave preserves privacy by establishing that any honest-but-curious adversary cannot infer other participants' private data by observing their models. We further prove that Brave is Byzantine-resilient, which guarantees that all benign participants converge to an identical model that deviates from a global model trained without Byzantine adversaries by a bounded distance. We evaluate Brave against three state-of-the-art adversaries on a P2P FL for image classification tasks on benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and MNIST. Our results show that global models learned with Brave in the presence of adversaries achieve comparable classification accuracy to global models trained in the absence of any adversary.}

	abstract = {Transfer learning (TL) has been demonstrated to improve DNN model performance when faced with a scarcity of training samples. However, the suitability of TL as a solution to reduce vulnerability of overfitted DNNs to privacy attacks is unexplored. A class of privacy attacks called membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a given sample belongs to the training dataset (member) or not (nonmember). We introduce Double-Dip to investigate the use of TL (Stage-1) combined with randomization (Stage-2) to thwart MIAs on overfitted DNNs without degrading classification accuracy. Our study examines roles of shared feature space and parameter values between source and target models, number of frozen layers, and complexity of pretrained models. Our preliminary evaluations of Double-Dip demonstrate that Stage-1 reduces adversary success while also significantly increasing classification accuracy of nonmembers against an adversary attempting to carry out SOTA label-only MIAs. After Stage-2, success of an adversary carrying out a label-only MIA is further reduced to near 50%, bringing it closer to a random guess and showing the effectiveness of Double-Dip. Stage-2 of Double-Dip also achieves lower ASR and higher classification accuracy than regularization and differential privacy-based methods.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are vulnerable to Trojan attacks, wherein a Trojaned DNN will mispredict trigger-embedded inputs as malicious targets, while outputs for clean inputs remain unaffected. Output-based Trojaned model detectors, which analyze outputs of DNNs to perturbed inputs have emerged as a promising approach for identifying Trojaned DNN models. At present, these SOTA detectors assume that the adversary is (i) static and (ii) does not have prior knowledge about deployed detection mechanisms. In this work in progress, we present an adaptive adversary that can retrain a Trojaned DNN and is also aware of output-based Trojaned model detectors. Such an adversary can ensure (1) high accuracy on both trigger-embedded and clean samples and (2) bypass detection. Our approach uses an observation that the high dimensionality of DNN parameters provides sufficient degrees of freedom to achieve these objectives. We also enable SOTA detectors to be adaptive by allowing retraining to recalibrate their parameters, thus modeling a co-evolution of parameters of a Trojaned model and detectors. We then show that this co-evolution can be modeled as an iterative game, and prove that the solution of this interactive game leads to the adversary successfully achieving the above objectives. We also show that for cross-entropy or log-likelihood loss functions used by the DNNs, a greedy algorithm provides provable guarantees on the needed number of trigger-embedded samples.}

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are closed-loop feedback systems that efficiently control the physical processes through cyber-systems. Security threats like false data injection (FDI) attacks are increasing in CPSs. FDI attacks disrupt the system's performance by modifying the original data. It is necessary to have mechanisms in place to defend against FDI attacks and enhance security in CPSs. This paper proposes a two-stage defense scheme against an FDI attack that can simultaneously modify the data in physical and cyber systems. The first stage is attack detection using a watermarking technique with a Chi-square detector. The second stage is attack mitigation, in which we generate a time-varying compensation signal to reduce the attacker's effect and propose a control scheme. We demonstrate the simulation results of the proposed defense scheme against the FDI attack using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) as an example.}

	abstract = {Quantum computers are set to revolutionize multiple application domains, including financial portfolio optimization, drug discovery, supply chain optimization, and cryptography, by offering algorithmic speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. This large-scale adoption will also make quantum computers a lucrative target for cyber-criminals. However, to date, there has been minimal experimental study on the possible attack surfaces and the severity of attacks on a real quantum computer. In this work, we introduce MalaQ, a malware specifically developed for quantum computers. MalaQ exploits the classical-computer frontend of a quantum system and causes extensive damages like performance degradation and even complete failure of the quantum circuits. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation, and experiments using MalaQ in great detail, including drawing parallels with prior works on both classical and quantum cyber-attacks.}

	abstract = {Compared with the traditional usage of large language models (LLMs) where users directly send queries to an LLM, LLM-integrated applications serve as middleware to refine users' queries with domain-specific knowledge to better inform LLMs and enhance the responses. However, LLM-integrated applications also introduce new attack surfaces. This work considers a setup where the user and LLM interact via an application in the middle. We focus on the interactions that begin with user's queries and end with LLM-integrated application returning responses to the queries, powered by LLMs at the service backend. We identify potential high-risk vulnerabilities in this setting that can originate from the malicious application developer or from an outsider threat initiator that can control the database access, manipulate and poison high-risk data for the user. Successful exploits of the identified vulnerabilities result in the users receiving responses tailored to the intent of a threat initiator. We assess such threats against LLM-integrated applications empowered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Our experiments show that the threats can effectively bypass the restrictions and moderation policies of OpenAI, resulting in users exposing to the risk of bias, toxic content, privacy, and disinformation. We develop a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense to mitigate insider and outsider threats. Our evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our defense.}

	abstract = {Intel SGX is a power technology designed to establish a trusted execution environment on processors. Despite its promising features, there are various potential attack surfaces like the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) that could be exploited to extract security-sensitive data from SGX enclaves. To address this security threat, Intel has introduced anti side-channel interface (ASCI) that disables the PMU when an SGX enclave is running. However, little attention has been paid to performing the security evaluation of the ASCI feature, leaving the possibility of reviving such an attack. In this paper, we study if Intel's ASCI feature truly hides the internal execution state of SGX enclaves from the PMU to completely eliminate PMU-driven attack surfaces. To achieve this, we design a novel framework that investigates the effect of the running enclave on all possible performance monitoring events. The key idea of our framework is to (i) analyze the linearity between the number of instructions executed within an enclave and the corresponding measured events and (ii) perform single-stepping and zero-stepping attacks with performance monitoring events. Our security evaluation demonstrates that SGX enclave does not leave any footprint on PMUs, except for opt-in (i.e., debug) enclave where a hardware-based protection mechanism is not supported.}

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts offer innovative ways to automate transactions and execute agreements within blockchain systems. However, its inherent complexity can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. With the advent of large language models, many studies put a special focus on identifying vulnerabilities using these models. Nonetheless, language models are ineffective with the lengthy input sequences. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel multi-label vulnerability detection mechanism using pre-trained language model CodeT5+ combined with a unique multi-block fusion. The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve up to 0.998 F1-score and require only 0.39 ms of processing time on a collected dataset comprising 421,266 contracts from Ethereum.}

	abstract = {IoT device provisioning is the process of setting up headless IoT devices with their companion mobile apps. IoT vendors and manufacturers have the flexibility of different provisioning methods, one of them being the Access Point (AP) pairing mode over Wi-Fi, and hence, they can derive existing Wi-Fi threats and add new ones. AP pairing mode provisioning shares critical information about the Wi-Fi router or sends an authentication token associated with the user\'s cloud account, which may lead to vulnerabilities. In this paper, we have designed and developed a vulnerability testing tool called "iTieProbe". iTieProbe captures the Wi-Fi traffic to check the provisioning of commercial IoT devices and has the capability to extract critical security parameters. Further, iTieprobe selectively crafts the captured Wi-Fi packets and replays them to test three different vulnerabilities (V1- V3): i) In V1- iTieprobe replays the Wi-Fi packets outside the lifetime of the authentication token without any manipulation, ii) In V2 - iTieprobe replays within the lifetime of the authentication token without any manipulation in the Wi-Fi packets, iii) In V3- iTieprobe meticulously crafts the selected UDP packets and then replays it within the lifetime of the authentication token. The effect of these vulnerabilities ranges from a simple denial of service by a legitimate user not being able to provision the IoT device to a more severe one, where an adversary can set up the IoT devices. We have evaluated the efficacy of iTieprobe against two commercial IoT devices, IoT Haat Smart Plug and Wipro Smart Plug, that are using Tuya-based implementations for their provisioning. We believe this work will help the vendors to improve their provisioning methods.}
