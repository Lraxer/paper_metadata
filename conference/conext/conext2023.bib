	abstract = {Aggressive network scanners, i.e., ones with immoderate and persistent behaviors, ubiquitously search the Internet to identify insecure and publicly accessible hosts. These scanners generally lie within two main categories; i) benign research-oriented probers; ii) nefarious actors that forage for vulnerable victims and host exploitation. However, the origins, characteristics and the impact on real networks of these aggressive scanners are not well understood. In this paper, via the vantage point of a large network telescope, we provide an extensive longitudinal empirical analysis of aggressive IPv4 scanners that spans a period of almost two years. Moreover, we examine their network impact using flow and packet data from two academic ISPs. To our surprise, we discover that a non-negligible fraction of packets processed by ISP routers can be attributed to aggressive scanners. Our work aims to raise the network community's awareness for these ''heavy hitters'', especially the miscreant ones, whose invasive and rigorous behavior i) makes them more likely to succeed in abusing the hosts they target and ii) imposes a network footprint that can be disruptive to critical network services by incurring consequences akin to denial of service attacks.}

	abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) is gaining traction as a compelling application due to recent advancements in hardware and software. Previous studies have suggested that distributing AR services on an edge computing infrastructure can offer significant performance benefits, especially for consolidating concurrent clients. In this study, we shed light on several research challenges directly impacting the effective integration of distributed AR and edge computing. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments by deploying our distributed stream processing-based AR pipeline, scAtteR, on a representative edge-cloud infrastructure managed by the Oakestra framework. We uncover several unapparent challenges that inhibit the effective marriage of distributed AR when deployed on edge and demonstrate the potential improvements through scAtteR++. We offer valuable insights and best practices to the growing AR research community, specifically those interested in leveraging edge and public cloud technologies for large-scale AR operations.}

	abstract = {Quantum Computers (QCs) differ radically from traditional computers and can efficiently solve mathematical problems fundamental to our current cryptographic algorithms. Although existing QCs need to accommodate more qubits to break cryptographic algorithms, the concern of ''Store-Now-Decrypt-Later'' (i.e., adversaries store encrypted data today and decrypt them once powerful QCs become available) highlights the necessity to adopt quantum-safe approaches as soon as possible. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) on TLS 1.3. Different signature algorithms and key agreements (as proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) are examined through black- and white-box measurements to get precise handshake latencies and computational costs per participating library. We emulated loss, bandwidth, and delay to analyze constrained environments. Our results reveal that HQC and Kyber are on par with our current state-of-the-art, while Dilithium and Falcon are even faster. We observed no performance drawback from using hybrid algorithms; moreover, on higher NIST security levels, PQC outperformed any algorithm in use today. Hence, we conclude that post-quantum TLS is suitable for adoption in today's systems.}

	abstract = {Troubleshooting WiFi networks is knowingly difficult due to the variability of the wireless medium. Complementary to existing works that focus on detecting short-term fluctuations of radio signals (i.e., anomalies), we tackle the problem of reliably detecting long-term changes in statistical properties of WiFi networks. We propose a new method to reliably gain insights on such environmental changes, which we refer to as Random Access Point Forest (RAPF). RAPF identifies the changes from a forest of individual learners, each of them consisting of a random tree approximating the signal of a specific pair of APs. The biased selection of APs in a distributed manner along with the stochastic construction of each individual tree ensure its robustness to noise and biases. We conduct a measurement campaign on a real WLAN by collecting the path loss among pairs of APs in a network for which labels are available and perform an extensive comparison of our methodology against state-of-the-art change point methodologies, which conclusively shows RAPF to yield the most robust detection capabilities.}

	abstract = {Starlink constellations are currently the largest LEO WAN and have seen considerable interest from the research community. In this paper, we use high-frequency and high-fidelity measurements to uncover evidence of hierarchical traffic controllers in Starlink -- a global controller which allocates satellites to terminals and an on-satellite controller that schedules transmission of user flows. We then devise a novel approach for identifying how satellites are allocated to user terminals. Using data gathered with this approach, we measure the characteristics of the global controller and identify the factors that influence the allocation of satellites to terminals. Finally, we use this data to build a model which approximates Starlink's global scheduler. Our model is able to predict the characteristics of the satellite allocated to a terminal at a specific location and time with reasonably high accuracy and at a rate significantly higher than baseline.}

	abstract = {GPU-aided servers are widely used to accelerate the increasing computing workload on edge network. However, massive computing requests can cause delays in transmission and processing at edge servers, leading to long response time and high system energy consumption. Moreover, in distributed scenarios, GPUs from different vendors can hardly communicate directly through the network. As a rare open-source GPU architecture, Vortex has been emerged to enable an FPGA accelerator to serve as a PCIe-based soft GPU. On this basis, Vortex GPUs in our edge acceleration architecture further integrate the low-latency RDMA function. Compared with the original Vortex GPU-aided servers cluster, our preliminary study shows that our Vortex GPU cluster is fast, scalable, and energy-efficient.}

	abstract = {Random Forests (RF) have been a popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for more than two decades. This success can be attributed to its simplicity, effectiveness and explainability. However, implementing them in a high-speed programmable data plane is not trivial. To make predictions, i.e., inference, RFs must traverse each tree from the root to the leaf by comparing the features vector at each split node. This process is particularly challenging in network devices where memory is limited, and packet processing cannot be delayed, i.e., predictions occur at line rate. Nevertheless, this implementation is crucial for incorporating recent ML advances in the network, which could benefit use cases such as scheduling, measurements, and routing [1]. Prior studies such as Planter [4] have examined the implementation of RF in network switches, mapping trees to Match-Action Tables (MAT). Another line of work focused on RF implementations optimized for FPGA, mapping tree layers to pipeline stages as done in [2]. Such approaches use different tree representations that naturally come with their strengths and weaknesses depending on the trees' sparsity, depth, and input features. In this work we (1) propose a novel representation for FPGA-based Random Forests, (2) compare it against state-of-the-art implementations in terms of memory and computation requirements, and (3) evaluate our design on a flow classification task using CAIDA traffic traces.}

However, as the number of jobs increases, the communication overhead increases since the INA switch's resources for aggregation are limited. To reduce the communication overhead, gradient quantization approaches that compress gradients into fewer bits can be used. Although these approaches are effective in INA, existing INA schemes cannot efficiently use the switch's resources for low-bit quantized gradients. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware in-network aggregation (QAINA) scheme that provides flexible aggregation and achieves efficient resource utilization for low-bit quantized gradients.}

	abstract = {Existing BLE backscatter systems are prone to false triggering by non-target carriers, which causes invalid backscatter transmission. We present IDBlue, which can accurately identify the periodic target excitations generated from a reliable edge, thus achieving an efficient uplink. Specifically, IDBlue utilizes an Iterate-Sync method that can identify the periodic carriers among ambient signals and achieves an accuracy of 99%.}

	abstract = {Traditional LTE backscatter devices continuously reflect signals as long as they have sufficient energy, which results in wasted energy and transmission failure since LTE receivers operate in a low duty cycle manner. We present EPScatter, which utilizes standards-compliant paging to allow tags and receivers to maintain consistent sleep and wake schedules. In particular, EPScatter uses a low-power state machine to adapt to the different transmission stages of the receiver. For example, when the receiver goes to sleep, the tag also goes to sleep for energy saving and efficient transmission.}

	abstract = {Retry mechanisms are commonly used in microservices architectures as a mechanism for recovering from transit errors, including network failures and service overloading. This research aims at studying the operation of cloud retry mechanisms under deliberated DDoS attacks, and their effect on the application performance and operational costs. In this poster we focus on the economic aspect, and demonstrate that enabling such mechanisms improperly might be counter-productive and expose the system to substantial and quadratic economical damage in the presence of attacks.}

	abstract = {Carpet-Bombing Pulse-wave attacks are new types of DDoS attacks aiming at overloading network links in order to slow down the traffic going through those links. The objective is to downgrade the network performance, or the performance of part of its traffic. The question addressed by this research is how such an attack should be performed in order to maximize performance damage. Should worst-case attacks spread across many network links? Alternatively, should it be concentrated? And which links are most likely to get attacked? We consider a general communication network model and derive performance maximizing attack strategies. We show that in order to maximize their damage, these attacks should concentrate at specific links. This approach will be further used to study optimal design and planning of networks to minimize such possible damages.}

	abstract = {Federated learning as a distributed category yields sub-optimal performance for the presence of Non-iid in multi-domain data. To this end, we proposes a novel clustered federated framework for unsupervised multi-domain network anomaly detection, which implements dynamic clustered federated based on the data distribution of different domain so that each edge user learns the domain-optimized inference model. Compared to baseline, the proposed method enables users to obtain domain-optimal performance.}
