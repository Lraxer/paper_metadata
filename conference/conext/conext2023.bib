	abstract = {In this paper, we study an important, yet unexplored problem of configuration dependencies in 5G/4.5G radio resource control (RRC). Different from the previous studies in 3G/4G networks, 5G/4.5G allows more than one cells to serve a mobile device, resulting in more configuration dynamics and complexity that vary with all the serving cells. We analyze inter-dependency among configurations, categorize dependent misconfigurations, uncover their root causes, and quantify negative performance impacts. Specifically, we formulate configuration updates into a delta state machine (DSM) and unveil two types of dependent misconfigurations among states (inter-state) and within a state (intra-state); They stem from structural dependency and cross-parameter dependency. We further show that such misconfigurations incur service disruption and performance degradation. Our findings have been largely validated with three US operators and one Chinese operator; Our study has uncovered 644 instances of problematic dependencies.}

	abstract = {Inferring the root cause of failures among thousands of components in a data center network is challenging, especially for "gray" failures that are not reported directly by switches. Faults can be localized through end-to-end measurements, but past localization schemes are either too slow for large-scale networks or sacrifice accuracy. We describe Flock, a network fault localization algorithm and system that achieves both high accuracy and speed at datacenter scale. Flock uses a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) to achieve high accuracy, coupled with new techniques to dramatically accelerate inference in discrete-valued Bayesian PGMs. Large-scale simulations and experiments in a hardware testbed show Flock speeds up inference by >10000x compared to past PGM methods, and improves accuracy over the best previous datacenter fault localization approaches, reducing inference error by 1.19-11x on the same input telemetry, and by 1.2-55x after incorporating passive telemetry. We also prove Flock\'s inference is optimal in restricted settings.}

	abstract = {The end-to-end principle is one of the foundations of the original Internet architecture. This principle is put to the test by middleboxes, i.e., devices which change important parts of a packet in transit. Middleboxes can have beneficial effects, such as a lower handshake time, but also make it more difficult to deploy newly developed protocols, such as TLS 1.3 and QUIC. Therefore, it is important to have a good understanding of the middlebox ecosystem in the Internet. In this paper, we present results from a multi-faceted middlebox analysis study. We develop Yarrpbox, a tool to efficiently perform middlebox detection measurements on an Internet-scale. With Yarrpbox, we perform IPv4-wide middlebox detection and find that nearly 10% of paths are affected by a total of 5.8k middlebox devices. We perform the first IPv6 study to date, uncovering a lower prevalence of middleboxes in IPv6. Moreover, we show that the location of a vantage point can have an effect on the results, leading to up to 600 more detected middleboxes. Additionally, we characterize middleboxes by mapping them to vendors and resolving aliases. Finally, we release Yarrpbox as open-source software and make data and analysis code publicly available.}

We implement different design choices of DoC in RIOT, an open-source operating system for the IoT, evaluate performance measures in a testbed, compare with DNS over UDP and DNS over DTLS, and validate our protocol design based on empirical DNS IoT data. Our findings indicate that plain DoC is on par with common DNS solutions for the constrained IoT but significantly outperforms when additional standard features of CoAP are used such as caching. With OSCORE, we can save more than 10 kBytes of code memory compared to DTLS, when a CoAP application is already present, and retain the end-to-end trust chain with intermediate proxies, while leveraging features such as group communication or encrypted en-route caching. We also discuss a compression scheme for very restricted links that reduces data by up to 70%.}

	abstract = {Operational networks commonly rely on machine learning models for many tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application performance, and forecasting demand. Yet, model accuracy can degrade due to concept drift, whereby the relationship between the features and the target to be predicted changes. Mitigating concept drift is an essential part of operationalizing machine learning models in general, but is of particular importance in networking's highly dynamic deployment environments. In this paper, we first characterize concept drift in a large cellular network for a major metropolitan area in the United States. We find that concept drift occurs across many important key performance indicators (KPIs), independently of the model, training set size, and time interval---thus necessitating practical approaches to detect, explain, and mitigate it. We then show that frequent model retraining with newly available data is not sufficient to mitigate concept drift, and can even degrade model accuracy further. Finally, we develop a new methodology for concept drift mitigation, Local Error Approximation of Features (LEAF). LEAF works by detecting drift; explaining the features and time intervals that contribute the most to drift; and mitigates it using forgetting and over-sampling. We evaluate LEAF against industry-standard mitigation approaches (notably, periodic retraining) with more than four years of cellular KPI data. Our initial tests with a major cellular provider in the US show that LEAF consistently outperforms periodic and triggered retraining on complex, real-world data while reducing costly retraining operations.}

After review, each paper was conditionally accepted (with shepherding), allowed a "oneshot- major" revision, or rejected. The review process was split into two rounds. All submissions received at least 3 reviews in the first round. The papers that advanced to the second round received at least two additional reviews. After an online discussion phase among the reviewers, papers were extensively discussed during an online Associate Editors\' meeting where the final decisions were made. In case of major revision, the authors have been invited to address the reviewers\' comments and prepare a thoroughly revised version of their contribution. Revised papers have been then thoroughly reviewed again before being either accepted or rejected. This issue collects papers that have been finally accepted for publication after going through the minor revision process. The long papers published in this issue and in the two previous ones will be presented at the CoNEXT 2023 conference on December 5-8, in Paris, France together with the short papers that appear in the conference proceedings.}

	abstract = {Embedding covert streams into a cover channel is a common approach to circumventing Internet censorship, due to censors' inability to examine encrypted information in otherwise permitted protocols (Skype, HTTPS, etc.). However, recent advances in machine learning (ML) enable detecting a range of anti-censorship systems by learning distinct statistical patterns hidden in traffic flows. Therefore, designing obfuscation solutions able to generate traffic that is statistically similar to innocuous network activity, in order to deceive ML-based classifiers at line speed, is difficult. In this paper, we formulate a practical adversarial attack strategy against flow classifiers as a method for circumventing censorship. Specifically, we cast the problem of finding adversarial flows that will be misclassified as a sequence generation task, which we solve with Amoeba, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that we design. Amoeba works by interacting with censoring classifiers without any knowledge of their model structure, but by crafting packets and observing the classifiers' decisions, in order to guide the sequence generation process. Our experiments using data collected from two popular anti-censorship systems demonstrate that Amoeba can effectively shape adversarial flows that have on average 94% attack success rate against a range of ML algorithms. In addition, we show that these adversarial flows are robust in different network environments and possess transferability across various ML models, meaning that once trained against one, our agent can subvert other censoring classifiers without retraining.}

Having a large-scale continuously updating capability would be essential for understanding the spatiotemporal behaviors of C2 servers and, ultimately, for helping contain botnet activities. Unfortunately, existing information from threat intelligence feeds and previous works is often limited to a specific set of botnet families or short-term data collections. Responding to this need, we present C2Store, an initiative to provide the most comprehensive information on C2 servers. Our work makes the following contributions: (a) we develop techniques to collect, verify, and combine C2 server addresses from five types of sources, including uncommon platforms, such as GitHub and Twitter; (b) we create an open-access annotated database of 335,967 C2 servers across 133 malware families, which supports semantically-rich and smart queries; (c) we identify surprising behaviors of C2 servers with respect to their spatiotemporal patterns and behaviors. First, we successfully mine Twitter and GitHub and identify C2 servers with a precision of 97% and 94%, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the threat feeds identify only 24% of the servers in our database, with Twitter and GitHub providing 32%. A surprising observation is the identification of 250 IP addresses, each of which hosts more than 5 C2 servers for different botnet families at the same time. Overall, we envision C2Store as an ongoing effort that will facilitate research by providing timely, historical, and comprehensive C2 server information by critically combining multiple sources of information.}

Unlike all prior systems, DanBlue leverages ambient Bluetooth signals of various frequencies to backscatter in the standard Bluetooth-hopping way. To do so, we first introduce an edge proxy to identify uncontrolled ambient Bluetooth signals. Then, we design a wideband channel hopping to enable fast frequency shifts for low-power tags, empowering backscatter hopping much like active Bluetooth hopping. We prototype the DanBlue tag using off-the-shelf FPGAs and the DanBlue edge with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) chips. Through comprehensive field studies, we show that DanBlue supports hopping from any-frequency Bluetooth excitations to any-frequency Bluetooth channels. Furthermore, the accuracy of frequency identification is as high as 99% with less than 7.1 ms latency. For the first time, we demonstrate DanBlue can emulate the Bluetooth protocol stack and seamlessly build connectivity with multiple active Bluetooth radios. We believe DanBlue is taking a crucial step forward on fully functioning battery-free Bluetooth.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study on the deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in urban environments with poor radio coverage. We focus on the city of London, a large metropolis where radio network planning presents unique challenges due to diverse geographical and structural features. Using crowd-sourced datasets, we analyze the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) from end-user devices to understand the existing radio coverage landscape of a major Mobile Network Operator (MNO). Our study identifies areas with poor coverage and proposes the deployment of RIS to enhance signal strength and coverage. We selected a set of potential sites for RIS deployment and, combining data from the MNO, data extracted from a real RIS prototype, and a ray-tracing tool, we analyzed the gains of this novel technology with respect to deploying more conventional technologies in terms of RSRP, coverage, and cost-efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven analysis of the cost-efficiency of RIS technology in the production of urban networks. Our findings provide compelling evidence about the potential of RIS as a cost-efficient solution for enhancing radio coverage in complex urban mobile networks. More specifically, our results indicate that large-scale RIS technology, when applied in real-world urban mobile network scenarios, can achieve 72% of the coverage gains attainable by deploying additional cells with only 22% of their Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) over a 5-year timespan. Consequently, RIS technology offers around 3x higher cost-efficiency than other more conventional coverage-enhancing technologies.}

	abstract = {Volumetric Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been a severe threat to the Internet for more than two decades. Some success in mitigation has been achieved based on numerous defensive techniques created by the research community, implemented by the industry, and deployed by network operators. However, evolution is not a privilege of mitigations, and DDoS attackers have found better strategies and continue to cause harm. A key challenge in winning this race is understanding the various characteristics of DDoS attacks in network traffic at scale and in a realistic manner. In this paper, we propose DDoS2Vec, a novel approach to characterise DDoS attacks in real-world Internet traffic using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. DDoS2Vec is a domain-specific application of Latent Semantic Analysis that learns vector representations of potential DDoS attacks. We look into the link between natural language and computer network communication in a way that has not been previously studied. Our approach is evaluated on a large-scale dataset of flow samples collected from an Internet eXchange Point (IXP) in one year. We evaluate the performance of DDoS2Vec via multi-label classification in a Machine Learning (ML) scenario. DDoS2Vec characterises DDoS attacks more clearly than other baselines - including NLP-based approaches inspired by recent networks research and a basic non-NLP solution.}

	abstract = {In-network computing provides significant performance benefits, load reduction, and power savings. Still, an in-network service's functionality is strictly limited to a single hardware device. Research has focused on enabling on-device functionality, with limited consideration to distributed in-network computing. This paper explores the applicability of distributed computing to in-network computing. We present DINC, a framework enabling distributed in-network computing, generating deployment strategies, overcoming resource constraints and providing functionality guarantees across a network. It uses multi-objective optimization to provide a deployment strategy, slicing P4 programs accordingly. DINC was evaluated using seven different workloads on both data center and wide-area network topologies, demonstrating feasibility and scalability, providing efficient distribution plans within seconds.}

	abstract = {Cloud providers are highly incentivized to reduce latency. One way they do this is by locating data centers as close to users as possible. These “cloud edge” data centers are placed in metropolitan areas and enable edge computing for residents of these cities. Therefore, which cities are selected to host edge data centers determines who has the fastest access to applications requiring edge compute — creating a digital divide between those closest and furthest from the edge. In this study we measure latency to the current and predicted cloud edge of three major cloud providers around the world. Our measurements use the RIPE Atlas platform targeting cloud regions, AWS Local Zones, and network optimization services that minimize the path to the cloud edge. An analysis of the digital divide shows rising inequality as the relative difference between users closest and farthest from cloud compute increases. We also find this inequality unfairly affects lower income census tracts in the US. This result is extended globally using remotely sensed night time lights as a proxy for wealth. Finally, we demonstrate that low earth orbit satellite internet can help to close this digital divide and provide more fair access to the cloud edge.}

The traditional QoE modeling for video streaming applications builds a one-size-fits-all QoE model that underserves atypical viewers who perceive QoE differently. To address the problem of atypical viewers, this paper proposes iQoE (individualized QoE), a method that employs explicit, expressible, and actionable feedback from a viewer to construct a personalized QoE model for this viewer. The iterative iQoE design exercises active learning and combines a novel sampler with a modeler. The chief emphasis of our paper is on making iQoE sample-efficient and accurate. By leveraging the Microworkers crowdsourcing platform, we conduct studies with 120 subjects who provide 14,400 individual scores. According to the subjective studies, a session of about 22 minutes empowers a viewer to construct a personalized QoE model that, compared to the best of the 10 baseline models, delivers the average accuracy improvement of at least 42% for all viewers and at least 85% for the atypical viewers. The large-scale simulations based on a new technique of synthetic profiling expand the evaluation scope by exploring iQoE design choices, parameter sensitivity, and generalizability.}

	abstract = {Anonymous communication systems are essential tools for preserving privacy and freedom of expression. However, traffic analysis attacks make it challenging to maintain unlinkability in circuit-based anonymity networks like Tor, enabling adversaries to deanonymize communications. To address this problem, we introduce k-funnel, a new security primitive that enhances the unlinkability of circuit-based anonymity networks, and we present BriK, a Tor pluggable transport that implements k-funnels. k-Funnels offer k-anonymity to a group of k clients by jointly tunneling their circuits' traffic through a bridge while ensuring that the client-generated flows are indistinguishable. BriK incorporates several defense mechanisms against traffic analysis attacks, including traffic shaping schemes, synchronization protocols, and approaches for monitoring exposure to statistical disclosure attacks. Our evaluation shows that BriK is able to support web browsing and video streaming while offering k-anonymity. We evaluate the security of BriK against traffic correlation attacks leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers without considering auxiliary information and find it highly resistant. Although k-funnels require the cooperation of mutually trusted clients, limiting their coordination, our work presents a new practical solution to strengthen unlinkability in circuit-based anonymity systems.}

These self-optimize the network through programmable, closed-loop control, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) routines. In this context, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown great potential in addressing complex resource allocation problems. However, DRL-based solutions are inherently hard to explain, which hinders their deployment and use in practice. In this paper, we propose EXPLORA, a framework that provides explainability of DRL-based control solutions for the Open RAN ecosystem. EXPLORA synthesizes network-oriented explanations based on an attributed graph that produces a link between the actions taken by a DRL agent (i.e., the nodes of the graph) and the input state space (i.e., the attributes of each node). This novel approach allows EXPLORA to explain models by providing information on the wireless context in which the DRL agent operates. EXPLORA is also designed to be lightweight for real-time operation. We prototype EXPLORA and test it experimentally on an O-RAN-compliant near-real-time RIC deployed on the Colosseum wireless network emulator. We evaluate EXPLORA for agents trained for different purposes and showcase how it generates clear network-oriented explanations. We also show how explanations can be used to perform informative and targeted intent-based action steering and achieve median transmission bitrate improvements of 4% and tail improvements of 10%.}

This work sheds light on the benefits of carbon aware networks, by exploring a set of potential carbon-related metrics and their use to define link-cost in carbon-aware link-state routing algorithms. Using realistic network topologies, traffic patterns and grid carbon intensity, we identify useful metrics and limitations to carbon emissions reduction. Consequently, a new heuristic carbon-aware traffic engineering algorithm, CATE, is proposed. CATE takes advantage of carbon intensity and routers' dynamic power consumption, combined with ports power down, to minimize carbon emissions. Our results show that there is no silver bullet to significant carbon reductions, yet there are promising directions without changes to existing routers' hardware.}

	abstract = {Research has shown that Multipath TCP (MPTCP) improves the quality of a TCP connection by exploiting multiple paths, but its adoption in the wide area network is still fledgling. While MPTCP-TCP proxying is often employed as a practical solution, the performance of a split-connection proxy is suboptimal – it wastes CPU cycles on content relaying between two connections while it does not efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores in packet processing. We present FlexCP, a high-performance MPTCP-TCP proxy based on the following properties. First, FlexCP operates by translating the two protocols on a packet level. This approach not only avoids the overhead of flow reassembly and memory copying, but it greatly simplifies the implementation as the proxy stays away from reliable data transfer, socket buffer management, and per-hop congestion/flow control. Second, FlexCP maintains connection-to-core affinity for multiple subflows of the same MPTCP connection and its corresponding TCP connection by leveraging SmartNIC. This enables a lock-free implementation for packet processing, which significantly improves the performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlexCP achieves 281 Gbps of connection proxying on a single machine, outperforming existing proxies by up to 6.3× in terms of throughput while it incurs little extra latency over direct TCP/MPTCP connections.}

	abstract = {Modern networks are increasingly using layering and bridging to form a compositional architecture. Layering protocols like VXLAN create multiple overlay networks on top of a single underlay network infrastructure. This makes network configurations even more complex, and error-prone. To check the correctness of such compositional networks, one needs to model the dependency across multiple layers (underlay and overlay) and multiple domains (different VPNs/VPCs). Existing verifiers, which are optimized to scale in single-layer single-domain networks, exhibit scalability limitations when applied to compositional networks. This paper proposes MNV, a modular network verifier that scales to large compositional networks. At its core is a new verification method termed decompose-merge reasoning, which decomposes the network into self-contained modules, verifies each module independently, and merges the verification results. Our experiments show that for a typical data center network virtualized with VXLAN, to check reachability for more than 100 million pairs of subnets, MNV is at least 100x faster than state-of-the-art tools.}

	abstract = {Internet-wide scans are an important tool to evaluate the deployment of services. To enable large-scale application layer scans, a fast, stateless port scan (e.g., using ZMap) is often performed ahead of time to collect responsive targets. It is a common expectation that port scans on the entire IPv4 address space provide a relatively unbiased view as they cover the complete address space. Previous work, however, has found prefixes where all addresses share particular properties. In IPv6, aliased prefixes and fully responsive prefixes, i.e., prefixes where all addresses are responsive, are a well-known phenomenon. However, there is no such in-depth analysis for prefixes with these responsiveness patterns in IPv4. This paper delves into the underlying factors of this phenomenon in the context of IPv4 and evaluates port scans on a total of 161 ports (142 TCP & 19 UDP ports) from three different vantage points. To account for packet loss and other scanning artifacts, we propose the notion of a new category of prefixes, which we call highly responsive prefixes (HRPs). Our findings show that the share of HRPs can make up 70% of responsive addresses on selected ports. Regarding specific ports, we observe that CDNs contribute to the largest fraction of HRPs on TCP/80 and TCP/443, while TCP proxies emerge as the primary cause of HRPs on other ports. Our analysis also reveals that application layer handshakes to targets outside HRPs are, depending on the chosen service, up to three times more likely to be successful compared to handshakes with targets located in HRPs. To improve future scanning campaigns conducted by the research community, we make our study's data publicly available and provide a tool for detecting HRPs. Furthermore, we propose an approach for a more efficient, ethical, and sustainable application layer target selection. We demonstrate that our approach has the potential to reduce the number of TLS handshakes by up to 75% during an Internet-wide scan while successfully obtaining 99 % of all unique certificates.}

	abstract = {Bursts, sudden surges in network utilization, are a significant root cause of packet loss and high latency in datacenters. Packet deflection, re-routing packets that arrive at a local hotspot to neighboring switches, is shown to be a potent countermeasure against bursts. Unfortunately, existing deflection techniques cannot be implemented in today's datacenter switches. This is because, to minimize packet drops and remain effective under extreme load, existing deflection techniques rely on certain hardware primitives (e.g., extracting packets from arbitrary locations in the queue) that datacenter switches do not support. In this paper, we address the implementability hurdles of packet deflection. This paper proposes heuristics for approximating state-of-the-art deflection techniques in programmable switches. We introduce Simple Deflection which deflects excess traffic to randomly selected, non-congested ports and Preemptive Deflection (PD) in which switches identify the packets likely to be selected for deflection and preemptively deflect them before they are enqueued. We implement and evaluate our techniques on a testbed with Intel Tofino switches. Our testbed evaluations show that Simple and Preemptive Deflection improve the 99th percentile response times by 8× and 425×, respectively, compared to a baseline drop-tail queue under 90% load. Using large-scale network simulations, we show that the performance of our algorithms is close to the deflection techniques that they intend to approximate, e.g., PD achieves 4% lower 99th percentile query completion times (QCT) than Vertigo, a recent deflection technique that cannot be implemented in off-the-shelf switches, and 2.5× lower QCT than ECMP under 95% load.}

	abstract = {The TLS ecosystem depends on certificates to bootstrap secure connections. Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted to issue these correctly. However, as a result of security breaches or attacks, certificates may be issued fraudulently and need to be revoked prematurely. Revocation, as a reactive measure, is fundamentally damage control and, as such, time is critical. Therefore, measuring reaction delay is the first step to identifying how well the revocation system functions. In this paper we attempt to characterize the current performance of the WebPKI in dealing with fraudulent certificates. We present measurements of each step in the revocation process: the detection of certificate issuance through Certificate Transparency (CT) monitoring, the administrative revocation process at popular CAs, and the revocation checking behavior of end-user clients, both in a controlled virtualized environment and in the wild. We perform two live measurements, in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to provide a longitudinal comparison. We find that detection and revocation of fraudulent certificates is quick and efficient when leveraging CT and can be completed within 6.5 hours on average. Furthermore, CT is being increasingly enforced by some browsers. However, ∼83% of the clients we observed, across popular browsers, brands and OSes, completely disregard a certificate's status, whileall of the studied browsers still display soft-fail behavior, making them vulnerable to attackers capable of interfering with the network. Of the clients that do check revocation, we find that 35% can be made to accept a revoked certificate through the use of OCSP Stapling. We expect this number to grow with client-side adoption of OCSP Stapling [RFC6961]. Current OCSP expiration times allow a revoked certificate to remain fully valid for up to 7 days for the majority of CAs, exposing clients to attacks.}

	abstract = {Accurate per-flow monitoring is critical for precise network diagnosis, performance analysis, and network operation and management in general. However, the limited amount of memory available on modern programmable devices and the large number of active flows force practitioners to monitor only the most relevant flows with approximate data structures, limiting their view of network traffic. We argue that, due to the skewed nature of network traffic, such data structures are, in practice, heavily underutilized, i.e. sparse, thus wasting a significant amount of memory. This paper proposes a Sparse Approximate Data Structure (SPADA) representation that leverages sparsity to reduce the memory footprint of per-flow monitoring systems in the data plane while preserving their original accuracy. SPADA representation can be integrated into a generic per-flow monitoring system and is suitable for several measurement use cases. We prototype SPADA in P4 for a commercial FPGA target and test our approach with a custom simulator that we make publicly available, on four real network traces over three different monitoring tasks. Our results show that SPADA achieves 2× to 11× memory footprint reduction with respect to the state-of-the-art while maintaining the same accuracy, or even improving it.}
