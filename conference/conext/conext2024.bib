	abstract = {The DMARC reporting system enables domain name owners to receive failure and aggregate reports from email receivers to get insight into email authentication failures or unauthorized domain usage and take measures against phishing and spoofing attacks. In this paper, we test DMARC reporting of main Email Service Providers (ESPs) and show that most of them do not comply with the RFC specification, especially with respect to the generation of failure reports and external destination verification. We also analyze more than 40,000 DMARC aggregate reports and show that 94.93% of them do not follow the correct report syntax defined in RFC 7489. Finally, we provide recommendations for improving the DMARC reporting strategy.}

	abstract = {The significant demand for high-quality video streaming, and the wide proliferation of this application in entertainment, education and communication, has created an urgent need for methods that ensure user Quality of Experience (QoE). Traditional approaches for predicting video playback quality have focused on fine-grained network layer features, which can be computationally intensive and require extensive data collection. To reduce the high computation demand and data collection requirements, we propose to use machine learning methods to predict mean video playback bitrate using coarse-grained features derived from real-time packet scheduling priority weights. Although coarse-grained features alone may not always perform optimally due to data ambiguity, they can still enable meaningful predictions in specific contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of coarse-grained features and their ability to predict video streaming QoE. To do so, we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based filtering technique to identify regions where the model performs well. Our evaluation shows that while our model initially achieves a 56% macro-average F1 score for the entire dataset, it reaches an 81% macro-average F1 score with the filtered subset of data. This approach highlights the potential of coarse-grained features for accurate QoE estimation by identifying the regions of the dataset where these features possess sufficient discriminative power, thereby enhancing domain knowledge and the trustworthiness of model outputs.}

We propose a serialization library that leverages the kernel scatter-gather communication primitives to reduce serialization data copy costs without using custom hardware or a custom network stack.}

	abstract = {Obtaining an accurate, explainable, Internet-scale IP geolocation dataset has been a longstanding goal of the research community. Despite decades of research on IP geolocation, no current technique can provide such a dataset. In particular, latency-based geolocation techniques do not scale, because, on one hand, we have thousands of available vantage points to perform measurements, but on the other hand, we have no way to select the right ones for each IP address. In this paper, we present GeoResolver, an efficient vantage point selection methodology, based on the assumption that two IP addresses that share a similar DNS redirection are likely to be geographically close together. GeoResolver performs nearly as well as a brute force approach using all the vantage points, geolocating 94% of the targets that could actually be geolocated at metro level by using all the vantage points, while using 4.3% of the probing budget compared to a state-of-the-art technique. We carefully design GeoResolver to be both accurate and scalable and with our implementation, we start a large-scale geolocation campaign.}

Since Named Data Networking (NDN) has a stateful data plane that can detect and mitigate packet loops, we design a DV routing protocol over NDN, ndn-dv, and demonstrate that an NDN network running ndn-dv can prevent traffic disruptions in the face of dynamic network topology changes due to failures.}

This paper investigates energy consumption issues from widespread 5G deployment using city-scale real-world mobile network data. Our dataset includes traffic volume, energy consumption, and base station attributes spanning May 2022, July 2023, and April 2024, covering over 10,000 4G and 5,000 5G base stations. A portion of the dataset is published on GitHub. We develop high-accuracy models to profile 4G and 5G base station energy consumption, revealing 5G inefficiencies under low traffic loads. We identify energy efficiency traps where network energy efficiency drops post-5G deployment. Our study estimates the recovery time from energy efficiency traps, emphasizes that different functional regions have varying recovery levels, and analyzes the reasons for these differences. We provide recommendations for deploying and commercializing 5G to promote sustainable connectivity.}

Lack of Internet access hinders economic growth, educational opportunities, and access to information and services. Recent initiatives to "connect the unconnected" have either failed (project Loon and Aquila) or are characterized by exorbitant costs (Starlink and similar), which are unsustainable for users in developing regions. This paper proposes SONIC, a novel connectivity solution that repurposes a widespread communication infrastructure (AM/FM radio) to deliver access to pre-rendered webpages. Our rationale is threefold: 1) the radio network is widely accessible -- currently reaching 70% of the world -- even in developing countries, 2) unused frequencies are highly available, 3) while data over sound can be slow, when combined with the radio network, it takes advantage of its broadcast nature, efficiently reaching a large number of users. We have designed and built a proof-of-concept for SONIC, which shows encouraging initial results.}

	abstract = {Among several proposals for a privacy-preserving replacement of third-party cookies, Google's new Topics API is widely discussed as a possible solution. Some scepticism still lingers on the new paradigm from researchers and control bodies; however, the industry has started deploying and testing it. This paper measures the current usage of the Topics API in the wild, discovering third parties that started enabling it, the practices they adopt and their interplay with privacy policies and consent acquisition mechanisms. To do so, we deploy a crawler to record the usage of Topics API on the most popular 50,000 websites worldwide. We observe that this technology starts to get a foothold - with 47 popular ad-related third parties that are testing it to understand the opportunities it offers. We notably observe typical problems of early deployments: privacy regulation violations, unexpected solutions that allow one to circumvent abuse protection, and deployment errors.}

	abstract = {Deploying machine learning (ML) models in programmable switch data planes facilitates low latency and high throughput traffic inference at line speed. However, data planes pose significant constraints due to the limited memory and minimal support for mathematical operations and data types. As a result, the only unsupervised ML models implemented in data planes to date are Isolation Forests (iForests). However, conventional iForest models yield suboptimal malicious traffic detection performance in various traffic use cases. To address this limitation, this paper proposes iGuard, the first iForest implementation that can accurately detect malicious traffic by incorporating the "knowledge" of more powerful autoencoders. We deploy iGuard in the form of a small set of whitelist rules that could be easily installed in the switch data planes. We implement iGuard using the P4 language, and assess its performance in an experimental platform based on Intel Tofino switches. Upon evaluating iGuard on various attack traffic use cases, our model can improve accuracy up to 48.3% while maintaining a similar or lower switch memory footprint over previous approaches to implement iForest models in real-world equipment.}

	abstract = {During the TLS 1.3 handshake, an entity (e.g., a client application) commonly transmits a chain of certificates and certificates' digital signatures to the remote party to authenticate themselves. Towards a transition to post-quantum TLS, several proposals have been made to switch to post-quantum digital signatures in these certificate chains. Since post-quantum digital signatures are much larger than those based on classical assumptions, there has been a significant line of work aiming to reduce the overhead required for post-quantum authentication. Notably, the privacy implications of the proposed changes to the authentication system in TLS have not been thoroughly evaluated. Several of these proposals suggest Intermediate Certificate Authority (ICA) suppression, in which certificates that are already known to the client can be removed from the certificate chain to reduce the communication cost. One approach uses probabilistic data structures to transmit this information; however, this technique introduces additional privacy leakage, revealing to the server all ICAs whose certificates the client used to authenticate one of their past connections. In this work, we evaluate the privacy implications of taking such approaches to ICA suppression and the severity of its impact on TLS clients. In doing so, we perform an exploratory analysis on the current state of certificate-based PKI, particularly focusing on the distribution of ICAs. We define an adversarial model and a set of experiments to concretely evaluate the privacy leakage under the outlined assumptions. Our work suggests there is a risk in including this additional vector of information to adversarial servers aiming to execute website fingerprinting attacks.}

	abstract = {NextG cellular networks are designed to meet Quality of Service requirements for various applications in and beyond smartphones and mobile devices. However, lacking introspection into the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN application and transport layer designers are ill-poised to cope with the vagaries of the wireless last hop to a mobile client, while 5G network operators run mostly closed networks, limiting their potential for co-design with the wider internet and user applications. This paper presents NR-Scope, a passive, incrementally-deployable, and independently-deployable Standalone 5G network telemetry system that can stream fine-grained RAN capacity, latency, and retransmission information to application servers to enable better millisecond scale, application-level decisions on offered load and bit rate adaptation than end-to-end latency measurements or end-to-end packet losses currently permit. Our experimental evaluation on various 5G Standalone base stations demonstrates NR-Scope can achieve less than 0.1% throughput error estimation for every UE in a RAN.
