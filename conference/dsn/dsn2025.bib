	abstract = {Hybrid broadcast broadband television (HbbTV) is an evolving technology that connects linear TV with modern HTML5 applications, delivering extras like games, videos, and online shopping. However, its bidirectional transmission functionality raises privacy concerns, as it introduces new tracking methods for TV channels. While previous studies focused on security issues or user awareness of HbbTV privacy challenges, a detailed examination of the tracking and transparency mechanisms of the HbbTV ecosystem is still missing. This study fills this gap by extensively analyzing these features within the European HbbTV ecosystem, and in particular within German-language TV channels. We monitored more than 350 TV channels for over 400 hours, evaluating 1) prevalent HbbTV tracking methods, 2) consent notice prevalence and user interactions, and 3) privacy policy disclosures. Our findings indicate that the HbbTV tracking system operates independently of the Web, consent notices exploit system constraints to influence users, and privacy policies often do not align with actual data practices.}

	abstract = {We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates expensive cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric memory-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert channels that leverage different PiM approaches (i.e., processing-near-memory and processing-using-memory) to establish high-throughput covert communication channels. Our covert channels achieve 8.2 Mb/s and 14.8 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is 3.6 × and 6.5 × higher than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channel. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently-running victim applications with a low error rate.

	abstract = {Synthetic data has emerged as a promising avenue for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, constructing synthetic data generators necessitates access to the real dataset, posing challenges, particularly when data features are disparately distributed across different organizations. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative approach to training machine learning models among distinct tabular data holders, such as financial institutions, who possess disjoint features for the same group of customers. In this paper, we introduce the GTV framework for Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning and demonstrate that VFL can be successfully used to implement GANs for distributed tabular data in a privacy-preserving manner, with performance close to centralized GANs which assume shared data. We make design choices with respect to the distribution of GAN generator and discriminator models, and we introduce a training-with-shuffling technique so that no party can reconstruct training data from the GAN conditional vector. The paper presents (1) an implementation of GTV, (2) a detailed quality evaluation of GTV-generated synthetic data, (3) an examination of the GTV framework for different data distributions and number of clients, and (4) an analysis of GTV’s robustness against Membership Inference Attacks with different settings of Differential Privacy, for a range of datasets with diverse distribution characteristics. Our results demonstrate that GTV can consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable quality to that generated by a centralized GAN algorithm. The difference in machine learning utility can be as low as 2.7%, even under extremely imbalanced data distributions across clients. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhao-zilong/gtv}

	abstract = {Binary code search is critical for applications such as plagiarism detection and security analysis, but it is challenging due to compiler-induced transformations at different optimization levels. Existing function similarity methods often fail in large-scale search scenarios, particularly pairwise approaches that struggle with scalability. To address this, we propose BASSET, a novel framework that leverages multilevel hybrid semantic features for efficient large-scale binary function clone search. BASSET decomposes functions into five semantic units and applies various embedding strategies to generate indexing vectors for similarity measurement. Notably, it integrates an expression tree-based representation to capture robust features across compiler optimization levels. By utilizing a learning-to-rank approach with convolutional neural networks, BASSET combines similarity scores from different semantic units to generate a final ranking. Experimental results show that BASSET outperforms existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.992, an nDCG@10 of 0.853, and a stable MRR of 59%, even as the search space grows.}

However, evaluations of NIDS often assume offline training, supervised learning, or static concepts, which do not accurately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we critically assess the performance of current NIDS and outlier detectors under a realistic threat model that uses online training, unsupervised learning, and is concept drift-prone. We find that conventional feature extractors struggle in diverse real-life environments. To overcome this, we propose LAGER, a novel feature extractor utilizing graph neural networks to extract representative features from a layer-wise graph representation of the network. Our results demonstrate that LAGER enhances the detection accuracy and adaptability to concept drifts for a wide range of NIDS and lays a solid foundation for robust network feature extraction.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, with vertical federated learning (VFL) particularly useful for non-competing organizations with vertically partitioned data. However, existing VFL protocols often assume honest-but-curious behavior, making them vulnerable to malicious actions. Active parties may manipulate gradients, either to save resources or for malicious purposes, while passive parties can launch direct label inference attacks using sample-level gradients. To address these issues, we introduce VerifyVFL, the first practical verifiable neural network-based VFL scheme. Using homomorphic hashing and bilinear pairing, VerifyVFL generates signatures for local model outputs and provides gradient proofs, allowing data owners to verify received gradients. Random masks further protect sensitive sample-level gradients from passive parties. The scheme ensures low overhead, with constant signature and proof sizes, and requires solving an NP-hard problem to forge proofs. Experimental results confirm VerifyVFL’s practical performance, with constant additional overhead.}

	abstract = {Declarative specification languages like Alloy are critical for modeling and verifying complex software systems, yet repairing these specifications remains a significant challenge for ensuring software dependability. This study conducts the first comprehensive empirical evaluation comparing traditional systematic repair techniques with emerging Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches across two established benchmarks, analyzing over 1,900 Alloy specifications. By systematically analyzing repair success rates, ground truth similarity, and repair generation strategies, we reveal nuanced performance characteristics of different repair methodologies. Our findings demonstrate that while traditional tools excel in systematic fault localization and achieving high ground truth similarity, LLM-based techniques—particularly multi-round prompting approaches—offer unique capabilities in addressing complex specification errors, with some hybrid approaches achieving repair rates of up to 85.5%. Critically, we show that integrating traditional fault localization techniques with LLM-based repair strategies can significantly enhance overall repair effectiveness and specification dependability. This research provides a large-scale empirical evaluation of how various Alloy repair techniques work in synergy, offering valuable insights that chart a promising path for future automated specification repair approaches and contribute to the development of more reliable and secure software systems.}

We propose PTC (Prefix Tuning CodeT5), a novel method leveraging prefix tuning on the CodeT5 model to generate secure, functionally correct scripts without full retraining. PTC introduces a security-oriented loss function to enhance code correctness and security compliance, reducing vulnerabilities while meeting functional requirements. We evaluate PTC on several groups of targets, and results show that our solution outperforms baseline models, producing secure and functional network measurement scripts across various scenarios.

	abstract = {Existing registration, discovery, and authorization mechanisms in the 5G core control plane present scalability and efficiency challenges. As cellular deployments scale to accommodate diverse user demands, the 5G core control plane suffers from increased inter-Virtual Network Function (VNF) communication latency, thus deteriorating the reliability of critical procedures. To address this problem, we propose 5G-STREAM (Service mesh Tailored for Reliable, Efficient, and Authorized Microservices) to optimize control plane traffic in distributed cloud environments by establishing a topology awareness of service chains across cloud hierarchies. Leveraging this awareness, 5G-STREAM dynamically configures communication pathways to reduce discovery and authorization signaling overhead, thus increasing the reliability of inter-VNF communication. We develop a prototype of 5G-STREAM and evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that 5G-STREAM significantly reduces the process completion time in core service chains by up to 2× inter VNF-Network Repository Function (NRF) latency per transaction, with more pronounced benefits in larger service chains. Furthermore, we show that the cost required to deploy 5G-STREAM is an additional 0.1 USD/hr on AWS for a VNF handling a sustained rate of 50,000 requests/minute.}

	abstract = {Reverse engineering is a crucial technique in software security, enabling professionals to analyze malware, identify vulnerabilities, and patch legacy software without access to source code. Although decompilers attempt to reconstruct high-level code from binaries, essential information, such as variable names and types, is often dissimilar from the original version, hindering readability and comprehension.Recent advancements have employed AI to enhance decompiler output by recovering original variable names and types. Traditional evaluation of recovery techniques relies on measuring similarity between original and recovered names, assuming that higher similarity enhances readability. However, studies suggest that these "intrinsic" metrics may not accurately predict "extrinsic" outcomes like user comprehension or task performance, revealing a gap in understanding readability and cognitive load in reverse engineering.This paper presents an extrinsic evaluation of machine-generated variable and type names, focusing on their impact on reverse engineers’ comprehension of decompiled code. We conducted a user study with 40 participants—including students and professionals—to assess code comprehension both with and without AI-generated variable and type name assistance. Our findings indicate a lack of correlation between traditional machine learning metrics and actual comprehension gains, highlighting limitations in current evaluation techniques. Despite this, participants showed a preference for AI-augmented decompiler outputs. These insights contribute to understanding the effectiveness of automatic recovery techniques in enhancing reverse engineering tasks and underscore the need for comprehensive, user-centered evaluation frameworks.}

Their popularity and high trading activity led to serious scalability issues in terms of throughput and state size. In this paper, we address these challenges by utilizing a new sidechain architecture, building a system called ammBoost. ammBoost reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs, including a functionality-split and layer 2 traffic summarization paradigm, an epoch-based deposit mechanism, and pool snapshot-based and delayed token-payout trading. We also build a proof-of-concept for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 96.05% and the chain growth by at least 93.42%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume of Uniswap.}

	abstract = {Designing reconfiguration schemes for consensus protocols is challenging because subtle corner cases during reconfiguration could invalidate the correctness of the protocol. Thus, most systems that embed consensus protocols conservatively implement the reconfiguration and refrain from developing an efficient scheme. Existing implementations often stop the entire system during reconfiguration and rely on a centralized coordinator, which can become a single point of failure. We present ReCraft, a novel reconfiguration protocol for Raft, which supports multi- and single-cluster-level reconfigurations. ReCraft does not rely on external coordinators and blocks minimally. ReCraft enables the sharding of Raft clusters with split and merge reconfigurations and adds a membership change scheme that improves Raft. We prove the safety and liveness of ReCraft and demonstrate its efficiency through implementations in etcd.}

	abstract = {In masked language model (MLM) based attacks, candidate adversarial examples are flexibly generated according to the context, but how to balance imperceptibility and success rate of attacks remains a challenge. To pursue imperceptibility, external semantic constraints are imposed on candidate word generation, whereby the search space is restricted and the success rate of attacks drops. To address this issue, a semantically improved adversarial attack denoted by SAM-CP is proposed by generating high-quality candidate words satisfying the semantic constraints. In particular, linguistic constraints are adopted so that high-quality semantic candidates can be generated as fine-tuning labels instead of manual annotation. Extensive experimental results on three open-source datasets demonstrate that SAM-CP significantly improves the semantic consistency of generated adversarial samples by adopting different MLMs, respectively. Without compromising text quality, the ability to use SAM-CP to deceive state-of-the-art text classifiers is evaluated. Visit https://github.com/HugoTianX/SAM-CP for details and codes.}

	abstract = {Crawlers are critical for ensuring the dependability and security of web applications by maximizing the code coverage of testing tools. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach to improve crawler exploration. However, existing approaches based on Q-learning face two major limitations: being state-based, they rely on brittle state abstractions that fail to generalize across diverse applications, and they employ rewards that prioritize underused actions but are not necessarily proportional to the improvement in code coverage. In this paper, we first substantiate the limitations of two popular Q-learning-based crawlers. We then propose Multi-Armed Krawler (MAK), a new crawler based on the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit problem. MAK is stateless and does not require the definition of brittle state abstractions that do not generalize to new web applications. By modeling the crawling process through a traditional graph abstraction and introducing an extrinsic reward correlated with code coverage, MAK compensates for the loss of expressiveness coming from its stateless nature. Our experimental results on public web applications show that MAK achieves greater coverage and faster convergence than its counterparts.}

In this paper, we introduce ICS Tracker, a comprehensive approach that addresses these gaps by using digital twins to collect logs, automatically recovering physical semantics, reconstructing data dependencies, and linking controller operations to OS-level events. Tested on ten attack scenarios across two testbeds, ICSTracker outperforms previous methods, capturing all attack activities where earlier techniques missed 56%.}

	abstract = {Coding standards for secure programming recommend "scrubbing" sensitive data once it is no longer needed; otherwise, secrets may be recovered, as illustrated in the Heartbleed attack. Despite being an effective software-based countermeasure, zeroization, i.e., overwriting with zeroes, turns out to be challenging and error-prone. Current verification approaches suffer from scalability or precision issues when applied to production software in practice. In this paper, we put forward the GCC Static Analyzer (GSA), which is a symbolic execution engine for error finding. Specifically, we extend the GSA to build GnuZero; our automated tool that detects missing zeroization for all stack/heap variables storing sensitive data, either directly or by derivation. Our experiments confirm GnuZero efficiency and effectiveness in verifying real-world benchmarks. In particular, GnuZero passes all the relevant Juliet’s test programs, namely associated to the MITRE’s CWE-244 and CWE-226. In addition, GnuZero succeeds in identifying new vulnerabilities in open-source cryptographic modules.}

	abstract = {The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized computing engine. It enables the Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The increasing adoption of Ethereum sparked the rise of phishing activities. Phishing attacks often target users through deceptive means, e.g., fake websites, wallet scams, or malicious smart contracts, aiming to steal sensitive information or funds. A timely detection of phishing activities in the EVM is therefore crucial to preserve the user trust and network integrity. Some state-of-the art approaches to phishing detection in smart contracts rely on the online analysis of transactions and their traces. However, replaying transactions often exposes sensitive user data and interactions, with several security concerns. In this work, we present PhishingHook, a framework that applies machine learning techniques to detect phishing activities in smart contracts by directly analyzing the contract’s bytecode and its constituent opcodes. We evaluate the efficacy of such techniques in identifying malicious patterns, suspicious function calls, or anomalous behaviors within the contract’s code itself before it is deployed or interacted with. We experimentally compare 16 techniques, belonging to four main categories (Histogram Similarity Classifiers, Vision Models, Language Models and Vulnerability Detection Models), using 7,000 real-world malware smart contracts. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of PhishingHook in performing phishing classification systems, with about 90% average accuracy among all the models. We support experimental reproducibility, and we release our code and datasets to the research community.}

	abstract = {With the increasing complexity of Integrated Circuit design and the globalization of the supply chain, the threat posed by Hardware Trojans is becoming increasingly significant. Currently, HT detection methods based on graph neural networks demonstrate the most promising performance. However, existing GNN-based methods fail to capture global representations and edge distinctiveness, and their corresponding sampling methods are not sufficiently efficient, resulting in a low F1 score. We propose GREAT, a detection framework that accurately locates Trojans in gate-level netlists. GREAT leverages feature fusion technology to mitigate the deficiency in global representation inherent in GNN. We introduce Wire Encoding, which assigns a unique identifier to each edge, enhancing sensitivity to shared wires. Additionally, GREAT incorporates a novel graph sampling technique to reduce resource consumption and improve training efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the GREAT has achieved a recall of 94.58% and an F1 score of 96.18%, surpassing all existing HT detection methods on gate-level netlists.}

Detecting short-duration attack steps, also known as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), has proven effective in assisting APT detection. However, existing incremental matching tools lack support for high-level pattern semantics, such as frequency and flow, causing potential inefficiency and evasion by slightly changing attack operations. To address this, we propose a feasible solution called IPMES+ 1 , which incorporates intricate designs and optimizations. IPMES+ is the first TTP detection tool to provide incremental time-constrained graph-based pattern matching with frequency and flow semantics. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IPMES+ is not only necessary and feasible for enhancing practical TTP detection but also superior to existing tools that lack these advanced capabilities.}

Current solutions, such as Keylime, rely on Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Linux’s Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) but often struggle to balance minimizing false alerts and maintaining effective threat detection. In this paper, we examine common causes of attestation failures in Keylime through active experiments. We find that false positives often stem from unscheduled OS updates, and we propose a dynamic policy generation scheme as a solution (validated over 66 days of experiments). Our false negative experiments reveal vulnerabilities in existing designs, including five common issues across Keylime and IMA. Exploiting these issues, attackers could evade detection in all tested scenarios. Our findings offer insights into common failures of continuous integrity attestation, and our proposed solution is being integrated into Keylime with community support, enhancing cloud security.

	abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is designed to be distributed, which aims to provide services with low latency and great reliability. However, after decades of development and changes in Internet business models, various aspects of the DNS ecosystem have begun to show signs of centralization. To investigate the centralization from the viewpoint of hosting service providers, we develop an automated method based on similarity among NS domains and co-hosting relationship to identify the hosting providers for authoritative name servers, so that we can identify hosting providers in DNS zone file to count the number of domains which a hosting provider host. This tool demonstrates greater accuracy than previous methods and our testing demonstrates the ability to identify hosting service providers for most domains in real-world measurement tasks. Using this tool, we conducted measurements on the dataset combined with .com, .net and .org TLD zones. We find that the top 10 providers collectively host over 54.19% of domains while top 100 providers host over 82.99% domains, which shows a significant level of centralization in hosting service providers within the DNS. Through an analysis of NSone’s NS domains and a statistical examination of top providers’ NS domains, we find that directly identifying the base domain as the provider is inappropriate. Furthermore, we discover relationships among hosting providers and between hosting providers and infrastructure that are more complex than previously anticipated. Finally, based on our research findings, we offer corresponding suggestions to mitigate the continued development of centralization.}

	abstract = {Ensuring the security and confidentiality of cloud computing workloads is essential. To this end, major cloud providers offer computing instances based on trusted execution environments (TEEs) to support confidential computing in virtual machines. TEEs are hardware-based shielded environments building on technologies available today, such as Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP or that will soon be, as with ARM CCA.To lower the barriers to experimenting with these technologies for researchers and practitioners, we developed ConfBench, a tool for easy evaluation of confidential virtual machines. ConfBench supports both cloud-native workloads (Function-as-a-Service) and classic applications. ConfBench facilitates the management of the full lifecycle of such workloads, from their deployment to the gathering of performance metrics, taking into account the specifics of TEE-enabled confidential virtual machines. We use ConfBench to collect execution overhead measurements for different VM-enabled TEEs (Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP) through extensive experiments. We also showcase how ConfBench’s architecture allows for validating also simulation-based TEEs, reporting preliminary results with ARM CCA. We highlight the intrinsic overheads of such confidential VMs by conducting stress tests against machine learning inference tasks, DBMS and native-OS operations benchmarking, as well as by evaluating the costs of attestation operations required in the context of confidential computing. The results indicate generally tenable overheads with modern TEEs, with exceptions mainly from I/O-intensive tasks, especially with TDX. ConfBench’s multi-language support for FaaS workloads also lets us gain insights into differences stemming from varying complexities behind language runtimes. We release ConfBench to the research community and provide instructions to reproduce our experiments.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are emblematic examples of cyber-physical systems where computational components and physical processes integrate to enable autonomous navigation. UAVs rely heavily on sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) for accurate environmental awareness and control. However, the trust placed in these sensors makes UAVs vulnerable to adversarial attacks that compromise the UAV’s operational integrity. While prior work focuses on detecting attacks against specific sensors, there remains a critical gap in performing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to determine which component failed and why – especially under ambiguous or conflicting sensor reports. To address this gap, we propose SoundBoost, a novel RCA framework that leverages the UAV’s acoustic side-channel (i.e., sound) to diagnose navigation failures and attribute them to specific sensor compromises. While SoundBoost detects attacks by validating GPS and IMU sensor data, it focuses on post-incident diagnosis. SoundBoost conducts post-incident RCA by extracting robust acoustic signatures and using machine learning to cross-validate reported kinematics against physical behavior. We deploy SoundBoost on a UAV and evaluate it under real-world GPS spoofing attacks and synthesized IMU biasing attacks. SoundBoost achieves 100% true positive rate for IMU attacks and over 80% for GPS spoofing, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 21% – demonstrating its effectiveness as a practical forensic tool for sensor attack RCA.}

While hash-based MVBA protocols have been proposed to address these challenges, their higher communication overhead has raised concerns about practical performance. We present a novel MVBA protocol with adaptive security, relying exclusively on hash functions to achieve post-quantum security. Our protocol delivers near-optimal communication, constant round complexity, and significantly reduced latency compared to existing schemes, though it has sub-optimal resilience, tolerating up to 20% Byzantine corruptions instead of the typical 33%. For example, with n = 201 and input size 1.75 MB, it reduces latency by 81% over previous hash-based approaches.}

	abstract = {Voice-controlled interfaces are essential in modern smart devices, but they remain vulnerable to replay attacks that compromise voice authentication systems. Existing voice liveness detection methods often struggle to distinguish human speech from replayed audio. This paper introduces a novel approach, LiveGuard, utilizing wavelet scattering transform (WST) and Mel spectrogram scaling with a lightweight ResNet architecture to enhance voice liveness detection. WST captures robust hierarchical features, while Mel spectrogram scaling extracts fine-grained acoustic details, which the lightweight ResNet efficiently processes to identify live voice. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements of 6% with WST and Mel spectrogram scaling, achieving a top accuracy of 97.17% on POCO dataset. Meanwhile, LiveGuard demonstrates superior performance on ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof2021 benchmarks. It achieves the lowest equal error rate (EER) of 0.13%, and a min t-DCF of 0.00126 on ASVspoof2019, and an EER of 0.42% on ASVspoof2021, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance DRAM-based computing systems’ throughput, reliability, and computing capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1) they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern computing systems.We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First, EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language (C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the high-level software-defined memory system design in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically operate at significantly higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling the processor–DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior of the modeled system.We validate EasyDRAM’s evaluation accuracy by comparing the memory latency profile of a real CPU-based system and its modeled implementation using EasyDRAM. We demonstrate the ease of use of EasyDRAM by evaluating two DRAM techniques end-to-end in a real FPGA-based system: (1) in-DRAM bulk data copy (i.e., RowClone) and (2) reduced-latency DRAM access that exploits the latency variation across DRAM cells. Implementing these two techniques requires no hardware modifications and only 325 lines of C++ code over EasyDRAM’s extensible code base. We compare our results to prior FPGA-based platforms. EasyDRAM yields more accurate results (e.g., by ≈20× for execution time) than the state-of-the-art related platform. We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research, we open-source our EasyDRAM implementation at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.}

	abstract = {Unlike standard vulnerability disclosure, fixing vulnerabilities "silently" is another common approach in software development. While silent fixes can prevent potential targeted attacks without disclosing any details, they only offer short-term protection. Users often rely on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in their own software, particularly for open-source software (OSS). We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study in OSS to investigate potential security threats brought by silent fixes. By examining disclosed vulnerabilities and their corresponding patches in real-world OSSes, we investigated the prevalence of silent vulnerabilities and assessed the potential impacts they might cause. After analyzing 3,515 vulnerabilities, we observed that nearly 50% of the vulnerabilities, with half of them classified as high-severity, were exposed for over 30 days. Over 10% of them published exploits during the "silent" period, enabling adversaries to replicate the exploits and attack other OSS users. Due to delayed vulnerability disclosure, we even found one HIGH-severity vulnerability that was silently fixed still exists in downstream software, indicating that silent fixes may increase the risks for other OSSes, amplifying their impact throughout software supply chains.}

	abstract = {Effective risk management in cybersecurity requires a thorough understanding of the interplay between attacker capabilities and defense strategies. Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are a commonly used methodology for representing this interplay; however, previous work in this domain has only focused on analyzing metrics such as cost, damage, or time from the perspective of the attacker. This approach provides an incomplete view of the system, as it neglects to model defender attributes: in real-world scenarios, defenders have finite resources for countermeasures and are similarly constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that incorporates defense metrics into ADTs, and we present efficient algorithms for computing the Pareto front between defense and attack metrics. Our methods encode both attacker and defender metrics as semirings, allowing our methods to be used for many metrics such as cost, damage, and skill. We analyze tree-structured ADTs using a bottom-up approach and general ADTs by translating them into binary decision diagrams. Experiments on randomly generated ADTS demonstrate that both approaches effectively handle ADTs with several hundred nodes.}

Our main findings include (1) it is essential to collect malicious packages from various online sources because their data overlapping degrees are small; (2) despite the sheer volume of malicious packages, many reuse similar code, leading to a low diversity of malware; (3) only 28 malicious packages were repeatedly hidden via dependency libraries of 1,354 malicious packages, and dependency-hidden malware has a shorter active time; (4) security reports are the only reliable source for disclosing the malware-based context.}

By contrast, the redundancy mechanisms used in automotive double the required power and area, so cannot be practically deployed in server-space.We present ParaVerser, a high-coverage, low-overhead solution to hardware-level error detection in servers. Through minor architectural modifications, we enable conventional cores in heterogeneous server-grade processors to act as checker cores, thus exploiting heterogeneity, frequency scaling and the inherent parallelism in repeat runs to provide energy-efficient error checking. By dynamically coupling big.LITTLE-style out-of-order superscalar cores with in-order ones, we reduce energy overheads relative to a typical lockstep system by 70% with identical guarantees, at only 4.3% performance degradation, and 1064B per-core area overhead.}

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for detecting code vulnerabilities, potentially offering advantages over traditional rule-based methods. This paper proposes an enhanced framework for vulnerability detection using LLMs, incorporating various prompt engineering strategies to improve performance. We evaluate several techniques, including role-based prompting, zero-shot chain-of-thought, and structured prompting approaches, on the DiverseVul dataset of C/C++ vulnerabilities. Our experiments assess the framework’s performance across different code structures, contextual information levels, and LLM capabilities. Our results show that using our dynamic prompt engineering technique, you can improve the F1 score by up to 100% with GPT-3.5, a widely used LLM model. We also observe that GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Meta Llama 3.1 generally outperform GPT-3.5, and all models are very poor when it comes to correctly identifying the type of vulnerability in the code, with the best F1 score of 0.16 observed. However, our follow-up experiments on LLM-based vulnerability correction (i.e., patching) show a 45.77% success rate using GPT-4o, demonstrating promising results in leveraging LLMs for enhancing software security and providing insights into optimizing prompt engineering for vulnerability detection tasks.}

Thus, motivating the development of secure DNS systems, such as DNS over TLS or HTTPS. The vulnerability of these protocols against privacy attacks has led to the development of the Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS (ODoH) protocol. Nevertheless, the extent of ODoH’s effectiveness in protecting clients’ privacy is still unknown. This study investigates ODoH resiliency against website fingerprinting attacks in the open-world setting. We deploy an ODoH testbed on GENI for data collection and employ deep learning techniques such as ensemble learning for data analysis. Our findings reveal that a passive adversary can identify targeted websites using ODoH traces with an accuracy of 94%. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various factors, including clients’ locations, available resolvers, and time stability, on the attack’s success. Finally, we prototype a mitigation strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness in safeguarding clients privacy.}

	abstract = {In-network traffic control systems built on programmable data planes enhance network performance. However, these systems also increase the attack surface and are vulnerable to attacks not seen before. We focus on a problem that stems from the fact that a programmable switch data plane trusts and processes the messages from upper layers in the switch software (OS, SDK, drivers) and from neighbor nodes in the network. Since these messages can update the state maintained in the data plane, which can influence traffic control decisions, it is important to protect such messages from adversaries aiming to degrade performance, compromise privacy, bypass security, or, worst case, network outage.In this paper, we present P4Auth, a key-based protection mechanism that ensures the authenticity and integrity of such messages in in-network systems making fast traffic control decisions. Our key idea is to move key-based security primitives to the switch data plane so that it reduces the trusted computing base and exposure to switch software vulnerabilities while enabling faster checks in the data plane. To realize this idea, we design and develop an authentication protocol, secure key exchange mechanism, and associated data plane primitives. We prototype P4Auth for Intel Tofino and understand the overheads of P4Auth. We also demonstrate how P4Auth protects two in-network systems from man-in-the-middle (MitM) adversaries.}

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been the de facto in-vehicle network protocol since the 1980s, despite lacking essential security principles like authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CAN is especially vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, threatening the availability of safety-critical functions. Existing countermeasures have seen limited adoption due to challenges in real-time detection, prevention, and high overhead on Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To address these issues, we propose MichiCAN, a distributed, backward-compatible, real-time defense against DoS and spoofing attacks. MichiCAN leverages integrated/on-chip CAN controllers in modern MCUs, enabling bit-level access to CAN messages. This allows MichiCAN to detect DoS attacks during the arbitration phase and neutralize them by bussing off the attacker ECU swiftly. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real vehicle demonstrate MichiCAN’s effectiveness in enhancing automotive network security.}

	abstract = {Application Fingerprinting (AF) enables the identification of applications via traffic analysis, aiding network administrators in comprehending user behavior. However, a large volume of unknown traffic in real network environments poses significant challenges for AF methods in both differentiating unknown traffic and characterizing unknown apps. To address these challenges, we introduce a Semi-Supervised App Fingerprinting (SemiAF) deep learning framework. Specifically, to tackle the unknown traffic differentiating challenge, a semi-supervised contrastive learning method is employed to differentiate and cluster unknown applications. To characterize the features of unknown apps, we present a novel In-Flow Burst Interaction (IFBI) graph where each node represents a fine-grained action. By decomposing the unknown app traffic into combinations of these fine-grained actions, a deeper understanding of the network patterns can be achieved. Furthermore, we introduce an explainable neural network framework, revealing the network traffic interactions and inherent relationships. Extensive experimental results in three scenarios demonstrate that SemiAF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unknown application recognition.}

	abstract = {As encrypted malware campaigns become more sophisticated, significant challenges arise in effectively detecting malicious communications when relying solely on single-stream or single-feature network traffic analysis methods. Therefore, we propose MalTAG, a graph-based flow interaction mining framework to address existing challenges. MalTAG integrates network traffic into a multi-flow correlated graph and incorpo-rates various feature types rather than relying on a single stream or single type of feature. It effectively captures the contextual correlation properties of malicious activities in both temporal and attribute dimensions. Furthermore, MalTAG achieves graph representation learning through self-supervised contrastive learning without relying on prior label knowledge. This design helps to construct more stable representations of traffic behavior to adapt to the evolving nature of malicious activities. Ultimately, it utilizes various machine learning algorithms to detect malicious traffic comprehensively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility and good performance of MalTAG in malware detection and family classification, outperforming existing methods.}

	abstract = {A popular approach to detect cyberattacks is to monitor systems in real-time to identify malicious activities as they occur. While these solutions aim to detect threats early, minimizing damage, they suffer from a significant challenge due to the presence of false positives. False positives have a detrimental impact on computer systems, which can lead to interruptions of legitimate operations and reduced productivity. Most contemporary works tend to use advanced Machine Learning and AI solutions to address this challenge. Unfortunately, false positives can, at best, be reduced but not eliminated.In this paper, we propose an alternate approach that focuses on reducing the impact of false positives rather than eliminating them. We introduce Valkyrie, a framework that can enhance any existing runtime detector with a post-detection response. Valkyrie is designed for time-progressive attacks, such as micro-architectural attacks, rowhammer, ransomware, and cryptominers, that achieve their objectives incrementally using system resources. As soon as an attack is detected, Valkyrie limits the allocated computing resources, throttling the attack, until the detector’s confidence is sufficiently high to warrant a more decisive action. For a false positive, limiting the system resources only results in a small increase in execution time. On average, the slowdown incurred due to false positives is less than 1% for single-threaded programs and 6.7% for multi-threaded programs. On the other hand, attacks like rowhammer are prevented, while the potency of micro-architectural attacks, ransomware, and cryptominers is greatly reduced.}

However, its extensive and feature-rich API interface exposes a broad attack surface, making K8s vulnerable to exploits of software vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Even if K8s adopts role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to K8s APIs, this approach lacks the granularity needed to protect specification attributes within API requests. This paper proposes a novel solution, KubeFence, which implements finer-grain API filtering tailored to specific client workloads. KubeFence analyzes Kubernetes Operators from trusted repositories and leverages their configuration files to restrict unnecessary features of the K8s API, to mitigate misconfigurations and vulnerabilities exploitable through the K8s API. The experimental results show that KubeFence can significantly reduce the attack surface and prevent attacks compared to RBAC.}

	abstract = {Neuromorphic architectures that implement spiking neural networks provide a biologically inspired and energy-efficient approach to processing information. These systems use spike trains, where the timing and frequency of spikes drive computation, offering unique advantages in dynamic and event-driven tasks. This paper develops a concurrent testing methodology for neuromorphic architectures, emphasizing Error Detection and Isolation (EDI) through a hierarchical model-based redundancy framework. Our approach uses a software-based monitoring system that compares the discrepancies between the observed and predicted behavior of hardware-mapped neurons at both the system and the neuron levels. We identify key statistical properties of spike trains that are critical for error detection and develop computationally efficient machine learning models to forecast these properties. By combining real-time observations with predictions of neuron behavior, our EDI methodology ensures robust fault detection and isolation. Experimental evaluations using an open source neuromorphic processor design executing benchmark datasets, MNIST, FashionMNIST, and SVHN, demonstrate the effectiveness. We observe high fault coverage with reduced computational overhead, making the EDI scheme suitable for real-time use in neuromorphic systems.}

However, as IP addresses and ports no longer identify QUIC connections but use Connection Identifiers (CIDs), load balancing becomes challenging. In this work, we introduce two novel attacks for revealing the server count behind QUIC-aware load balancers and breaking the unlinkability guarantees that prevent tracking of structured CIDs. We conducted tests on real-world deployments to assess the feasibility of existing and novel attacks. Our results indicate that our attack is more effective in estimating the number of servers behind load balancers than existing work. Furthermore, the data of our second novel attack suggests that almost all observed load balancers are vulnerable, allowing user tracking across networks. This work also introduces novel countermeasures to mitigate these attacks while being faster than existing approaches for enabling secure load balancing.}

	abstract = {Physical attacks such as sensor spoofing and tampering are a growing concern for Robotic Autonomous Vehicles (RAV) such as drones and rovers. Studying the impact of these attacks and developing defense techniques is challenging, as it requires sophisticated signal injection hardware. Consequently, prior work in RAV security simulates physical attacks through software by injecting bias into sensors. However, the absence of a standardized method for attack injection compels researchers to use custom approaches. This lack of uniformity leads to challenges in reproducibility and, at times, questionable claims.We present RAVAGE a tool for injecting realistic physical attacks through software. RAVAGE is easily extensible to multiple autopilot software and RAV types. It also allows users to configure the attack parameters without any code modifications. Further, RAVAGE automates the injection of both overt and stealthy attacks, offering a comprehensive setup for RAV security experiments. We evaluate RAVAGE on three virtual and three real RAVs, targeting six different types of RAV sensors, across a wide range of missions. We find that the attacks injected by RAVAGE resulted in crashes or mission failure in over 75% of the cases while incurring less than 2% performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Ensuring the security of AI models is becoming increasingly important as AI systems are integrated into various products and services. In the future, many AI models may undergo security evaluations at testing centers to obtain certifications that validate their security and reliability. However, due to concerns about trade secrets, companies may only provide black-box access to their models during testing. This necessitates the development of black-box model-level backdoor detection methods, since evaluation is limited to the model itself, without access to its internal structure or training data.In this work, we propose BProm, a novel black-box model-level backdoor detection method based on visual prompting (VP). VP is a technique that adapts well-trained frozen models for source domain tasks to target domain tasks by mapping class subspaces between the source and target domains. We identify a critical misalignment, termed class subspace inconsistency, between clean and poisoned datasets. Using this insight, BProm detects backdoors by observing the low classification accuracy of prompted models when backdoors are present. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BProm in identifying backdoored models under black-box settings, paving the way for secure and reliable certification of AI models.}

	abstract = {Constant-time programming is a principal line of defense against timing side-channel attacks. It involves hardening software in such a manner that execution time is uncorrelated to sensitive data values, and is now broadly employed in most cryptography and other security critical kernels. However, constant-time programming relies on necessary assumptions about the underlying microarchitectural implementation, which are frequently incorrect or incomplete, leading to exploits. Consequently, devising methodologies for joint leakage detection in high assurance applications, compiler optimizations and microarchitectural implementations is an increasingly important problem. This paper presents MicroSampler, a dynamic leakage detection framework to identify secret-dependent microarchitectural behavior that can lead to side-channel leakage in security critical software. MicroSampler runs the constant-time code to be verified on a cycle-accurate register-transfer level (RTL) simulation of the target system and builds a comprehensive and detailed representation of microarchitectural state captured at cycle granularity. MicroSampler then uses statistical analysis to measure any existing association between microarchitectural state and data values that are identified as sensitive (e.g. encryption keys). We demonstrate the utility of the proposed leakage detection framework through multiple case studies. We show MicroSampler is able to reveal vulnerabilities in constant-time encryption code in diverse cases where the vulnerabilities originate in the algorithm design, compiler optimizations or microarchitectural implementation.}

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 73 real-world reentrancy attacks on EVM-compatible blockchains from 2016 to 2024, investigating the factors contributing to their continued prevalence. Through integrated qualitative and quantitative analyses, we identify key trends in exploited vulnerabilities, track the evolution of attacker techniques, and expose a widening gap between academic research and real-world practice. Our findings reveal that reentrancy attacks are more diverse and sophisticated than previously understood, frequently involving complex interactions across multiple contracts, projects, and even blockchains. Critically, we highlight how attackers are adapting to bypass traditional detection and defense techniques. This research provides crucial insights into the evolving threat landscape, challenges outdated assumptions, and offers practical guidelines for developing more robust and effective reentrancy defenses.}

The results are based on data extracted from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We analyzed 159 CVEs and explored the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) information associated with them. Our results showed that the security vulnerabilities were distributed unevenly across the 23 vulnerability classes, with the top six most common classes accounting for 74% to 89% of all vulnerabilities in each category of IoT devices. EV Chargers had the highest mean and median CVSS severity score, followed by Other Traffic Devices and EVs. Non-EVs had the lowest CVSS, which were statistically significantly different than the other categories of transportation IoT devices.

Indeed, users’ network traffic data contain sensitive information, such as browsing history, that can be maliciously exploited, e.g., sold to entities or for blackmailing.In this paper, we explore the problem of providing a secure and efficient way to grant full network data access to a mobile application willing to perform NTA while preventing misuse of the latter data. We consider the network data to be misused if the latter is sent or leaked out of control of the mobile device, e.g., to an external server. To this aim, we design SANeM, an on-device kernel-level solution. It takes the form of permission that provides a means for an application to perform NTA without being able to misuse the user’s network data.We implement a corresponding prototype atop Android 14. Our evaluation on a rooted Samsung S20 shows that SANeM incurs a small overhead on NTA applications that load it and the overall system resources. Furthermore, compared to other workaround mechanisms, such as on-device local/fake VPNs, the overhead with SANeM is considerably lower.}

The framework includes: i) a container runtime for ZICs; ii) an image manager that automates the creation and seamlessly downloads ZIC images; iii) a tool to build replicable environments based on partitioning hypervisors. The container runtime allows integrating software components with strict real-time and dependability requirements into orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), fostering novel industrial use cases. The building tool and image manager facilitate ZICs development and testing through replicable environments and transparent image management. Experimental results show that ZICs survive a management VM crash and can guarantee timeliness despite heavy co-located stresses.}

	abstract = {In modern blockchains, efficient, fair, and fault-tolerant information dissemination is critical for performance and security. Several stages of the transaction lifecycle are affected, from the creation and dissemination of transactions to the dissemination of blocks in the consensus layer. Mempool protocols, such as LØ, already address some of modern blockchains’ security threats. However, others remain unless fairness is embedded most fundamentally in the dissemination layer used by these protocols to share transactions and blocks and to reconcile mempools. This paper introduces HERMES, a novel dissemination protocol for mempools that leverages robust minimal structures to optimize data propagation, balance load, and ensure fairness despite faults and Byzantine actors. Specifically, we address front-running attacks by randomizing the choice of an overlay structure while forcing nodes to prove adherence to the mempools’ dissemination policies and the random choice made. Experimental results show significant performance improvements compared to traditional broadcast protocols for both permissioned and permissionless blockchains.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of sophisticated evasion techniques employed by phishing attacks in circumventing anti-phishing and email security measures is on the rise. The present study offers an exhaustive analysis of user-reported phishing messages pertaining to five companies over a ten-month period. These messages are of particular interest as they evaded all state of the art security layers in place and were identified by the recipients themselves.To study these elusive phishing attempts, we developed an analysis infrastructure, CrawlerBox, designed to overcome cloaking tactics that exploit browser fingerprinting and bot detection challenges. CrawlerBox is made available as an open-source tool to assist other researchers in pursuing further studies.Over the course of ten months, we gathered 1,551 user-reported messages that were confirmed to be malicious, with a particular focus on those targeting the harvesting of corporate credentials. Our analysis infrastructure enabled us to scan these messages and crawl any associated web resources, including URLs, embedded HTML, and JavaScript content.Our findings indicate that the majority of observed phishing attacks are low-volume but meticulously planned, exhibiting a high degree of premeditation and strategic preparation. In particular, a substantial number of sites were registered and had obtained TLS certificates several weeks before the attacks in order to avoid being flagged based on their young age, a common practice used by products to defeat phishing websites. Furthermore, it was observed that phishing pages are now safeguarded by advanced evasion mechanisms, such as bot detection services and open-source fingerprinting libraries. Notably, QR codes are increasingly used to embed phishing content. The victim needs to use a personal phone to flash the code and access the site; this activity will typically fall outside the perimeter of the corporate security defenses. These findings underscore the evolving sophistication of phishing threats and the urgent need for resilient systems to counter these advanced techniques, further emphasizing the critical role of robust infrastructures like CrawlerBox in enhancing the security and dependability of email systems.}

	abstract = {This paper describes an attempt to automate threat hunting, taking cyber threat intelligence messages as input and generating queries to search logs for attack evidence using a popular query language, Kibana, used in Security Operations Centers (SOC). Our prototype implementation, AIThreatTrack, uses GPT-4 to extract actionable threat intelligence from real-time messages like X and Slack. The core idea is to explain the extracted intelligence in terms of MITRE ATT&CK TTPs using a knowledge graph containing "is-a" and "part-of" relationships (extracted using GPT-4) with the following benefits:(a) Significantly reduced hallucinations from 47% (GPT-4) to 1.5% using two orthogonal ways to cross-check answers. (b) Gaining analysts’ trust with explained results. (c) Using chain-of-knowledge prompting to significantly improve query generation accuracy. This approach supports expanding the scope of the knowledge graph to further improve query generation. Our approach significantly outperforms the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and chain-of-thought reasoning LLM in reducing hallucinations.}

	abstract = {The increasing use of smart home technologies has raised concerns about security vulnerabilities, particularly in Z-Wave systems. Existing approaches hold the promise of assessing Z-Wave security in slave devices but fall short of being effectively applied to discover vulnerabilities in Z-Wave controllers, which are central to Z-Wave systems. We present ZCover, a framework for systematically analyzing the application layer of Z-Wave controllers to uncover security vulnerabilities. By extracting the known and unknown properties of the Z-Wave controller and utilizing mutation that considers the correlations of the Z-Wave packet frame fields, ZCover can effectively discover unknown vulnerabilities in the target Z-Wave controller. Evaluation on nine real-world Z-Wave devices showed that ZCover outperformed existing Z-Wave security research, by discovering 15 previously unknown critical vulnerabilities with 12 new CVE IDs assigned. ZCover can be utilized as a resource for ensuring the security of Z-Wave controllers in building a secure Z-Wave smart home.}

	abstract = {Safety-critical domains, such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles, employ machine learning (ML), where mis-predictions can cause severe repercussions. Training datasets may contain faults, thereby compromising ML accuracy. Ensembles, where multiple ML models vote on predictions, are effective at maintaining predictive capability, and thus resilient against faulty training data because individual models focus on diverse input features. Nevertheless, ensemble diversity varies per input. Hence, weighted ensembles can bolster resilience by assigning unique weights to constituent models. While existing weighted ensembles focus on output-space diversity, we propose leveraging their feature-space diversity to better capture model independence and achieve greater resilience. Therefore, we present ReMlX, which applies explainable artificial intelligence to extract the feature-space diversity of ensemble models, and adjusts their weights to maximize resilience. Compared to its most competitive baseline, ReMlX is 12% more resilient but 15% slower than dynamic weighted ensembles based on stacking.}

Traditional recovery mechanisms often focus narrowly on sensor or control system disruptions, neglecting the interconnected vulnerabilities, particularly at the actuator level. To address these gaps, we propose SHIELD: Side-channel analysis-based multimodal Holistic Intrusion Evaluation with Layered Defense. It is a comprehensive security framework that leverages side-channel data for robust detection, precise attack categorization, and tailored recovery processes across the entire UAV system. Side channels provide critical, hard-to-manipulate information that enhances the detection of sophisticated, stealthy attacks. By categorizing the specific nature of an attack, SHIELD selects the most appropriate recovery strategy, focusing on the integrity of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals to ensure effective recovery and mission continuity. This makes SHIELD a holistic approach across the sensor-control-actuation spectrum.}

However, the correctness and, therefore, the safety of these systems can be compromised by out-of-distribution data, accidental faults, and security breaches. This paper investigates using a replicated ML architecture to mitigate the risks associated with complex single-points-of-failure. Additionally, it explores the application of rejuvenation to sustain healthy majorities when facing persistent threats. We evaluate the output reliability of the proposed architecture in two case studies: traffic sign detection and perception for autonomous driving. We adopt models and reliability functions, validating our findings using realistic data sets and fault injection experiments. We also evaluate driving safety using the proposed architecture in the CARLA simulator. Our results show that our models can present a good generalization and multi-version ML with proactive rejuvenation can improve correctness and, thus, safety despite faults and cyberattacks.}

	abstract = {Today’s security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate RuleLLM’s effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are promising—RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a precision of 85.2% and a recall of 91.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.}
