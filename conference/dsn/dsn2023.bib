	abstract = {Modern smart home control systems utilize realtime occupancy and activity monitoring to ensure control efficiency, occupants' comfort, and optimal energy consumption. Moreover, adopting machine learning-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) enhances security and reliability. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although ADMs limit attack scopes, the availability of information like occupants' location, conducted activities, and alteration capability of smart appliances increase the attack surface. Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems is crucial to design robust defense solutions. However, state-of-the-art analyzers do not consider contemporary control and defense solutions and generate trivial attack vectors. To address this, we propose a control and defense-aware novel attack analysis framework for a modern smart home control system, efficiently extracting ADM rules. We verify and validate our framework using a state-of-the-art dataset and a prototype testbed.}

	abstract = {The security goals of cloud providers and users include memory confidentiality and integrity, which requires implementing replay attack protection (RAP). RAP can be achieved using integrity trees or mutually authenticated channels. Integrity trees incur significant performance overheads and are impractical for protecting large memories. Mutually authenticated channels have been proposed only for packetized memory interfaces that address only a very small niche domain, require fundamental changes to memory system architecture, and assume fully-trusted modules. We propose SecDDR, a low-cost RAP that targets direct-attached memories, like DDRx. SecDDR avoids memory-side data authentication, and thus, only adds a small amount of logic to memory components and does not change the underlying DDR protocol, making it practical for widespread adoption. In contrast to prior mutual authentication proposals, which require trusting the entire memory module, SecDDR targets untrusted modules by placing its limited security logic on the DRAM die (or package) of the ECC chip. Our evaluation shows that SecDDR performs within 1% of an encryption-only memory without RAP and that SecDDR provides 18.8% and 7.8% average performance improvements (up to 190.4% and 24.8%) relative to a 64-ary integrity tree and an authenticated channel, respectively.}

	abstract = {Witnessing the blooming adoption of push notifications on mobile devices, this new message delivery paradigm has become pervasive in diverse applications. Accompanying with its broad adoption, the potential security risks and privacy exposure issues raise public concerns regarding its great social impacts. This paper conducts the first attempt to exploit the mobile notification ecosystem. By dissecting its structural elements and implementation process, a comprehensive vulnerability analysis is conducted towards the complete flow of mobile notification from platform enrollment to messaging. Meanwhile, for privacy exposure, we first examine the implementation of privacy policy compliance by proposing a three-level inspection approach to guide our analysis. Then, our top-down methods from documentation analysis, application network traffic study, to static analysis expose the illicit data collection behaviors in released applications. In addition, we uncover the potential privacy inference resulted from the notification monitoring. To support our analysis, we conduct empirical studies on 12 most popular notification platforms and perform static analysis over 30,000+ applications. We discover: 1) six platforms either provide ambiguous KEY naming rules or offer vulnerable messaging APIs; 2) privacy policy compliance implementations are either stagnated at the documentation stages (8 of 12 platforms) or never implemented in apps, resulting in billions of users suffering from privacy exposure; and 3) some apps can stealthily monitor notification messages delivering to other apps, potentially incurring user privacy inference risks. Our study raises the urgent demand for better regulations of mobile notification deployment.}

	abstract = {Geographic routing for connected vehicles enables vehicles and roadside infrastructure to exchange information about traffic conditions and road hazards based on their geographic positions. Its security is thus critical to traffic efficiency and road safety. In this paper, we conduct a security analysis of one standardized geographic routing protocol - GeoNetworking-and unfortunately find that its packet forwarding algorithms are vulnerable to two simple attacks. The first inter-area interception attack disturbs the victim vehicle's routing decision making and intercepts packets transmitted from one area to another. The second intra-area blockage attack intervenes packet forwarding within an area by impersonating a packet forwarder in a contention based flooding process; The attacker injects fake packets to its nearby peers and prevents vehicles within an area from receiving the broadcast packets. We use an open-source simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of proof-of-concept attacks and assess their attack damages under the settings released in public field tests. The first attack achieves an inter-area interception rate up to 99.9% (>35% in all test cases); The second attack reaches an intra-area packet blockage rate between 35% and 39%, which implies that about one-third vehicles within an area fail to receive broadcast packets. These attacks cause unnecessary traffic jams and collisions which could be avoided if GeoNetworking is properly secured. We further propose standard-compatible solutions to mitigating both attacks and conduct a preliminary evaluation to validate their effectiveness.}

	abstract = {To achieve strict reliability goals with lower redundancy cost, Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) enables run-time recovery for future in-vehicle networks. While the recovery mechanisms rely on network planning to establish reliability guarantees, existing network planning solutions are not suitable for TSSDN due to its domain-specific scheduling and reliability concerns. The sparse solution space and expensive reliability verification further complicate the problem. We propose NPTSN, a TSSDN planning solution based on deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). It represents the domain-specific concerns with the RL environment and constructs solutions with an intelligent network generator. The network generator iteratively proposes TSSDN solutions based on a failure analysis and trains a decision-making neural network using a modified actor-critic algorithm. Extensive performance evaluations show that NPTSN guarantees reliability for more test cases and shortens the decision trajectory compared to state-of-the-art solutions. It reduces the network cost by up to 6.8x in the performed experiments.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of robotic aerial vehicles (RAVs) has attracted extensive interest in numerous public and civilian applications, from flying drones to quadrotors. Security of RAV systems is posting greater challenges as RAV controller software becomes more complex and exposes a growing attack surface. Memory isolation techniques, which virtually separate the memory space and conduct hardware-based memory access control, are believed to prevent the attacker from compromising the entire system by exploiting one memory vulnerability. In this paper, we propose Ares, a new variable-level vulnerability assessment framework to explore deeper bugs from a combined cyber-physical perspective. We present a data-driven method to illustrate that, despite state-of-the-art memory isolation efforts, RAV systems are still vulnerable to physics-aware data manipulation attacks. We augment RAV control states with intermediate state variables by tracing accessible control parameters and vehicle dynamics within the same isolated memory region. With this expanded state variable space, we apply multivariate statistical analysis to investigate inter-variable quantitative data dependencies and search for vulnerable state variables. Ares utilizes a reinforcement learning-based method to show how an attacker can exploit memory bugs and parameter defects in a legitimate memory view and elaborately craft adversarial variable values to disrupt a RAV's safe operations. We demonstrate the feasibility and capability of Ares on the widely-used ArduPilot RAV framework. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the attacker can leverage these vulnerable state variables to achieve various RAV failures during real-time operation, and even evade existing defense solutions.}

	abstract = {The detection of memory errors is common practice in safety-critical software, for example in the automotive and avionics industry. International safety standards recommend using checksums for protecting critical data in computer memories. Typical implementations verify the checksum before data access and recompute it after modification using the same algorithm. However, we show that this approach can sometimes dramatically worsen the reliability of computer systems with regard to transient memory faults, and also permanent faults remain undetected. A solution with significant conceptual advantages is constituted by differential checksum algorithms, which update the respective checksum without full recomputation on data modification. We present a compiler-based solution that inserts differential checksums into C/C++ data structures automatically to cope with their increased complexity. An extensive fault-injection campaign with the TACLeBench benchmark collection shows that differential checksums reduce silent data corruptions by 95% on average whereas non-differential checksums turn out to be mostly ineffective because they introduce a window of vulnerability.}

	abstract = {Page tables enforce process isolation in systems. Rowhammer attacks break process isolation by flipping bits in DRAM to tamper page tables and achieving privilege escalation. Moreover, new Rowhammer attacks break existing mitigations. We seek to protect systems against such breakthrough attacks. We present PT-Guard, an integrity protection mechanism for page tables. PT-Guard uses unused bits in Page Table Entries (PTE) to embed a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for the PTE cacheline without any storage overhead. These unused bits arise from PTEs supporting petabytes of physical memory while systems targeted by Rowhammer use at-most terabytes of mem-ory. By storing and verifying MACs for PTEs, PT-Guard detects arbitrary bit-flips in PTEs. Moreover, PT-Guard also provides best-effort correction of faulty-PTEs leveraging value locality. PT-Guard protects page tables from breakthrough Rowhammer attacks with negligible hardware changes, no DRAM storage, <72 bytes of SRAM, 1.3% slowdown, and no software changes.}

	abstract = {State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial manipulation and backdoor attacks. Backdoored models deviate from expected behavior on inputs with predefined triggers while retaining performance on clean data. Recent works focus on software simulation of backdoor injection during the inference phase by modifying network weights, which we find often unrealistic in practice due to restrictions in hardware. In contrast, in this work for the first time, we present an end-to-end backdoor injection attack realized on actual hardware on a classifier model using Rowhammer as the fault injection method. To this end, we first investigate the viability of backdoor injection attacks in real-life deployments of DNNs on hardware and address such practical issues in hardware implementation from a novel optimization perspective. We are motivated by the fact that vulnerable memory locations are very rare, device-specific, and sparsely distributed. Consequently, we propose a novel network training algorithm based on constrained optimization to achieve a realistic backdoor injection attack in hardware. By modifying parameters uniformly across the convolutional and fully-connected layers as well as optimizing the trigger pattern together, we achieve state-of-the-art attack performance with fewer bit flips. For instance, our method on a hardware-deployed ResNet-20 model trained on CIFAR-10 achieves over 89% test accuracy and 92% attack success rate by flipping only 10 out of 2.2 million bits.}

	abstract = {State-machine replication protocols represent the foundation of many fault-tolerant services. Unfortunately, their inherent complexity makes existing implementations notoriously difficult to debug and test. To address this problem, we propose a novel design approach, micro replication, whose main goal is to reduce bugs and enable replication protocols with improved debuggability properties. At its core, our concept consists of a set of principles that, if followed during protocol design, later significantly facilitate crucial tasks such as bug-source isolation, state-information retrieval, as well as root-cause identification. To achieve this, micro replication organizes a protocol as a composition of specialized modules (“micro replicas”) that each encapsulate a particular protocol phase or mechanism, and therefore are easier to test and monitor than traditional monolithic replicas. Besides discussing the underlying ideas of our approach, to show its feasibility we also present and evaluate Mirador, the first micro-replicated Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol.}

Heron achieves scalability through partitioning (sharding) and microsecond latency through a careful design that leverages one-sided RDMA primitives. Heron significantly improves the throughput and latency of applications when compared to message passing-based replicated systems. But it really shines when executing multi-partition requests, where objects in multiple partitions are accessed in a request, the Achilles heel of most partitioned systems. We implemented Heron and evaluated its performance extensively. Our experiments show that Heron reduces the latency of coordinating linearizable executions to the level of microseconds and improves the performance of executing complex workloads by one order of magnitude in comparison to state-of-the-art S-SMR systems.}

	abstract = {With the increasing demand for communication between blockchains, improving the performance of cross-chain communication protocols becomes an emerging challenge. We take a first step towards analyzing the limitations of cross-chain communication protocols by comprehensively evaluating Cosmos Network's Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol. To achieve our goal we introduce a novel framework to guide empirical evaluations of cross-chain communication protocols. We implement an instance of our framework as a tool to evaluate the IBC protocol. Our findings highlight several challenges, such as high transaction confirmation latency, bottlenecks in the blockchain's RPC implementation and concurrency issues that hinder the scalability of the cross-chain message relayer. We also demonstrate how to reduce the time required to complete cross-chain transfers by up to 70% when submitting large amounts of transfers. Finally, we discuss challenges faced during deployment with the objective of contributing to the development and advancement of cross-chain communication.}

	abstract = {The API call sequence based malware detectors have proven to be promising, especially when incorporated with deep neural networks (DNNs). Several adversarial attack methods are proposed to fool these detectors by introducing undetectable perturbations into normal samples. However, in real-world scenarios, the malware detector provides only the predicted label for a given sample, without exposing its network architecture or output probability, making it challenging for adversarial attacks under the decision-based black-box. Existing work in this area typically relies on random-based methods that suffer high costs and low attack success rates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decision-based black-box attack against API sequence based malware detectors, called MalAder. Our approach aims to improve the attack success rate as well as query efficiency through a directional perturbation algorithm. First, it utilizes attention-based API ranking to assess the importance of API calls in the context of different API sequences. This assessment guides the insertion position for perturbation. Then, the perturbation is carried out using benign distance perturbing, which gradually shortens the semantic distance from adversarial API sequences to a set of benign samples. Finally, our algorithm iteratively generates adversarial malware samples by performing perturbations. In addition, we have implemented MalAder and evaluated its performance against two classic malware detectors. The results show that MalAder outperforms state-of-the-art decision-based black-box adversarial attacks, proving its effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Java is one of the preferred options of modern developers and has become increasingly more prominent with the prevalence of the open-source culture. Thanks to the serialization and deserialization features, Java programs have the flexibility to transmit object data between multiple components or systems, which significantly facilitates development. However, the features may also allow the attackers to construct gadget chains and lead to Java deserialization vulnerabilities. Due to the highly flexible and customizable nature of Java deserialization, finding an exploitable gadget chain is complicated and usually costs researchers a great deal of effort to confirm the vulnerability. To break such a dilemma, in this paper, we introduced Tabby, a highly accurate framework that leverages the Soot framework and Neo4j graph database for finding Java deserialization gadget chains. We leveraged Tabby to analyze 248 Jar files, found 80 practical gadget chains, and received 7 CVE-IDs from Xstream and Apache Dubbo. They both improved the security design to deal with potential security risks.}

A long-standing challenge in using these inconsistent labels is extracting class-determined tags. In this paper, we present Tagclass,a tool based on incremental parsing to associate tags with their corresponding family, behavior, and platform classes. Tagclasstreats behavior and platform tags as locators and achieves incremental parsing by introducing and iterating the following two algorithms: 1) location first search, which hits family tags using locators, and 2) co-occurrence first search, which finds new locators by family tags. Experiments across two benchmark datasets indicate Tagclassoutperforms existing methods, improving the parsing accuracy by 21% and 28%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, Tagclassis the first tag class-determined malware label parsing tool, which would pave the way for research on crowdsourcing malware annotation.

	abstract = {As cloud workloads increasingly adopt the fault-tolerant Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model, demand for improved performance has increased. Alas, the performance of FaaS applications is heavily bottlenecked by the remote object store in which FaaS objects are maintained. We identify that the upcoming CXL-based cache-coherent disaggregated memory is a promising technology for maintaining FaaS objects. Our analysis indicates that CXL's low-latency, high-bandwidth access characteristics coupled with compute-side caching of objects, provides significant performance potential over an in-memory RDMA-based object store. We observe however that CXL lacks the requisite level of fault-tolerance necessary to operate at an inter-server scale within the datacenter. Furthermore, its cache-line granular accesses impose inefficiencies for object-granular data store accesses. We propose Āpta, a CXL-based object-granular memory interface for maintaining FaaS objects. Āpta's key innovation is a novel fault-tolerant coherence protocol for keeping the cached objects consistent without compromising availability in the face of compute server failures. Our evaluation of Āpta using 6 full FaaS application workflows (totaling 26 functions) indicates that it outperforms a state-of-the-art fault-tolerant object caching protocol on an RDMA-based system by 21-90% and an uncached CXL-based system by 15-42%.}

	abstract = {In large-scale datacenters, memory failure is one of the leading causes of server crashes, and uncorrectable error (UCE) is the major fault type indicating defects of memory modules. Existing approaches tend to predict UCEs using Correctable Errors (CE). However, bit-level CE information has not been completely discussed in previous works and CEs with error bit patterns are strongly correlated with UCE occurrences. In this paper, we present a novel Hierarchical Intelligent Memory Failure Prediction (HiMFP) framework which can predict UCEs on multiple levels of the memory system and associate with memory recovery techniques. Particularly, we leverage CE addresses on multiple levels of memory, especially bit-level, and construct machine learning models based on spatial and temporal CE information. Results of algorithm evaluation using real-world datasets indicate that HiMFP significantly enhances the prediction performance compared with the baseline algorithm. Overall, Virtual Machines (VM) interruptions caused by UCEs can be reduced by around 45% using HiMFP.}

	abstract = {Intel's software guard extensions (SGX) provide hardware enclaves to guarantee confidentiality and integrity for sensitive code and data. However, systems leveraging such security mechanisms must often pay high performance overheads. A major source of this overhead is SGX enclave transitions which induce expensive cross-enclave context switches. The Intel SGX SDK mitigates this with a switchless call mechanism for transitionless cross-enclave calls using worker threads. Intel's SGX switchless call implementation improves performance but provides limited flexibility: developers need to statically fix the system configuration at build time, which is error-prone and misconfigurations lead to performance degradations and waste of CPU resources. ZC-Switchless is a configless and efficient technique to drive the execution of SGX switchless calls. Its dynamic approach optimises the total switchless worker threads at runtime to minimise CPU waste. The experimental evaluation shows that ZC-Switchless obviates the performance penalty of misconfigured switchless systems while minimising CPU waste.}

	abstract = {The recent advancements in machine learning have led to a wave of interest in adopting online learning approaches for long-standing attack mitigation issues. In particular, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to network service availability. These attacks have been well investigated under the assumption that malicious traffic originates from a single attack profile. Based on this premise, malicious traffic characteristics are assumed to be considerably different from legitimate traffic. In this paper, we introduce a poisoning attack that takes a contextual generative approach to generate shifting malicious traffic, studying its effects on online deep-learning DDoS filters. We investigate an adverse scenario where the attacker is “crafty”, switching profiles during attacks and generating erratic attack traffic. This elusive attacker manipulates contexts derived using stochastic modeling that capture the distributions of network traffic to poison the filters. To this end, we present a generative model MimicShift, capable of efficiently shifting its attack while retaining the originating traffic's intrinsic properties. Comprehensive experiments show that online learning filters are highly susceptible to poisoning attacks, sometimes faltering to 100% false-negative rates on the evaluation datasets.}

The integrated threat intelligence feeds at these resolvers enable easy identification and blocking of malicious exploits that use DNS queries. However, we observe that the shared local caches at these public DNS resolvers enable covert communication channels from otherwise secure enterprises accessible to any remote adversary, thus cautioning the migration to public DNS resolvers. We present YODA, a covert communication channel via public DNS resolvers that can exfiltrate sensitive information from a victim enterprise to a remote adversary. Unlike prior works, YODA overloads DNS queries for popular domains to transfer the data without revealing any identity of the adversary. Consequently, YODA cannot be blocked by domain name filtering. We demonstrate our attack on public DNS resolvers such as Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS, and LibreDNS. Our evaluations show that the adversary can achieve a bandwidth of 480bps with desktop devices.}

	abstract = {Attacks on Federated Learning (FL) can severely reduce the quality of the generated models and limit the usefulness of this emerging learning paradigm that enables on-premise decentralized learning. However, existing untargeted attacks are not practical for many scenarios as they assume that i) the attacker knows every update of benign clients, or ii) the attacker has a large dataset to locally train updates imitating benign parties. In this paper, we propose a data-free untargeted attack (DFA) that synthesizes malicious data to craft adversarial models without eavesdropping on the transmission of benign clients at all or requiring a large quantity of task-specific training data. We design two variants of DFA, namely DFA-R and DFA-G, which differ in how they trade off stealthiness and effectiveness. Specifically, DFA-R iteratively optimizes a malicious data layer to minimize the prediction confidence of all outputs of the global model, whereas DFA-G interactively trains a malicious data generator network by steering the output of the global model toward a particular class. Experimental results on Fashion-MNIST, Cifar-10, and SVHN show that DFA, despite requiring fewer assumptions than existing attacks, achieves similar or even higher attack success rate than state-of-the-art untargeted attacks against various state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Concretely, they can evade all considered defense mechanisms in at least 50% of the cases for CIFAR-10 and often reduce the accuracy by more than a factor of 2. Consequently, we design REFD, a defense specifically crafted to protect against data-free attacks. REFD leverages a reference dataset to detect updates that are biased or have a low confidence. It greatly improves upon existing defenses by filtering out the malicious updates and achieves high global model accuracy.}

	abstract = {Membership inference (MI) attacks are more diverse in a Federated Learning (FL) setting, because an adversary may be either an FL client, a server, or an external attacker. Existing defenses against MI attacks rely on perturbations to either the model's output predictions or the training process. However, output perturbations are ineffective in an FL setting, because a malicious server can access the model without output perturbation while training perturbations struggle to achieve a good utility. This paper proposes a novel defense, called CIP, to fortify FL against MI attacks via a client-level input perturbation during training and inference procedures. The key insight is to shift each client's local data distribution via a personalized perturbation to get a shifted model. CIP achieves a good balance between privacy and utility. Our evaluation shows that CIP causes accuracy to drop at most 0.7% while reducing attacks to random guessing.}

	abstract = {In this work, we propose ReFace, a real-time, highly-transferable attack on face recognition models based on Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATNs). Past attacks on face recognition models require the adversary to solve an input-dependent optimization problem using gradient descent making the attack impractical in real-time. Such adversarial examples are also tightly coupled to the victim model and are not as successful in transferring to different models. We find that the white-box attack success rate of a pure U-Net ATN falls substantially short of gradient-based attacks like PGD on large face recognition datasets. We therefore propose a new architecture for ATNs that closes this gap while maintaining a 10000X speedup over PGD. Furthermore, we find that at a given perturbation magnitude, our ATN adversarial perturbations are more effective in transferring to new face recognition models than PGD. We demonstrate that our attacks transfer effectively to models with different architectures, loss functions, and training procedures. ReFace attacks can successfully deceive commercial face recognition services via transfer attack and reduce face identification accuracy from 82% to 16.4% for AWS SearchFaces API and Azure face verification accuracy from 91% to 50.1%.}

	abstract = {Obfuscation has been widely employed to protect software from the malicious reverse analysis. However, its security risks have not previously been studied in detail. For example, most obfuscation methods introduce large blocks of opaque code that are black boxes to normal users. In this paper, we show that, indeed, obfuscation can increase the attack risk. Existing gadget search tools, while able to find more gadgets in obfuscated code, do not succeed in assembling them into more exploits. However, these tools use strict pattern matching, greedy searching strategies, and only very simple gadgets. We develop Gadget-Planner, a more flexible approach to building code-reuse attacks that overcomes previous limitations via symbolic execution and automated planning. In a study across both benchmark and real-world programs, this approach finds many more exploit payloads on obfuscated programs, both in terms of number and diversity.}

	abstract = {As an essential part of the website, JavaScript greatly enriches its functions. At the same time, JavaScript has become the most common attack payload on malicious websites. Although researchers are constantly proposing methods to detect malicious JavaScript, the emergence of obfuscation technology makes it difficult for previous approaches to detect disguised malicious JavaScript effectively. To solve this problem, we find that there are fixed templates for generating obfuscated code, which makes the original and obfuscated script have a mapping relationship in their structure. The structure information of the code is critical for malicious detection. Therefore, this paper proposes TransAST, a novel static detection method for obfuscated malicious JavaScript. Our approach's key is restoring the obfuscated JavaScript structure information by training the machine translation model. The experiment shows it can achieve 91.35% accuracy and 94.57% recall in the public dataset, which is 5.5% and 10.94% higher than the existing optimal method.}

	abstract = {Due to the convenience and popularity of Web applications, they have become a prime target for attackers. As the main programming language for Web applications, many methods have been proposed for detecting malicious JavaScript, among which static analysis-based methods play an important role because of their high effectiveness and efficiency. However, obfuscation techniques are commonly used in JavaScript, which makes the features extracted by static analysis contain many useless and disguised features, leading to many false positives and false negatives in detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel method to find out the essential features related to the semantics of JavaScript code. Specifically, we develop JS-Revealer, a robust, effective, scalable, and interpretable detector for malicious JavaScript. To test the capabilities of JSRevealer, we conduct comparative experiments with four other state-of-the-art malicious JavaScript detection tools. The experimental results show that JSRevealer has an average F1 of 84.8% on the data obfuscated by different obfuscators, which is 21.6%, 22.3%, 18.7%, and 22.9% higher than the tools CUJO, ZOZZLE, JAST, and JSTAP, respectively. Moreover, the detection results of JSRevealer can be interpreted, which can provide meaningful insights for further security research.}

	abstract = {The increasing use of information and communication technology in power grids and connected e-mobility infrastructures enables cyber attacks. E-mobility infrastructure components such as Charge Points (CPs) or Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be used as attack vector on power grids via False Data Injection (FDI) or Manipulation of demand (Mad) attacks. To detect such attacks, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which are adapted to the specifics of e-mobility are required. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid IDS for detecting e-mobility-based attacks on the power grid consisting of a rule-based IDS and an anomaly detection component using regression-based forecasting. The IDS is distributed among different e-mobility-related backend systems, namely Charge Point Operators (CPOs) and grid operators. We implemented our IDS and evaluate it on several data sets while simulating realistic attack scenarios to show the effectiveness of our approach. Our evaluation compares different IDS design choices and regression models. Especially, decision tree regression proved to be an effective base for detection at CPOs. By combining the distributed IDS reports of individual CPOs at the grid operator, the overall detection performance is further improved. The distributed nature of the system allows it to identify large-scale attacks effectively and thus robustly detect realistic threats to power grid operation.}

	abstract = {Swarm robotics, particularly drone swarms, are used in various safety-critical tasks. While a lot of attention has been given to improving swarm control algorithms for improved intelligence, the security implications of various design choices in swarm control algorithms have not been studied. We highlight how an attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities in swarm control algorithms to disrupt drone swarms. Specifically, we show that the attacker can target a swarm member (target drone) through GPS spoofing attacks, and indirectly cause other swarm members (victim drones) to veer from their course, resulting in a collision with an obstacle. We call these Swarm Propagation Vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SwarmFuzz, a fuzzing framework to capture the attacker's ability, and efficiently find such vulnerabilities in swarm control algorithms. SwarmFuzz uses a combination of graph theory and gradient-guided optimization to find the potential attack parameters. Our evaluation on a popular swarm control algorithm shows that SwarmFuzz achieves an average success rate of 48.8% in finding vulnerabilities, and compared to random fuzzing, has a 10x higher success rate, and 3x lower runtime. We also find that swarms of a larger size are more vulnerable to this attack type, for a given spoofing distance.}

	abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are vulnerable to malware, which is a key security risk for Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Existing attestation solutions are invasive because they require hardware security modules and software upgrades in legacy devices. We propose DNAttest, a Digital-twin-based Noninvasive Attestation solution to attest PLC behaviors in near-real time. DNAttest requires minimal ICS infrastructure changes and does not interfere with normal ICS operations. DNAttest detects PLC deviations by replicating all input messages for a PLC to its digital twin and comparing their output messages. Due to transient uncertainty in the PLC's internal processing state, DNAttest may output an incorrect comparison. To generate all plausible output values for comparison, we instantiate multiple emulated PLCs by replicating input messages with different timing profiles. We demonstrate on a close-to-real-world power grid testbed that DNAttest can provide a timely detection of a wide range of attacks non-invasively and accurately. DNAttest solution is lightweight and scalable. A typical desktop PC can attest more than 20 actual PLCs even if we use 10 emulators to monitor every actual PLC.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, industries are looking into virtualization as an effective means to build safe applications, thanks to the isolation it can provide among virtual machines (VMs) running on the same hardware. In this context, a fundamental issue is understanding to what extent the isolation is guaranteed, despite possible (or induced) problems in the virtualization mechanisms. Uncovering such isolation issues is still an open challenge, especially for hardware-assisted virtualization, since the search space should include all the possible VM states (and the linked hypervisor state), which is prohibitive. In this paper, we propose IRIS, a framework to record (learn) sequences of inputs (i.e., VM seeds) from the real guest execution (e.g., OS boot), replay them as-is to reach valid and complex VM states, and finally use them as valid seed to be mutated for enabling fuzzing solutions for hardware-assisted hypervisors. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of IRIS in automatically reproducing valid VM behaviors, with no need to execute guest workloads. We also provide a proof-of-concept fuzzer, based on the proposed architecture, showing its potential on the Xen hypervisor.}

Yet, many of these mitigations do not address the challenge of software resilience and availability, i.e., whether a system can continue to carry out its function and remain responsive, while being under attack and subjected to malicious inputs. In this paper we propose secure rewind and discard of isolated domains as an efficient and secure method of improving the resilience of software that is targeted by run-time attacks. In difference to established approaches, we rely on compartmentalization instead of replication and checkpointing. We show the practicability of our methodology by realizing a software library for Secure Domain Rewind and Discard (SDRaD) and demonstrate how SDRaD can be applied to real-world software.}

	abstract = {Virtualization is drawing attention due to countless benefits, leaving Hypervisors with the paramount responsibility for performance, dependability, and security. However, while there are consolidated approaches to assessing the performance and dependability of virtualized systems, solutions to assess security are very limited. Key difficulties are evaluating the system in the presence of unknown attacks and vulnerabilities and comparing the security attributes of different systems and configurations when an intrusion occurs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept and approach of intrusion injection for virtualized environments, which consists of directly driving the system into the erroneous states that mimic the ones resulting from actual intrusions (in the same way errors are injected to mimic the effects of residual faults). We present a prototype capable of injecting erroneous states related to memory-corruption in the Xen Hypervisor to show that the concept and approach proposed here are feasible. The prototype is evaluated using publicly disclosed exploits across three different versions of Xen. Results show that our tool can inject erroneous states equivalent to those resulting from attacks that exploit existing vulnerabilities, even on versions where those vulnerabilities do not exist.}

	abstract = {Web servers service client requests, some of which might cause the web server to perform security-sensitive operations (e.g. money transfer, voting). An attacker may thus forge or maliciously manipulate such requests by compromising a web client. Unfortunately, a web server has no way of knowing whether the client from which it receives a request has been compromised or not-current “best practice” defenses such as user authentication or network encryption cannot aid a server as they all assume web client integrity. To address this shortcoming, we propose vWitness, which “witnesses” the interactions of a user with a web page and certifies whether they match a specification provided by the web server, enabling the web server to know that the web request is user-intended. The main challenge that vWitness overcomes is that even benign clients introduce unpredictable variations in the way they render web pages. vWitness differentiates between these benign variations and malicious manipulation using computer vision, allowing it to certify to the web server that 1) the web page user interface is properly displayed 2) observed user interactions are used to construct the web request. Our vWitness prototype achieves compatibility with modern web pages, is resilient to adversarial example attacks and is accurate and performant-vWitness achieves 99.97% accuracy and adds 197ms of overhead to the entire interaction session in the average case.}

This work studies modern webpage fingerprinting adversaries against the TLS protocol; aiming to shed light on their capabilities and inform potential defences. Despite the importance of this research area (the majority of global Internet users rely on standard web browsing with TLS) and the potential real-life impact, most past works have focused on attacks specific to anonymity networks (e.g., Tor). We introduce a TLS-specific model that: 1) scales to an unprecedented number of target webpages, 2) can accurately classify thousands of classes it never encountered during training, and 3) has low operational costs even in scenarios of frequent page updates. Based on these findings, we then discuss TLS-specific countermeasures and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing padding capabilities provided by TLS 1.3.}

	abstract = {Illicit websites are restricted by governments and application marketplaces due to their detrimental impact on society. Third-party web services play a crucial role in enabling illicit webmasters to establish websites rapidly and evade detection. In this paper, we discover that third-party services usually assign unique credentials to website developers as their identifications (IDs). Websites using the same services with identical IDs are likely to be hosted on shared infrastructures and have textually similar domain names. This observation sparks the idea of building a community of illicit websites by leveraging third-party service IDs. Therefore, we design IDTracker, a novel system for detecting illicit website communities based on domain name semantic and infrastructure relationship features, which empower classification algorithms to achieve a high F1 score of 0.8968. Furthermore, we deploy IDTracker on an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) environment for three months and identify 6,830 illicit communities containing 165,378 illicit websites. Many of these illicit websites can not be identified by the most sophisticated engines, such as Symantec and Baidu, because of the cloaking tactics. In addition, we conduct a large-scale and long-term measurement on the network infrastructures and third-party services of illicit communities, revealing new phenomena. Our findings can help security communities to thwart illicit websites more effectively.}

	abstract = {DDoSim, a simulation testbed for mimicking real-world, large-scale botnet DDoS attacks, is presented. DDoSim offers various capabilities, including running user-specified software, testing botnet-recruitment exploits, and measuring the severity of resulting DDoS attacks. DDoSim leverages NS3DockerEmulator's Docker and NS-3 integration to load Docker containers with actual binaries and connect them over a simulated NS-3 network. DDoSim is validated through a comparison with results from real hardware experiments. This paper focuses on the results of an experiment series concerning deploying a memory error botnet on IoT devices. Unlike the Mirai attack, which relies on default credentials, these experiments exploit memory error vulnerabilities to access IoT devices. DDoSim also implements realistic IoT churn, reflecting dynamic network conditions in real-world IoT environments. The results reveal that memory error vulnerabilities enable botnet recruitment, while network conditions, attack size, and duration all have a proportional impact on target servers. DDoSim is publicly available for researchers' use.}

	abstract = {It has been extensively discussed that online services, such as shopping websites, may exploit dark user interface (UI) patterns to mislead users into performing unwanted and even harmful activities on the UI, e.g., subscribing to recurring purchases unknowingly. Most recently, the growing popularity of mobile platforms has led to an ever-extending reach of dark UI patterns in mobile apps, leading to security and privacy risks to end users. A systematic study of such patterns, including how to detect and mitigate them on mobile platforms, unfortunately, has not been conducted. In this paper, we fill the research gap by investigating the dark UI patterns in mobile apps. Specifically, we show the prevalence of the asymmetric dark UI patterns (AUI) in real-world apps, and reveal their risks by characterizing the AUI (e.g., subjects, hosts, and patterns). Then, through user studies, we demonstrate the demand for effective solutions to mitigate the potential risks of AUI. To meet the needs, we propose DARPA - an end-to-end and generic CV-based solution to identify AUIs at run-time and mitigate the risks by highlighting the AUIs with run-time UI decoration. Our evaluation shows that DARPA is highly accurate and introduces negligible overhead. Additionally, running DARPA does not require any modifications to the apps being analyzed and to the operating system.}

	abstract = {With diverse functionalities and advanced platform applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices extensively interact with each other, and these interactions govern the legitimate device state transitions. At the same time, attackers can easily manipulate these devices, and it is difficult to detect covert device control. In this work, we propose the device interaction graph, which uses device interactions to profile normal device behavior. We also formalize two types of device anomalies, and present an anomaly detection system CausalIoT. It can automatically construct the graph and validate runtime device events. For any violation of interaction executions, CausalIoT further checks whether it can trigger unexpected interaction executions and tracks the affected devices.1 Compared with existing methods, CausalIoT achieves the highest detection accuracy for abnormal device state transitions (95.2% precision and 96.8% recall). Moreover, we are the first to detect unexpected interaction executions, and CausalIoT successfully reports 91.9% anomaly chains on real-world testbeds.}

	abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) systems generate a large amount of unstructured/alphanumeric log messages that capture the health state of their components. Due to their design complexity, HPC systems often undergo failures that halt applications (e.g., weather prediction, aerodynamics simulation) execution. However, existing failure prediction methods, which typically seek to extract some information theoretic features, fail to scale both in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, limiting their adoption in real-time production systems. In this paper, differently from existing work and inspired by current transformer-based neural networks which have revolutionized the sequential learning in the natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we propose a novel scalable log-based, self-supervised model (i.e., no need for manual labels), called Time Machine 1 1 A Time Machine allows us to travel into the future to observe the health state of HPC system and report back. Here, we travel into the log extension to report an upcoming failure., that predicts (i) forthcoming log events (ii) the upcoming failure and its location and (iii) the expected lead time to failure. Time Machine is designed by combining two stacks of transformer-decoders, each employing the self-attention mechanism. The first stack addresses the failure location by predicting the sequence of log events and then identifying if a failure event is part of that sequence. The lead time to predicted failure is addressed by the second stack. We evaluate Time Machine on four real-world HPC log datasets and compare it against three state-of-the-art failure prediction approaches. Results show that Time Machine significantly outperforms the related works on Bleu, Rouge, MCC, and F1-score in predicting forthcoming events, failure location, failure lead-time, with higher prediction speed.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud systems, an increasing number of service workloads are deployed in the private cloud and/or public cloud. Although large cloud providers such as Azure and Google have published workload traces in the past, prior work has not focused on analyzing and characterizing the differences between private and public cloud workloads in detail. Based on our experience working with Azure, one of the most widely used cloud platforms in the world, we find that the workload characteristics are different between the private and public cloud workloads. Specifically, compared with the public cloud workloads, the private cloud workloads tend to be more homogeneous in both deployment sizes and utilization patterns, more static with occasional bursts in deployment characteristics, and more region-agnostic regarding the sensitivity to deployed regions. Our findings gain several insights and implications on cloud management and motivate us to build a centralized workload knowledge base.}

	abstract = {Recent research efforts on 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) have achieved outstanding performance by adopting neural networks. However, the robustness of these complex models have not been systematically analyzed. Given that PCSS has been applied in many safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, it is important to fill this knowledge gap, especially, how these models are affected under adversarial samples. As such, we present a comparative study of PCSS robustness. First, we formally define the attacker's objective under performance degradation and object hiding. Then, we develop new attack by whether to bound the norm. We evaluate different attack options on two datasets and three PCSS models. We found all the models are vulnerable and attacking point color is more effective. With this study, we call the attention of the research community to develop new approaches to harden PCSS models.}

An attacker of such a system aims at doing as much damage as possible, but might be limited by a cost budget. The maximum possible damage for a given cost budget is an important security metric of a system. In this paper, we find the maximum damage given a cost budget by modelling this problem with ATs, both in deterministic and probabilistic settings. We show that the general problem is NP-complete, and provide heuristics to solve it. For general ATs these are based on integer linear programming. However when the AT is tree-structured, then one can instead use a faster bottom-up approach. We also extend these methods to other problems related to the cost-damage tradeoff, such as the cost-damage Pareto front.}

The DSL is implemented with open source tooling, realized as a Visual Studio Code Extension using Langium for the language server and Sprotty for the visualization.

	abstract = {Distributed key generation (DKG) allows bootstrapping threshold cryptosystems without relying on a trusted party, nowadays enabling fully decentralized applications in blockchains and multiparty computation (MPC). While we have recently seen new advancements for asynchronous DKG (ADKG) protocols, their performance remains the bottleneck for many applications, with only one protocol being implemented (DYX+ ADKG, IEEE S&P 2022). DYX+ ADKG relies on the Decisional Composite Residuosity assumption (being expensive to instantiate) and the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, incurring a high latency (more than 100s with a failure threshold of 16). Moreover, the security of DYX+ ADKG is based on the random oracle model (ROM) which takes hash function as an ideal function; assuming the existence of random oracle is a strong assumption, and up to now, we cannot find any theoretically-sound implementation. Furthermore, the ADKG protocol needs public key infrastructure (PKI) to support the trustworthiness of public keys. The strong models (ROM and PKI) further limit the applicability of DYX+ ADKG, as they would add extra and strong assumptions to underlying threshold cryptosystems. For instance, if the original threshold cryptosystem works in the standard model, then the system using DYX+ ADKG would need to use ROM and PKI. In this paper, we design and implement a modular ADKG protocol that offers improved efficiency and stronger security guarantees. We explore a novel and much more direct reduction from ADKG to the underlying blocks, reducing the computational overhead and communication rounds of ADKG in the normal case. Our protocol works for both the low-threshold and high-threshold scenarios, being secure under the standard assumption (the well-established discrete logarithm assumption only) in the standard model (no trusted setup, ROM, or PKI).}

However, various attacks can be launched against smart speakers to execute malicious commands, which may cause serious safety or security issues. The existing solutions against sophisticated attacks such as voice replay attacks and voice synthesis attacks require intrusive modifications of the smart speaker hardware and/or software, which are impractical for general users. In this work, we present a novel security scheme- VoiceGuard that can effectively detect and block unauthorized voice commands to smart speakers. VoiceGuard does not require any modification to smart speakers' hardware or software. We implement a prototype of VoiceGuard on two popular smart speakers: Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini, and evaluate the scheme in three real-world testbeds, which include both single-user and multi-user scenarios. The experimental results show that VoiceGuard achieves an accuracy of 97% in blocking malicious voice commands issued by illegitimate sources while having a negligible impact on the user experience.}

	abstract = {Smart home voice assistants (VAs) such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become popular because of the convenience they provide through voice commands. VAs continuously listen to detect the wake command and send the subsequent audio data to the manufacturer-owned cloud service for processing to identify actionable commands. However, research has shown that VAs are prone to replay attack and accidental activations when the wake words are spoken in the background (either by a human or played through a mechanical speaker). Existing privacy controls are not effective in preventing such misactivations. This raises privacy and security concerns for the users as their conversations can be recorded and relayed to the cloud without their knowledge. Recent studies have shown that the visual gaze plays an important role when interacting with conservation agents such as VAs, and users tend to turn their heads or body toward the VA when invoking it. In this paper, we propose a device-free, non-obtrusive acoustic sensing system called HeadTalk to thwart the misactivation of VAs. The proposed system leverages the user's head direction information and verifies that a human generates the sound to minimize accidental activations. Our extensive evaluation shows that HeadTalk can accurately infer a speaker's head orientation with an average accuracy of 96.14% and distinguish human voice from a mechanical speaker with an equal error rate of 2.58%. We also conduct a user interaction study to assess how users perceive our proposed approach compared to existing privacy controls. Our results suggest that HeadTalk can not only enhance the security and privacy controls for VAs but do so in a usable way without requiring any additional hardware.}
