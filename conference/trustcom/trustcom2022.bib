	abstract = {Secure boot is an effective defense mechanism against attacks on system images. However, traditional secure boot mechanisms could not well serve in the IoT scenario. They usually integrate the root key and cryptographic algorithms used for boot authentication into read-only storage like on-chip ROM, which can only be written by the manufacturer and are unchangeable once written. Modification of cryptographic algorithms and root key is sometimes necessary in the IoT scenario. First, some on-the-market IoT devices are shipped with vulnerable cryptographic algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, RSA-1024) that need to be updated. Second, when transferring the ownership of IoT devices, it may be essential to change the root key of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a secure boot solution for IoT devices, which supports changing the root key and cryptographic algorithms flexibly. Specifically, we store the secure boot associated codes and data in the eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard), which is a storage device widely deployed on IoT devices. We leverage the write protection mechanism of eMMC to prevent the codes and data from being tampered with by the runtime codes. In addition, a secure cryptographic algorithms and root key updating mechanism has been introduced, which allows only legal updating requests by verifying the identity of the requester. The experimental results show that the scheme can boot the system securely with negligible overhead.}

	abstract = {Using the features of malicious family to detect malicious code can improve the analysis efficiency and reduce the workload. Aiming at the problems of low efficiency and low accuracy of classifiers in analyzing and detecting malicious code using traditional machine learning, a new malicious family identification method 2MFI-FT is proposed. Firstly, the more comprehensive and essential features of malicious code are obtained by extracting local feature information, assembly instruction set information and visible string information. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of inconsistent images generated by feature sequences, different feature grayscale images are fused into a multi-channel mapping feature image (2MFI) based on the signature matrix. Thirdly, in view of the high cost of collecting and labeling enough data, a classification model with high recognition accuracy and strong generalization ability is realized, based on the fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The regularization technique is also used to improve the robustness of the model. It is tested on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed 2MFI method for multi-channel feature image visualization has good identification effect and low time consumption when used as the input of the network model. At the same time, the 2MFI-FT method combined with fine-tuned CNN can accurately identify malicious families, and the accuracy on small training sets and large training sets can reach about 98.25% and 99.68% respectively, which provides a feasible solution for effective identification of malicious families.}

	abstract = {To realize data sovereignty, the International Data Space (IDS), adopting usage policies to determine how, when and where other enterprises or individuals may use data, has been proposed by the IDS association and widely received attention from academia and industry. However, because data in the IDS are transferred across domains, existing policy creation approaches for a single domain cannot be applied in the IDS. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a negotiation scheme to create usage policies in the IDS. In detail, we formulate usage policy negotiation as a combinatorial auction problem and adopt the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to incentivize potential data providers to truthfully negotiate usage policies. Both theoretical and simulation results show that our scheme maintains truthfulness on data providers and is cost-efficient.}

	abstract = {As an essential branch of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides users with efficiency and convenience for travel and is gradually replacing vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) as an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the rapidly changing network topology and various communication capabilities, the IoV is confronted with more complex network security risks than IoT, such as trust and reputation. To prevent dishonest or malicious nodes from interfering with the IoV communication, we have proposed a Gated Linear Unit (GLU) based trust management system (GTMS) with blockchain in this paper. In the GTMS, the trust level of the node is dynamically adjusted to each message sent, which utilizes the GLU network model with hybrid trust feature extraction to calculate the value instead of a fixed formula. In addition, we design a method based on the blockchain for storing the global trust value. Road Side Units (RSUs) record the trust level adjustment with the modified blockchain technology, which customizes mining difficulty according to the nodeâ€™s condition. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GTMS can detect malicious nodes among the road simulation with greater accuracy than the state-of-the-art method.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) rely heavily on trustworthy message exchanges between vehicles to enhance traffic efficiency and transport safety. Although cryptography-based methods are capable of alleviating threats from unauthenticated attackers, they can not prevent attacks from those legitimate network participants. This paper proposes a trust model to deal with attackers from the latter case, who can tamper with their received messages and deliberately decrease the trust value of benign vehicles. The trust evaluation process is formed by two stages: (i) the local trust evaluation at vehicles and (ii) trust aggregation on Road Side Units (RSUs). In the local trust evaluation stage, vehicles detect attacks and calculate the trust value for others in a distributed manner. Also, the social metrics of vehicles are calculated based on interaction records and trajectories. In the trust aggregation stage, each RSU collects local data from nearby vehicles and derives aggregation weights from the eigenvector centrality of the local trust network and social metrics. Then the RSU broadcasts the aggregated trust value towards vehicles in proximity. These vehicles can thus obtain a more accurate and comprehensive view. Vehicles with trust value below a preset threshold will be considered malicious. Extensive simulations based on the ONE simulator show that the proposed model (TECS) outperforms another benchmark model (IWOT-V) regarding the malicious vehicle detection and the delivery rate of authentic messages.}

	abstract = {Accurately constructing dynamic network topology is one of the core tasks to provide on-demand security services to the ubiquitous network. Existing schemes cannot accurately construct dynamic network topologies in time. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to construct the ubiquitous network topology. Firstly, ubiquitous network nodes are divided into three categories: terminal node, sink node, and control node. On this basis, we propose two operation primitives (i.e., addition and subtraction) and three atomic operations (i.e., intersection, union, and fusion), and design a series of algorithms to describe the network change and construct the network topology. We further use our scheme to depict the specific time-varying network topologies, including Satellite Internet and Internet of things. It demonstrates that their communication and security protection modes can be efficiently and accurately constructed on our scheme. The simulation and theoretical analysis also prove that the efficiency of our scheme, and effectively support the orchestration of protection capabilities.}

	abstract = {With the Android system becoming the most popular operating system for mobile smart terminals, it is more likely to be targeted by malware. Therefore, many researches of malicous detection have emerged. Most of the features extracted of current malicious detection are discrete, such as single permission, single API, single component, API sequences and so on. These features can only detect the maliciousness of Android applications, but cannot characterize the malicious behavior of Android applications through these features. In this paper,we propose a method to automatically mine malicious features by pruning the function call graph(FCG) of Android applications. These extracted features not only have a good representation for the malicious behavior of Android applications, but also can efficiently detect the malicious. The method uses simhash to characterize the pruned subgraphs of FCG, and selects the subgraphs which play a decisive role in determining maliciousness as malicious features. These malicious features are then used for malicious detection of Android applications. The verification on public datasets shows that our method has a good effect of more than 97% in malicous detection of Android applications.}

This paper proposes a lightweight IoT Honeynet based on the MQTT. It manages the honeypot devices in the IoT network through a custom protocol. At the same time, the number of honeypots can be dynamically adjusted according to the current attacked state of the IoT network to save its resources, and the logs of the honeypots can also be collected by the honeynet as an important basis for analyzing hacker attacks. Finally, the experimental result proved the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Shortest distance queries over large-scale graphs bring great benefits to various applications, i.e., save planning time and travelling expenses. To protect the sensitive nodes and edges in the graph, a user outsources an encrypted graph to an untrusted server without losing the query ability. However, no prior work has considered the user requirement of the shortest path with k unsorted nodes. In particular, we are concerned with how to securely find the shortest path by passing k nodes that do not have a fixed traverse order. To solve the problems, we propose Gespun (stands for Graph encryption for shortest path queries with k unordered nodes). It includes an oracle encryption scheme that is provably secure against the semi-honest server. Specifically, we compute the shortest paths and distances for all nodes locally to obtain path-distance oracles. We transform the shortest paths to a sequence of secure codes by using a pseudo-random permutation to protect the structure privacy. We encrypt the shortest distance by using additively homomorphic encryption. Second, we pack the oracles in link-list nodes and store them in an array-based dictionary after another permutation. Next, we construct a search graph to compute the shortest path while guaranteeing that the path passes the required k nodes. We formally prove that Gespun is adaptively semantically-secure in the random oracle. We implement a prototype of Gespun and evaluate its performance. Experiments results demonstrate that Gespun is efficient, e.g., a query over 6301 nodes, 20777 edges, and 5 unsorted nodes only needs 483 ms to get queried results. We believe that our research problem span new research that soon promotes a new line of graph encryption schemes.}

	abstract = {Backboned by smart meter networks, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs) play a critical role in smart grids. This paper studies a new False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) scenario targeting AMIs, in which the attacker injects and propagates computer worms (i.e., false data codes) to maliciously increase the readings of networked smart meters and create economic loss to the end customers. This paper establishes the false data code propagation and attack models in such a scenario; based on this, this paper proposes a differential game model for describing the attack and defense process for FDIA against AMIs. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve the proposed differential model and obtain the potential Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy pair. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under different energy tariff structures.}

	abstract = {VPN has posed many difficulties for network security management. In this paper, we develop a robust method to classify the VPN traffic. Firstly, we investigate the VPN transmission process and find the turning packet interval (Named as TPI) is a valuable feature for VPN traffic classification. Then we employ the probability distribution of TPI to improve the robustness of classification process, which is named as TPIPD. Secondly, we evaluate our method using the ISCXVPN2016 dataset and find our method has higher classification accuracy compared with other related methods. We also find the distribution of the first few TPIs can be used to represent that of the entire TPIs of specific flow, thus our method can be used for online traffic classification. As TPIPD is a kind of probability feature, it is more robust than other traditional features. Finally, the experiments verify our methods can be used for mice flow identification.}

	abstract = {Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) play a crucial role in safeguarding the security of protected computer networks. Although numerous machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, have achieved remarkable results, their generalization ability is limited due to the following critical challenges. First, most of existing methods heavily rely on the handcrafted features extracted from packets or network flows. Second, few studies have been devoted to adaptively highlighting the characteristics of certain traffic features and thus extracting discriminative representations from input network data. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level ATTention-enhanced rEpresentation leaRning model (MATTER) to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, a multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to extracted representations from the raw packet content of a network flow. Then, a multi-level attention module with spatial, channel and temporal attention mechanisms is leveraged to enhance the discrimination of the extracted features. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed MATTER is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and F1 score.}

	abstract = {Collaborative software development platforms like GitHub have gained tremendous popularity. Unfortunately, many users have reportedly leaked authentication secrets (e.g., textual passwords and API keys) in public Git repositories and caused security incidents and finical loss. Recently, several tools were built to investigate the secret leakage in GitHub. However, these tools could only discover and scan a limited portion of files in GitHub due to platform API restrictions and band-width limitations. In this paper, we present SecretHunter, a real-time large-scale comprehensive secret scanner for GitHub. SecretHunter resolves the file discovery and retrieval difficulty via two major improvements to the Git cloning process. Firstly, our system will retrieve file metadata from repositories before cloning file contents. The early metadata access can help identify newly committed files and enable many bandwidth optimizations such as filename filtering and object deduplication. Secondly, SecretHunter adopts a reinforcement learning model to analyze file contents being downloaded and infer whether the file is sensitive. If not, the download process can be aborted to conserve bandwidth. We conduct a one-month empirical study to evaluate SecretHunter. Our results show that SecretHunter discovers 57% more leaked secrets than state-of-the-art tools. SecretHunter also reduces 85% bandwidth consumption in the object retrieval process and can be used in low-bandwidth settings (e.g., 4G connections).}

	abstract = {Various types of network protocol software vulnerabilities often result in considerable damage. However, existing root cause analysis methods, which rely on symbolic path tracing and the hardware processor tracing (PT) function, cannot be applied in protocol software. They are also limited by the restricted resources of embedded platforms and symbolic execution ability. Additionally, manually analysing vulnerabilities is typically labour intensive. To solve this problem, we propose SEEKER, the first root cause analysis method based on deterministic replay for multi-type network protocol vulnerabilities to automatically generate vulnerability analysis reports. By proposing a multilayer semantic model, SEEKER extracts fine-grained semantics, compares the extracted semantics with predefined vulnerability rules and finally generates an analysis report.We implemented and evaluated SEEKER against 7 vulnerability types, across 4 real-world software programs, covering 2 different platforms. The experimental results show that SEEKER can identify the root causes of multi-type vulnerabilities and even find 3 new 0-day vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, SEEKER demonstrates impressive adaptability and scalability. It can analyse one execution path that involves up to 135,437,793 instructions and upwards of 15,893,356 memory access requests.}

	abstract = {Recently emerged federated learning (FL) is an attractive distributed learning framework in which numerous wireless end-user devices can train a global model with the data remained autochthonous. Compared with the traditional machine learning framework that collects user data for centralized storage, which brings huge communication burden and concerns about data privacy, this approach can not only save the network bandwidth but also protect the data privacy. Despite the promising prospect, Byzantine attack, an intractable threat in conventional distributed network, is discovered to be rather efficacious against FL as well. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the state-of-the-art strategies for defending against Byzantine attacks in FL. We first provide a taxonomy for the existing defense solutions according to the techniques they used, followed by an across-the-board comparison and discussion. Then we propose a new Byzantine attack method called weight attack to defeat those defense schemes, and conduct experiments to demonstrate its threat. The results show that existing defense solutions, although abundant, are still far from fully protecting FL. Finally, we indicate possible countermeasures for weight attack, and highlight several challenges and future research directions for mitigating Byzantine attacks in FL.}

We implement this in an end-to-end prototype we call HAXSS.We compare our approach against a number of state-of-the-art black-box scanners on a new micro-benchmark for XSS payload generation, and on a macro-benchmark of established vulnerable web applications. HAXSS outperforms the other scanners on both benchmarks, identifying 131 vulnerabilities (a 20% improvement over the closest scanner), reporting 0 false positives. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is practically useful, as HAXSS re-discovers 4 existing CVEs and discovers 5 new CVEs in 3 production-grade web applications.}

AI-powered methods solve the defect that attackers can easily bypass because of the fixed threshold and weight in rule matching while still suffer from several issues. Such as the lack of malware samples for training, the amplified impact of even low FPR present enormous obstacles to applying the model in real-world detection.We present a method to generate malicious traffic covering an extensive sample space based on Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). We then propose a sticky mechanism, which transforms certain decision-making into dynamic human-computer interaction decision-making, to verify the suspicious hosts recognized by the AI model. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model by identifying eight kinds of real attacks precisely. The good performance on real-world traffic shows our method is a solid foothold for applying AI-powered detection to practical applications.}

	abstract = {Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) has become one of the most widely used attack techniques for software vulnerability exploitation. Existing ROP detection methods fall into two types: hardware-based methods and software-based methods. The former is strongly dependent on specific hardware architectures and difficult to deploy. Although the latter can alleviate these problems, limited by the selection of features and thresholds, it cannot effectively discover neither variant ROP nor delayed ROP. In this work, we propose an intelligent detection method at runtime and implement the corresponding prototype system, IDROP, which uses real-time execution flow and LSTM to discovery ROP and its variants. Specifically, IDROP analyzes the differences between program execution flows that are independent of the ROP feature thresholds. Firstly, the Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is utilized to instrument the tested program, and the sliding window mechanism is applied to screen out suspicious program execution flow snapshots. Then, these suspicious execution flow snapshots are vectorized through data representation techniques. Finally, we build and train an LSTM model to discover ROP. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of IDROP on a dataset consisting of 6000+ samples. The experimental results show that IDROP is effective in detecting ROP attacks, variant ROP and delayed ROP with an accuracy of 98%, 93% and 80%, respectively. In addition, IDROP has negligible space overhead and low performance overhead, which is similar to that of only using Pin for detection (about additional 2.5 times the program execution time before instrumentation).}

	abstract = {With the dramatic increase in malicious software, the sophistication and innovation of malware have increased over the years. In particular, the dynamic analysis based on the deep neural network has shown high accuracy in malware detection. However, most of the existing methods only employ the raw API sequence feature, which cannot accurately reflect the actual behavior of malicious programs in detail. The relationship between API calls is critical for detecting suspicious behavior. Therefore, this paper proposes a malware detection method based on the graph neural network. We first connect the API sequences executed by different processes to build a directed process graph. Then, we apply Bert to encode the API sequences of each process into node embedding, which facilitates the semantic execution information inside the processes. Finally, we employ GCN to mine the deep semantic information based on the directed process graph and node embedding. In addition to presenting the design, we have implemented and evaluated our method on 10,000 malware and 10,000 benign software datasets. The results show that the precision and recall of our detection model reach 97.84% and 97.83%, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

	abstract = {Recent works have demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while adversarial training is promising for improving robustness of deep networks. However, these models still remain vulnerable to new types of attacks not seen due to representative general samples may not be provided during training. Moreover, substantially larger datasets are necessary in adversarial robust models than those required for standard training where labeled data is expensive. In this work, we propose a novel approach to adversarial robustness, which establishes on the insights from min-max optimization that more powerful adversarial perturbations lead to more robust defense. Our algorithm is called Adversarial Training with Multidimensional Perturbations (ATMP), aims at guiding networks learn strong representations through minimizing the distance between differently augmented views via adopting an innovative contrastive learning objective function in the latent space. By perturbing the representations corresponding to key robust features, more powerful adversarial perturbations could be obtained in self-supervised form during adversarial training. Besides, we can avoid label leaking to some extent because no label information is required in generating adversarial examples. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks show that our method can achieve high robustness against various of representative adversarial attacks. We also compare it with the existing state-of-the-art techniques, and the experiments indicate that our method is superior.}

	abstract = {Current specific emitter identification methods based on deep learning face many challenges such as high computational effort, weak anti-interference capability, unstable signal feature extraction, and limited improvement in classification performance. To solve these challenges, a new deep learning method is proposed, namely Deep Residual Shrinking Networks with Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (DRSN-SimAM). The advantages of the parameter-free attention module and deep residual shrinkage network are integrated by DRSN-SimAM. The parameter-free attention module is introduced into the residual shrinkage building unit for adaptively learning thresholds, filtering out redundant information irrelevant to the signal fingerprint. We used the simple parameter-free attention module to enhance the ability of the model to learn features in strong noisy signals, with the goal of improving the classification of wireless devices. Experimental results reveal that the classification accuracy is as high as 98.8%. The number of parameters of the proposed DRSN-SimAM is 12.29% less than the number of parameters of the DRSN when the number of units is 11. Our proposed DRSN-SimAM is more effective in terms of improved wireless device identification performance and model size compression as compared to existing specific emitter identification methods based on deep learning.}

	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing, patients can obtain efficient and high-quality medical services by uploading their eHealth data to the cloud for sharing among medical personnel. Because eHealth data contain lots of sensitive information, they are always encrypted before uploading to protect patientsâ€™ privacy. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a commonly used cryptographic primitive since it achieves fine-grained and one-to-many access control on the encrypted data. However, encrypted eHealth data may become an obstacle for some healthcare scenarios, especially the emergency rescue scenes. In addition, the one-to-many access manner makes the traditional CP-ABE mechanism hard to track the identity of a traitor who sells the decryption privilege to others. In this paper, we propose an Emergency Access Control and Traceable (EmACT) attribute-based encryption scheme to address these issues. In addition, EmACT outsources the heavy bilinear computations of the decryption to the cloud, which means that EmACT is adaptable to the resource-constrained health-monitoring devices. The proposed schemeâ€™s security is formally proven, and the experimental results demonstrate that EmACT is efficient and practicable.}

	abstract = {Learning-based sketches have been widely studied as an improvement of traditional sketches that achieves high efficiency in terms of both time and space. It uses a learning model to reveal and exploit underlying patterns of input data for helping traditional sketches obtain accurate frequency estimation with memory efficient. However, recent studies only focus on the performance improvement of learning-based sketches and pay little attention to security. The potential security problems can be easily exploited by an adversary to make learning-based sketches inaccurate. In this paper, we firstly explore the security issues of learning-based sketches with regard to estimation accuracy and memory overhead. Some adversarial scenarios of learning model and backup sketch are modeled according to the knowledge and capabilities of an adversary. Then, we propose four attacks to deceive learning-based sketch, namely counterfeit attack, targeted point attack, memory occupation attack, and blind increment attack. We conduct a series of experiments based on real-world datasets and verify that the proposed attacks highly degrade the performance of learning-based sketch even when the adversary knows nothing about it.}

	abstract = {With the increase in the variety and quantity of malware, there is an urgent need to speed up the diagnosis and analysis of malware. Extracting the malware family-related tokens from AV (Anti-Virus) labels, provided by online antivirus engines, paves the way for pre-diagnosing the malware. Automatically extracting vital information from AV labels will greatly enhance the detection ability of security enterprises and equip the research ability of security analysts. Recent works like AVCLASS and AVCLASS2 try to extract the attributes of malware from AV labels and establish the taxonomy based on expert knowledge. However, due to the uncertain trend of complicated malicious behaviors, the system needs the following abilities to face the challenge: preserving vital semantics, being expansible, and being free from expert knowledge. In this work, we present AVMiner, an expansible malware tagging system that can mine the most vital tokens from AV labels. AVMiner adopts natural language processing techniques and clustering methods to generate a sequence of tokens without expert knowledge ranked by importance. AVMiner can self-update when new samples come. Finally, we evaluate AVMiner on over 8,000 samples from well-known datasets with manually labeled ground truth, which outperforms previous works.}

In this paper, we propose EnShare, a secure and practical file sharing system that leverages cooperation of server-side and client-side enclaves to enforce access control, with the former responsible for registration, authentication and access control enforcement and the latter performing file decryption. Such design significantly reduces the computation workload of server-side enclaves, thus capable of handling concurrent requests. Meanwhile, it also supports immediate permission revocation, since the file decryption keys inside the client-side enclaves are destroyed immediately after use. We implement a prototype of EnShare and the evaluation demonstrates it enforces access control securely with high throughput and low latency.}

	abstract = {Current steganalytic classifiers always need a large number of cover-stego image pairs for training. However in this paper we focus on a scenario where steganalysts have a few cover-stego image pairs in hand. Meanwhile steganalysts have no knowledge of the embedding algorithm, and cannot generate corresponding stego images after collecting additional cover images. Hence in this scenario steganalysts cannot match more cover-stego image pairs to augment the training set. To address this issue, we propose a stego feature simulation method to artificially generate cover-stego feature pairs for training. First, we design a cover-stego feature difference model to build the relationship between cover and stego features in pairs. Then, we estimate the model parameters from a few existing cover-stego image pairs in hand. Finally, after extracting steganalytic features from additionally collected cover images, we simulate corresponding stego features with the cover-stego feature difference model to match artificial feature pairs. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively mitigate the shortage of training image pairs by adding adequate artificial feature pairs into training.}

	abstract = {Legacy programs are normally monolithic (that is, all code runs in a single process and is not partitioned), and a bug in a program may result in the entire program being vulnerable and therefore untrusted. Program partitioning can be used to separate a program into multiple partitions, so as to isolate sensitive data or privileged operations. Manual program partitioning requires programmers to rewrite the entire source code, which is cumbersome, error-prone, and not generic. Automatic program partitioning tools can separate programs according to the dependency graph constructed based on data or programs. However, programmers still need to manually implement remote service interfaces for inter-partition communication. Therefore, in this paper, we propose AutoSlicer, whose purpose is to partition a program more automatically, so that the programmer is only required to annotate sensitive data. AutoSlicer constructs accurate data dependency graphs (DDGs) by enabling execution flow graphs, and the DDG-based partitioning algorithm can compute partition information based on sensitive annotations. In addition, the code refactoring toolchain can automatically transform the source code into sensitive and insensitive partitions that can be deployed on the remote procedure call framework. The experimental evaluation shows that AutoSlicer can effectively improve the accuracy (13%-27%) of program partitioning by enabling EFG, and separate real-world programs with a relatively smaller performance overhead (0.26%-9.42%).}

	abstract = {Memory corruption attacks have existed for multiple decades, and have become a major threat to computer systems. At the same time, a number of defense techniques have been proposed by research community. With the wide adoption of CPU-based memory safety solutions, sophisticated attackers tend to tamper with system memory via direct memory access (DMA) attackers, which leverage DMA-enabled I/O peripherals to fully compromise system memory. The Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) based solutions are widely believed to mitigate DMA attacks. However, recent works point out that attackers can bypass IOMMU-based protections by manipulating the DMA interfaces, which are particularly vulnerable to race conditions and other unsafe interactions.State-of-the-art hardware-supported memory protections rely on metadata to perform security checks on memory access. Consequently, the additional memory request for metadata results in significant performance degradation, which limited their feasibility in real world deployments. For quantitative analysis, we separate the total metadata access latency into DRAM latency, on-chip latency, and cache latency, and observe that the actual DRAM access is less than half of the total latency. To minimize metadata access latency, we propose EMC, a low-overhead heap memory safety solution that implements a tripwire based mechanism on the memory controller. In addition, by using memory controller as a natural gateway of various memory access data paths, EMC could provide comprehensive memory safety enforcement to all memory data paths from/to system physical memory. Our evaluation shows an 0.54% performance overhead on average for SPEC 2017 workloads.}

	abstract = {Due to the rich relational information of graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for fraud detection tasks, where the suspiciousness of nodes is identified by aggregating information about the neighbors of different relations. To bypass such detection, fraudsters camouflage themselves by providing seemingly legitimate feedback (i.e., feature camouflage) or connecting many legitimate users (i.e., relation camouflage). Moreover, when the label distribution of nodes is severely skewed, GNN-based algorithms may have limitations. To counteract the effect of disguised fraudsters under imbalanced graphs on fraud detection, we propose a cascaded GNN fraud detector with dual features (CGDF-GNN) in this paper. It tackles the impact of feature camouflage by applying a dual-feature parallel aggregation method and uses a cascaded neighbor aggregator to deal with the single-level learning problem arising from relational camouflage. Experiments on graph-based fraud detection tasks on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {WPA2-Enterprise networks offer access to the Internet widely for multifarious client devices. Certificate-based authentication is adopted on the client-side to authenticate the server during network connection. Due to a lack of professional knowledge, client users commonly fully trust the devices, which may result in insecure network connection and user credential leakage. Previous works commonly focus on the security vulnerabilities due to the design weaknesses of the user interfaces from mainstream operating systems, while the built-in certificate validation implementations, which act as a block box for users to validate the received certificates, are not taken into consideration.In this paper, we design a series of comprehensive testings to evaluate the built-in certificate validation implementations of mainstream client devices for the first time. Moreover, we investigate the configuration options provided by the devices from different vendors, which may downgrade the security of the certificate validation. We select both Windows and Android (from vendors with the largest five market share) devices as our empirical study target. The results show that more than one security vulnerability exists in the built-in certificate validation implementations of the selected devices, and all the selected devices provide a certain option which may downgrade the security of certificate validation. We also conduct a real Evil Twin attack, which reveals that the user credentials can be cracked due to the discovered security vulnerabilities. Our findings have been responsibly disclosed to the relevant device vendors, and we received an assortment of responses, meanwhile many vendors (e.g., Huawei) have already positively acknowledged our findings.}

	abstract = {With the increasing complexity of software composition, code defects have become a long-term problem in software security. Traditional static analysis techniques cannot exhaustively enumerate all unsafe modes, and problems such as low path coverage rate brought by dynamic detection techniques make software security vulnerability detection inefficient. Methods based on Natural Language Processing have promoted the research of code defect detection tasks; however, there are problems of insufficient code semantic learning and limited data processing by pre-trained models. To solve these problems, from the perspective of enriching model input semantics and improving the modelâ€™s ability to process data, based on the Transformer model, we propose a hierarchical compression encoder model CPGBERT to detect whether the target function has defects. By using the regularity of the program context and structure, the program code is sliced for the input-output variables related to the objective function and dependencies on the codesâ€™ propagation paths. Extract multiple code property graph information on rich semantics from the sliced program code for graph fusion, and embed the fused code property graph into the model by grouping. During the learning process, the independent hidden layer features are compressed and aggregated to make the model focus on the deep semantic learning of the objective function. The experiment uses the CodeXGLUE benchmark dataset and compares 6 kinds of code defect detection models having better performance to perform defect detection and effect evaluation on actual engineering code. The results show that the accuracy of the CPGBERT detection model is 67.97%, which is 5.89% higher than the CodeBERT model proposed by Microsoft and 1.35% higher than the state-of-the-art model CoTexT.}

The timely detection of unknown network attacks is a crucial defense measure to stop cybercrimes. However, the intricate organization and elaborate disguise make the previously unknown attacks hard to pinpoint.

To handle the class-imbalance problem in the training data, we introduced a genetic algorithm-inspired data augmentation, applying the selection-crossover model to generate additional rare-class data. Using the class centers learned by the t-SNE algorithm for the online triplets, we reduced the randomness in the loss function calculation for the Triplet network. The self-attention and channel attention help to find the correlations between the samples and strengthen the mapping power of the low-dimensional metric space. To test the proposed detection system, we used NSL-KDD datasets for evaluation. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods in other research, our system presented a better performance for detecting unknown attacks, with an accuracy of 87% for multi-class classification, improving over 2.8%.}

	abstract = {With the widespread abuse of information technology, pornographic and gambling websites develop rapidly. They affect the physical and mental health of children and endanger personal property. Therefore, it is necessary to detect them. However, the existing detection methods ignored that imperfect datasets are common in the scenario of pornographic and gambling websites which are hence adverse to the detection. Those imperfections specifically include sparse samples, mismatch and imbalanced datasets. In addition, over-reliance on visual features incurred high overhead.To overcome these shortcomings, we innovatively propose a lightweight graph-based method to detect pornographic and gambling websites through semi-supervised learning of textual content. The semi-supervised learning is to solve sparse samples and mismatch datasets, while the graph-based approach can combine the semi-supervised part with community discovery to deal with imbalanced datasets. Specifically, we perform the detection process with the utilization of modified TF-IDF and Louvain during the iteration and updating by the EM algorithm. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best 92.01% Macro-Avg-F1 with the shortest CPU time and outperforms all baselines. We also illustrate that the designed components in our model do contribute to the detection.}

	abstract = {With the help of satellites, Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as remote monitoring and ocean exploration can be realized. However, the network is vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the limited resources of satellite IoT (S-IoT) terminals and the openness of communication links. Ensuring that legitimate users can only access sensitive data remains a major concern. In this paper, a zero-trust access management model integrated with satellites, network and identity infrastructure, as well as the authentication protocol for S-IoT terminal security, was designed. The protocol adopts the Chinese cryptographic algorithms SM2, SM3, and SM4, combined with the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to achieve key agreement and bidirectional authentication. The security of this protocol is further analyzed, and its security, function, and performance are compared with other related protocols. Experimental results show that compared with existing similar schemes, the proposed protocol can more effectively consider the security requirements of S-IoT and reduce communication costs.}

	abstract = {DNS (Domain Name System) plays an important role in network communication and it is rarely blocked by firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). It is a suitable way for attackers to build DCC (DNS Covert Channel), which is used for data exfiltration. In recent years, some DCC detection methods have been proposed based on deep learning and there is no need for manual feature extraction. However, some expert knowledge is helpful to express the DNS characteristic. In this paper, we propose a FC-LSTM (Features Concatenation-based LSTM) model to detect DCC. The statistical features are concatenated with the output features of the LSTM model. This method makes the expression of DNS domain names more abundant. The experimental results have shown that the DCC traffic can be identified from normal traffic via this model, and the recognition rate is significantly improved compared with the traditional LSTM model and CNN model. In addition, we implement multi-classification in terms of the DCC tools (some of them are used in APT32). We also add generalization DNS packets (simulating APT34 traffic using DCC for stealing and attacking) to verify the robustness of our model. The FC-LSTM model has a good detection performance as well.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that 87 % to 96 % of the Android apps using cryptographic APIs have a misuse which may cause security vulnerabilities. As previous studies did not conduct a qualitative examination of the validity and severity of the findings, our objective was to understand the findings in more depth. We analyzed a set of 936 open-source Java applications for cryptographic misuses. Our study reveals that 88.10 % of the analyzed applications fail to use cryptographic APIs securely. Through our manual analysis of a random sample, we gained new insights into effective false positives. For example, every fourth misuse of the frequently misused JCA class MessageDigest is an effective false positive due to its occurrence in a non-security context. As we wanted to gain deeper insights into the security implications of these misuses, we created an extensive vulnerability model for cryptographic API misuses. Our model includes previously undiscussed attacks in the context of cryptographic APIs such as DoS attacks. This model reveals that nearly half of the misuses are of high severity, e.g., hard-coded credentials and potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks.}

	abstract = {To decrease the loss of stealing electricity on the smart grid, power theft detection (ETD) is widely concerned and studied. Due to missing values, invalid values, and non-linear data relationships in the grid data, existing electricity theft detection methods will generally lead to training errors, non-convergence, and low accuracy. To address those issues, we propose a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention method to detect electricity stealing behavior. Since the number of normal users in the grid is much larger than that of abnormal users, we propose an improved WGAN-GP (LWGAN-GP) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem. Based on the generated balanced dataset, CNN and BiLSTM are adopted to extract features from current data and historical data, respectively. To further improve the classification accuracy, we use an attention mechanism to assign weights to the relevant features. Moreover, experiments based on real datasets show that the ACC, AUC, and F1 of the proposed CNN-BiLSTM-Attention method are greater than those of the other three machine learning and deep learning models.}

	abstract = {Satellite Internet has broad emerging applications in aviation, marine, forest, disaster emergency and other fields. Since the openness of satellite Internet, it is extremely vulnerable to eavesdropping, replay, impersonation and other attacks, which may cause significant privacy and security concerns. To prevent malicious nodes from accessing and attacking satellite Internet, many authentication schemes have been proposed, but few of them consider the authentication and security of satellite nodes. In addition, most schemes assume that key management in network control center (NCC) is absolutely secure. But if it is maliciously attacked and the public-private key pairs are leaked, the entire system will crash immediately. In this paper, we propose CLASSI, a novel, secure and efficient certificateless authentication scheme for satellite Internet. CLASSI no longer assigns the complete public and private keys when users, satellites and gateway stations register, but uses their identity information to generate partial private keys. We make full use of the computing and storage capabilities of satellites to give satellites the ability to authenticate. We theoretically prove the security of our scheme through formal analysis and prove that our scheme can resist various of attacks. We also conducted extensive experiments and compared CLASSI with the existing schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that CLASSI is more suitable for user access in satellite Internet when meeting more security attributes.}

	abstract = {Threat tree model is widely used for risk analysis for software assurance. This model is convenient to convey the logical relations between various threat conditions that will result in a threat iteratively. However, tree representation imposes a limitation in that threat semantics can only present in a solely layered style in a tree structure, e.g., conditions represented by children nodes in the threat tree with edge relations in terms of "and" or "or" will result in the threat represented by the father node. It may not be sufficient for representing certain special cases such as cross-layer conditions, e.g., the nodes at different layers (a child and a uncle) may compose threat conditions, which cannot be represented in a regular tree style. In other words, the conditions represented by a child and a uncle may lead to a threat, either new or not. To extend the semantics of current threat tree model, in this paper, we propose a new threat tree model called tTree+, by extending and converting a non-layered tree representation to a layered tree presentation. Some algorithms are proposed by adding a duplicated node and rebuilding related layers, so that original algorithms for tree operations can be remained without any amendment. This extended tree model can extend the outreach of semantics for further threat analysis, so that the more complex threat can be described and analyzed.}

	abstract = {X-armed bandits have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in optimizing unknown stochastic continuous functions, which can model many machine learning tasks, specially in big data-driven personalized recommendation. However, bandit algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing works mainly focus on attacking multi-armed bandits in discrete setting; nevertheless, the attacks against X-armed bandits in continuous setting have not been well explored. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and investigate the robustness problem for the X-armed bandits. Specifically, we consider data poisoning attack and propose an attack algorithm named Confidence Poisoning Attack algorithm, which could hijack the clean tree-based X-armed bandits algorithm, i.e., high confidence tree (HCT) and make it choose the nodes including the arm targeted by the attacker very frequently with a sub-linear attack cost, i.e., O(T Î± )(0 <Î±< 1), where T is the total number of rounds. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed attack algorithm through theoretical analysis and experiments.}

	abstract = {Recently Command and Control (C&C) servers have attracted considerable attention in botnets and domain generation algorithms (DGAs) further enhance the stealth of C&C servers. However, Algorithmically Generated Domains (AGDs) generated by DGAs can be easily detected by previous DGA detection approaches. More specifically, the previous DGAs are hard to satisfy domain name rules, low repetition rate, and anti-detection in practical scenarios simultaneously. Designing an outstanding DGA has become a crucial issue from the botnet ownerâ€™s perspective. To mitigate these problems, we propose Cdga, a Controllable DGA via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which is a popular backbone model for text generation in the natural language processing (NLP) community.Controllable text generation approaches are adopted by Cdga to ensure no repetition in the generated domain names and compliance with the domain rules. In addition to cheating DGA detectors, GANs are exploited to equip Cdga with a powerful anti-detection ability. Furthermore, our proposed method uses the technique of NLP to force the AGDs to meet language rules, where the generated domain names are difficult for recognition by human. By utilizing the time-dependent seed, Cdga can dynamically generate domain names, ensuring that the malware can connect to the C&C server conditioned on a specific time stamp. Experimental results demonstrate that the domain names generated by our method are realistic enough to be resistant to the state-of-the-art DGA detectors.}

	abstract = {The human can easily recognize the incongruous parts of an image, for example, perturbations unrelated to the image itself, but are poor at spotting the small geometric transformations. However, in terms of the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs), the ability to properly recognize objects with small geometric transformations is still a challenge. In this work, we investigate the problem from the perspective of adversarial attacks: does the performance of DNNs degrade even when small geometric transformations are applied to images? To this end, we propose a novel adversarial attack method, called WBA, a Warping-Based Adversarial attack method, which does not introduce information independent of the original images but manipulates the existing pixels of the images by elastic warping transformations to generate adversarial examples that are imperceptible to the human eye. At the same time, existing adversarial attacks typically generate adversarial examples by modifying pixels in the spatial domain of the image, the addition of such perturbations introduces extra information unrelated to the image itself and is easily detected by the naked eyes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WBA by extensive experiments on commonly used datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. The results show that WBA can quickly generate adversarial examples with the highest adversarial strength, consumes less time, and can be comparable to optimization-based adversarial attack methods in image perception evaluation metrics such as LPIPS, SSIM, and far more than gradient direction-based iterative methods.}

	abstract = {Due to the prominent advantages of decentralization, transparency, security, and traceability, blockchain technologies have attracted ever-increasing attention from academia and industry, which can be applied to establish secure and reliable resource sharing platforms for future networks and applications. Especially, with the promising 6G technology which has large bandwidth and space-air-ground integrated coverage, blockchains have been evolved into 6G-enabled blockchain and envisioned to build various decentralized data and resource management systems. However, for 6G-enabled wireless blockchain networks, there still exist many challenges for their development and prosperity, e.g., large block propagation delay and propagation incentive. Therefore, this paper focuses on addressing the block propagation challenges. Firstly, inspired by epidemic models, we classify consensus nodes into five different states and establish a block propagation model for public blockchains that depicts block propagation laws. Then, considering consensus nodes are limited rational, we propose an Incentive Mechanism based on evolutionary game for Block Propagation (marked as BPIM) to minimize the block propagation delay. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with traditional routing algorithms, BPIM has better block propagation efficiency and greater incentive strength.}

	abstract = {The use of videoconferencing is on the rise after COVID-19, being common to look at the screen and see someone typing. A side-channel attack may be launched to infer the text written from the face image. In this paper, we analyse the feasibility of such an attack, being the first proposal which work with a complete keyset (50 keys) and natural texts. We use different scenarios, lighting conditions and natural texts to increase realism. Our study involves 30 participants, who typed 49,365 keystrokes. We characterize the effect of lighting, gender, age and use of glasses. Our results show that on average 13.71% of keystrokes are revealed without error, and up to 31.8%, 52.5% and 61.2% are guessed with a maximum error of 1, 2 and 3 keys, respectively.}

	abstract = {While many online platforms bring great benefits to their users by allowing user-generated content, they have also facilitated generation and spreading of harmful content such as rumors. Researcher have proposed different rumor detection methods based on features extracted from the original post and/or associated comments, but how comments affect the performance of such methods remains largely less understood. In this paper, we first propose a new BERT-based rumor detection method that can outperform other state-of-the-art methods, and then used it to study the role of comments in rumor detection. Our proposed method concatenates the original post and associated comments to form a single long text, which is then segmented into shorter chunks more suitable for BERT-based vectorization. Features extracted from all trunks are fed into a classifier based on an LSTM network or a transformer layer for the classification task. The experimental results on the PHEME and Ma-Weibo datasets proved the superior performance of our method. We conducted additional experiments on different settings of our proposed method to study different aspects of the role comments play in the rumor detection task. These additional experiments led to some very interesting findings, including the surprising result that fixed-length segmentation is better than natural segmentation, and the observation that including more comments can help improve the rumor detectorâ€™s performance. Some of these findings have profound operational implications for online platforms, e.g., commentators can contribute to rumor detection positively so online platforms can leverage the crowd intelligence to detect online rumors more effectively without applying overstrict content consensus policies.}

	abstract = {Malicious traffic detection is an important task in network security, which protects the target network from privacy leakage and service paralysis. The complexity of the network and the hierarchical structure of network traffic, i.e, byte-packet-flow, indicate the diversity of traffic information. Most of the existing work only uses one feature or statistical feature, and cannot learn network traffic from multiple perspectives, i.e, shortsighted, which results in the lack of important information in network traffic. Meanwhile, after obtaining multiple features, the effective fusion of multiple features is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Features Fusion with Attention Networks (MFFAN). According to the hierarchical structure of network traffic, we extract byte, packet, and statistical features from original traffic files to learn traffic from multiple perspectives, overcoming shortsighted. To effectively fuse multiple features, we use the self-attention to learn the intra-feature relationship with each feature and use the co-attention to learn the inter-feature relationship between features. We conduct experiments on the ISCIDS2012 dataset and CICIDS2017 dataset, and the results show that our model achieves an effective fusion of multiple features and high accuracy.}

Aiming at the problem that there is no complete and reliable security detection model for Android-based crypto wallets, this study provides an evaluation framework based on the standard Android application security detection and unique security assessment of crypto wallets. The framework presents an attack-based detection approach, which identifies potential wallet security issues by simulating attacks and exploiting vulnerabilities.

The test results demonstrate that the framework can accurately reflect the performance security of wallets.

	abstract = {Code-reuse attacks (including ROP/JOP) severely threaten computer security. Control-flow integrity (CFI), which can restrict control flow in legal scope, is recognised as an effective defence mechanism against code-reuse attacks. Hardware-based CFI uses Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions with additional hardware modules to implement CFI and achieve better performance. However, hardware-based fine-grained CFI adds new instructions to the ISA, which can not be executed on old processors and breaks the compatibility of programs. Some coarse-grained CFI designs, such as Intel IBT, maintain the compatibility of programs but can not provide enough security guarantees.To balance the security and compatibility of hardware CFI, we propose Transparent Forward CFI (TFCFI). TFCFI implements hardware-based fine-grained CFI designs without changing the ISA. The software modification of TFCFI utilizes address information and hint instructions in RISC-V as transparent labels to mark the program. The hardware module of TFCFI monitors the control flow during execution. The program modified by TFCFI can be executed on old processors without TFCFI. Benefiting from transparent labels, TFCFI also solves the destination equivalence problem. The experiment on FPGA shows that TFCFI incurs negligible performance overhead (1.82% on average).}

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge proof for any relation amongst committed values is crucial and widely applicable in the design of high level cryptographic schemes, especially in privacy-preserving protocols. Besides quantum resistance, efficiency is what we are most concerned about, including asymptotic efficiency and concrete efficiency. Jain et al. proposed a simple string commitment scheme based on the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem (JKPT12), and then designed zero-knowledge proofs for valid opening, linear relation and multiplicative relation of committed values. As a result, they got an efficient zero-knowledge proof for any circuit C, with communication complexity \\mathcal{O}(t|C|\\ell \\log \\ell ), where t is a security parameter measuring soundness and â„“ is the secret length of the LPN problem. In this work, we improve the concrete communication complexity by combining some commitments in JKPT12 together. The proofs of linear relation and multiplicative relation are shortened by (6Î± + 4)â„“ and (42Î±+28)â„“ respectively, where â„“ is the size of LPN secret. As a result, the communication cost of the protocol proving arbitrary relation is reduced by a constant level.}

	abstract = {The SM4 block cipher is Chinese domestic cryptography widely used to secure data confidentiality. Its performance is a key indicator in measuring the efficiency of encryption and decryption in large-scale data scenarios. In traditional tower field optimization, the paired forward and backward linear filed transformations are sandwiched between S-boxes and L-boxes for every round of the encryption operation, which introduces heavily burdensome computation times and complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel isomorphic design for the SM4 round function, where all operations are remaining in the tower filed through multiple rounds, and the paired forward and backward field transformations in each round can be omitted. Based on the isomorphic design, we introduce a more flexible fine-grained bitsliced scheme for the SM4 block cipher with the SIMD instructions, requiring only 32 independent data blocks to be processed in parallel. The experiments show that the proposed isomorphic design for the round function is superior to the traditional design, and the fine-grained bitsliced SM4 implementation on the server device and terminal device achieved 6.4 and 17.2 cycles per byte respectively, showing a performance increase of 284.3% and 54.4% compared to OpenSSL implementation(24.7 and 26.6 cycles per byte respectively).}

However, a large number of security issues have affected its further development. Existing schemes use identity-based restricted partial blind signature technique to implement authentication schemes with high computational cost. Local aggregators suffer from tampering with transaction records. Malicious EVs continuously listen to power transactions to infer the lifestyle of EV users. This scheme designs a cloud-edge collaboration authentication scheme based on V2G short randomizable signature. Specifically, privacy during EV power transactions is guaranteed using lightweight cryptographic primitives. EVs evaluate the reputation value of local aggregators through additive secret sharing. Cloud computing center and edge servers are capable of collaborative authentication and collaborative tracking. This scheme can improve the authentication efficiency of V2G network.}

Most existing approches for TOR network de-anonymization heavily rely on manually extracted features resulting in time consuming and poor performance. To tackle the shortcomings, this paper proposes a neural representation learning approach to recognize website fingerprint based on classification algorithm. We constructed a new website fingerprinting attack model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with dilation and causal convolution, which can improve the perception field of CNN as well as capture the sequential characteristic of input data. Experiments on three mainstream public datasets show that the proposed model is robust and effective for the website fingerprint classification and improves the accuracy by 12.21% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

Firstly, noise samples, feature distributions, high-dimensional features, and category imbalance of multi-source sample sets were processed to obtain cleaned samples. Then, the category perception and perception coefficients of the cleaned samples were calculated to obtain the category perception product, and the defect risk identification (DRI) model was constructed by the category perception product. Finally, the risk identification probabilities were calculated using the DRI model to identify potential risks. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs well with accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The obtained risk identification probabilities and defect risk levels are consistent with the actual situation of real samples, which can accurately reflect the severity of defects and identify potential risks.}

	abstract = {As the enterprise networks are being constantly targeted by sophisticated cyber threats, Zero Trust Security has been suggested to address existing threats. Zero Trust Security models have been recently proposed for outsourcing network security monitoring to third-party analysts. Therefore, the current trends of security monitoring needs to shift to "Never Trust, Always Verify". There are no concerns about analysis accuracy, if a zero trust model is resistant against security attacks. In this paper, a modified multi-view approach is proposed to preserve privacy in network traces, emphasizing the challenges needed to be tackled. We then extend the multi-view approach for the features that are not in the known list of the analyzer and extend the partitioning methods to a more balanced approach. In addition, in order to send any data to the analyzer, we propose to use an Auto-Encoder Convolutional Neural Network, which has the ability to receive any type of input attributes for detecting intrusive behavior. Our proposed multi-view approach outperforms existing works and improves efficiency by improving indistinguishability and preserving privacy for any attributes. The proposed Intrusion Detection System also outperforms existing works by up to 1% higher accuracy without any need for feature engineering.}

	abstract = {Aiming at the fact that the existing source code vulnerability detection methods did not explicitly maintain the semantic information related to the vulnerability in the source code, which made it difficult for the vulnerability detection model to extract the vulnerability sentence features and had a high detection false positive rate, a source code vulnerability detection method based on the vulnerability dependency graph is proposed. Firstly, the candidate vulnerability sentences of the function were matched, and the vulnerability dependency representation graph corresponding to the function was generated by analyzing the multi-layer control dependencies and data dependencies of the candidate vulnerability sentences. Secondly, abstracted the function name and variable name of the code sentences node and generated the initial representation vector of the code sentence nodes in the vulnerability dependency representation graph. Finally, the source code vulnerability detection model based on the heterogeneous graph transformer was used to learn the context information of the code sentence nodes in the vulnerability dependency representation graph. In this paper, the proposed method was verified on three datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method have better performance in source code vulnerability detection, and the recall rate is increased by 1.50%~22.27%, and the F1 score is increased by 1.86%~16.69%, which is better than the existing methods.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers resource-constrained users big-volume data storage and energy-consuming complicated computation. However, owing to the lack of full trust in the cloud, the cloud users prefer privacy-preserving data computation with correctness verification. However, cryptography-based schemes introduce high computational costs to both the cloud and its users for verifiable computation with privacy preservation, which makes it difficult to support complicated computations in practice. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) as a trusted execution environment is widely researched in various fields, and is regarded as a promising way to achieve efficient outsourced data computation with privacy preservation over the cloud. But we find two types of threats towards the computation with SGX: Disarranging Data-Related Code threat and Output Tampering and Misrouting threat. In this paper, we depict these threats using formal methods and propose an efficient and secure scheme to resist the threats and realize verifiable computation for Intel SGX. We prove the security and show the efficiency and correctness of our proposed scheme through theoretic analysis and extensive experiments. Furthermore, we compare our scheme with some cryptography-based schemes to show its high efficiency.}

	abstract = {Traditional Web application category recognition is implemented by fingerprint rule matching, which is difficult to extract fingerprint rules and has limited coverage. At present, many improved identification methods semi-automatically extract fingerprints through certain rules and identify Web application categories through clustering or classification algorithms, but still rely on fingerprint rules and human intervention, and the time complexity of classification is too high to process a large amount of data. This paper proposes Multi-layer Simhash Algorithm and combines DBSCAN clustering to realize intelligent identification of Web application types, pioneering the complete automation of fingerprint identification of Web applications. This method has the function of discovering unknown Web applications and predicting unknown application types, and solves the problems of fingerprint rule extraction and manual dependence of Web applications. This paper through the TF-IDF algorithm to extract the Web page text key words and weight, Then, Multi-layer Simhash Algorithm is used to transform text feature words and weights into binary characteristic hash value, at last, the hamming distance between the input Web page and the characteristic hash value of the known category is compared with the radius of the base class, which determines the category of the input Web application. The experimental results show that the accuracy of Web application category recognition and prediction is more than 97% and 93% respectively.}

	abstract = {Air-gapped systems are isolated from the Internet due to the sensitive information they handle.This paper presents a new covert channel attack that enables the leaking of sensitive information from highly isolated, air-gapped systems to nearby mobile phones. Malware running on an air-gapped computer can generate radio waves by executing crafted code on the target system. The malicious code exploits the dynamic power consumption of modern computers and manipulates the momentary loads on CPU cores. With this technique, malware can control the computer's internal utilization and generate low-frequency electromagnetic radiation in the 0-60 kHz band. Sensitive information (e.g., files, encryption keys, biometric data, and keylogging) can be modulated over the emanated signals and received by a nearby mobile phone at a max speed of 1000 bit/sec. We show that a standard smartphone with a simple antenna carried by a malicious insider or visitor can be used as a covert receiver. Finally, we present a set of countermeasures to this air-gap attack.}

	abstract = {Medical data sharing can improve the quality of medical care and promote progress in the field of public health. However, medical data has high confidentiality and complexity. Taking the clinical diagnosis and treatment data of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (T2DM) in medical treatment as an example, T2DM data often has the phenomenon of "multi-disease coexistence" and is insecure and inaccurate in the process of sharing. Based on Blockchain and Attribute- Encryption (ABE), we propose a T2DM data sharing system to solve the above problems. An Attribute-Encryption algorithm T2DM-CP-ABE is proposed to solve the problem of excessive sharing granularity. T2DM-CP-ABE, combined with the medical data contribution module, takes the contribution factor as an important consideration, to stimulate the power of T2DM data sharing and promote the development of national diabetes prevention. Based on the Blockchain, a medical data attribute authorization model is proposed, which provides a credible solution for multiple hospitals to realize medical data attribute authorization, and realizes the clinical diagnosis and treatment data sharing of T2DM among doctors. Based on Blockchain and ABE technology, a data sharing system for T2DM has been implemented on the Fabric platform. The result shows that the average time for the system to complete a single sharing is less than 1 second.}

	abstract = {The phenomenon of unbalanced regional medical resources has led to large differences in the implementation experience of clinical pathways in hospitals with different medical levels. However, due to the fear of privacy leakage and the lack of sharing motivation, there is a lack of effective collaborative communication channels for clinical pathways among medical institutions. In response to these problems, we propose a blockchain-based sharing incentive scheme for clinical pathway experience, which uses the clinical pathway implementation effect evaluation system to evaluate the quality of clinical pathway experience data. Specifically, we designe a two-phase cross-domain shared transaction model for the transaction of clinical pathway experience data. Moreover, we introduce the shared transaction alliance committee to verify and review the transaction, and solve the problems in the transaction in the arbitration phase. Finally, the functional test results show that the system meets the experience sharing incentive requirements, and the performance test results show that the TPS of sharing clinical pathway experience read and writed can reach around 600 and 1000, and the transaction latency of each phase is within 3 s.}

	abstract = {Machine unlearning is a significant part of machine learning security because machine learning models are not immune to attacks such as poisoning attacks. In addition, various studies have proved that it is feasible to obtain training set information from the model, which can lead to leakage of user data privacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method to remove specific data from the model training set. Naive retraining will bring huge time and resource costs, while SISA can achieve a balance between unlearning cost and model performance to a certain extent by dividing the dataset into multiple independent shards. As forgotten data grows, the performance of SISA is still unable to meet the actual needs. In this paper, we propose a method, which dynamically selects the shards that need to be retrained. First, we divide the dataset into multiple independent shards, when the forgotten data makes multiple shards need to be retrained at the same time, our approach is to mix these affected shards together, and then train the mixed shards individually to achieve global forgetting. The simulation results show that compared with SISA, we can get more than 3Ã— speedup on different datasets, and the accuracy of the aggregation model is also improved by 0.5% and 2.1% on MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively.}

	abstract = {As the amount of data containing human genome information increases, these data will be further utilized in medicine. However, if the statistics obtained from large-scale analyses are released unchanged, there is a risk of identifying individuals. Although there are several privacy-preserving techniques to release and utilize genomic statistics, most have the problem of poor accuracy at high privacy levels and do not provide correct results especially with an increased number of outputs. In addition, existing methods with relatively high accuracy are computationally intensive and hardly applicable to a large cohort such as those containing 10 6 SNPs. In this paper, we propose innovative differentially private methods with both efficiency and high accuracy to release the top K significant SNPs based on genomic statistics data. First, we enhance the Fourier perturbation algorithm (FPA), which was proposed in the context of histogram publication, for use with genomic statistics. Then, we propose a new extended FPA with more accurate privacy guarantees and provide a proof that this method achieves Îµ-differential privacy. Furthermore, we present novel methods combining DFT with the Laplace and exponential mechanisms. These methods take only $\\mathcal{O}(m{\\text{log}}m)$ time for a dataset containing m SNPs. We also theoretically guarantee that the value of sensitivity for these methods is smaller than that for existing methods and therefore can provide more accurate outputs. In fact, our proposed algorithms can be conducted in less than 20 seconds even for a large cohort, and our experiments using real data show that our methods can achieve 1.5 to 8 times higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods especially when K is large. Because retrieving multiple significant SNPs from large cohorts in genomic analysis is preferred, our proposed methods are remarkably advisable rather than existing methods. Supplementary materials and the Python implementation of our experiments are available at https://github.com/ay0408/DP-DFT.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the leakage of personal information and privacy becomes a major concern in various fields, such as social sciences, genomics, and medicine. To combat this problem, differential privacy has been proposed and soon be widely studied and applied. Meanwhile, the compositional nature of differential privacy has motivated the design and implementation of differentially private machine learning mechanisms. However, as these mechanisms are gradually deployed in practice, a serious problem appears: they find it hard to choose a meaningful Îµ value or understand the meaning of a chosen Îµ value in practice. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient approach that would allow users to choose Îµ according to their utility or accuracy requirement. Specifically, we can efficiently obtain the expected Îµ value that would generate a private model satisfying the expected empirical loss or expected accuracy, through at least one-round training and some calculations. As product requirements often impose hard accuracy constraints, our approach allows users to focus on their own benefits without paying too much attention to things they donâ€™t understand or care. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and broad applicability of our mechanism in practical applications.}

	abstract = {Health monitoring devices are gaining popularity both as wellness tools and as a source of information for healthcare decisions. In this work, we use Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for time-series forecasting due to their proven energy-saving capabilities. Thanks to their design that closely mimics the natural nervous system, SNNs are energy-efficient in contrast to classic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). We design and implement an energy-efficient privacy-preserving forecasting system on real-world health data streams using SNNs and compare it to a state-of-the-art system with Long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model. Our evaluation shows that SNNs tradeoff accuracy (2.2Ã— greater error), to grant a smaller model (19% fewer parameters and 77% less memory consumption) and a 43% less training time. Our model is estimated to consume 3.36Î¼J energy, which is significantly less than the traditional ANNs. Finally, we apply Îµ-differential privacy for enhanced privacy guarantees on our federated learning-based models. With differential privacy of Îµ = 0.1, our experiments report an increase in the measured average error (RMSE) of only 25%.}

	abstract = {Cross-user deduplication is an effective technique means to eliminate redundant uploading in using cloud storage by returning a specific response to indicate existence of the data in request. However, the deterministic response actually provides a side channel to attackers, which could be utilized to steal existence privacy of the target data in cloud storage. Because of the difficulty to achieve complete obfuscation in response for chunk level deduplication, such kind of attack still cannot be well resisted, let alone random chunks generation attack, a more sophisticated form to assist statistical attacks. Even though dirty chunks processing is able to resist such attacks under normal circumstances, a lot of communication overhead is introduced inevitably. To deal with these challenges, we propose a marking based obfuscation strategy in cross-user deduplication for cloud storage, which takes the lead to well improve security in cross-user deduplication under side channel attack as well as random chunks generation attack. Specifically, we first calculate the number of chunks to be marked to cover at least one duplicate chunk with great probability. Then perform marking strategy to the certain number of randomly chosen chunks, to consider them as inexistent before generating a response regardless of their real existence. To achieve light weight dirty chunks processing with security guaranteed, as long as at least a dirty chunk is found to be involved in the request, once more marking is introduced to achieve another obfuscation. The experimental results show that, the proposed scheme is lightweight in achieving security comparing with the state-of-the art.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, privacy-preserving message transmission and authentication have become an indispensable part in the field of data collection and analysis. There exist many protocols based on the public key cryptosystem, which allow the users to utilize their own identity as the public key to carry out data encryption and digital signature, which is very suitable for applying in the IoT environment with a large number of terminal devices. However, these protocols usually involve some complex cryptographic operations, which hinder their application on the resource-constrained IoT devices. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving and verifiable outsourcing message transmission and authentication protocol, which allows the resource-constrained users to delegate some complex operations to the two untrusted edge servers and reduce the computational burden on the users side. The designed protocol contains several secure and novel outsourcing algorithms for modular exponentiation, bilinear pairing and scalar multiplication. For the different operations in the different situations, we design several different blinding techniques and verification methods, which not only protect the usersâ€™ private information, but also ensure the users can verify the correctness of results.

	abstract = {The encrypted deduplication can provide both storage savings and data confidentiality for cloud storage systems. Convergent encryption (CE) is a well-known solution for encrypted deduplication, but it brings huge computation and storage overheads for key management. MinHash encryption is an effective solution to this issue. It reduces the number of keys by grouping multiple consecutive chunks into segments and generating one key for each segment. However, MinHash encryption does not take full advantage of the segment similarity, which can be used to further reduce the overhead for key management. To this end, we augment MinHash encryption with Bloom filter and Locality Sensitivity Hash (LSH) to design an enhanced MinHash encryption scheme. Firstly, our scheme generates a sketch for each segment based on the Bloom filter, and projects sketches to the points in a hash table through LSH functions. Secondly, we detect the segment similarity by the distance between points, and similar segments are grouped into super-segments. Finally, we combine MinHash encryption and server-aided message-locked encryption to encrypt the super-segments for achieving encrypted deduplication. We conduct trace-driven experiments using a realworld dataset. Compared with MinHash encryption, our scheme has higher storage efficiency and better encryption performance.}

	abstract = {Authentication, authorization, and trust verification are central parts of an access control system. The conditions for granting access in such a system are collected in access policies. Since access conditions are often complex, dedicated languages â€“ policy languages â€“ for defining policies are in use.However, current policy languages are unable to express such conditions having privacy of users in mind. With privacy-preserving technologies, users are enabled to prove information to the access system without revealing it.In this work, we present a generic design for supporting privacy-preserving technologies in policy languages. Our design prevents unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information while still allowing the formulation of expressive rules for access control. For that we make use of zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs). We demonstrate our design by applying it to the TPL policy language, while using SNARKs. Also, we evaluate the resulting ZK-TPL language and its associated toolchain. Our evaluation shows that for regular-sized credentials communication and verification overhead is negligible.}

	abstract = {Verifiable secure aggregation (VSA) is a critical procedure in federated learning (FL), where secure aggregation achieves local gradients aggregation while data confidentiality is preserved, and verifiability enables participants to verify the correctness of aggregated results returned by a central server (CS). Most of existing solutions for VSA employ cumbersome cryptographic primitives and techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption, bilinear pairing, interactive proof systems), which impose high communication round complexity and computational costs on participants or CS. Besides, user dropouts occur commonly in cross-device FL as a result of unstable network connection, it is demanded to design particular mechanism to deal with such events. In this paper, we present a robust secure aggregation scheme with lightweight verification for FL, by utilizing Shamirâ€™s secret sharing technique to design a random masking code to protect the confidentiality of local gradients and achieve resilience to possible user dropout. To support verifiability upon aggregation, we extend a multi-key homomorphic MAC to achieve verification over gradient vector space. We provide security analysis to show that our scheme can protect data confidentiality against collusion attacks, meanwhile ensure the verifiable results are unforgeable under the assumption pseudorandom functions exist. We implement our scheme to verify its correctness and feasibility, performance evaluation shows its advantages in terms of efficiency and functionality.}

	abstract = {As people enjoy the personalized services recommended by Recommender Systems (RSs), the privacy disclosure risk increases with frequent interactions. Malicious adversary often collects public information online to infer private information for illicit profit. As privacy concerns grew, researchers introduced data obfuscation into recommender systems. However, there still exists several limitations in current work. First, although the existing methods effectively reduce the risk of privacy disclosure, they can be detrimental to the quality of the recommendation service. Second, a range of practical issues under the application of recommendation systems are not considered, e.g., long-tail, density, etc. To address those challenges, we propose a novel framework named Want User Defending Inference (WUDI), a high-performance privacy-preserving debiased framework based on data obfuscation. Unlike the original strategies, i.e., adding or removing user ratings, we introduced some novel strategies to generate an obfuscated matrix. Firstly, we define a new method called Cluster Recommend for alleviating the long-tail skewness and data sparsity in RSs. Then we investigate the gender bias in obfuscation and apply a bias mitigating strategy to RSs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that WUDI can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in obfuscation.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has attracted significant interest, as it provides a distributed machine learning paradigm to share data resources during model training process. However, sharing the gradients or model weights uploaded by clients or the final model aggregated by the server can lead to privacy disclosures and executing correctness issues. Specifically, the original data can be easily inferred through analyzing the shared gradients, and malicious users can disrupt the model aggregation to result in a destruction of the model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel FL scheme with providing both privacy protection and robust aggregation. By using the distributed differential privacy and range proof technologies, the proposed scheme resists semi-honest servers and malicious users, while protecting the global model and providing the high accuracy. Both privacy analysis and experiments are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.}

The multi-stage Saab transform and Channel-wise Saab transform extract low-level to high-level data features for successive subspace learning, but the feature extraction process has some privacy security issues that hinder its further development.

	abstract = {Multidimensional mean estimation with local differential privacy (LDP) extracts the numerical features from groups while protecting usersâ€™ personal information without relying on a trusted server. However, the increase of dimensionality would lead to a deficiency in the allocable privacy budget, resulting in excessive accuracy loss. To solve this problem, we propose HyperMean, an effective privacy-preserving mean estimation mechanism for multidimensional data whose accuracy is at least no worse (and better in most cases) than existing solutions. We first design a multidimensional staircase function to obfuscate usersâ€™ data, significantly reducing the output variance. Second, an adaptive dimensionality reduction is performed on usersâ€™ data to allocate the privacy budget to some focused dimensions. Finally, the server averages all usersâ€™ obfuscated outputs to obtain an unbiased estimate of the mean results. Theoretical analysis reveals that HyperMean effectively reduces the worst-case variance of multidimensional mean estimation under LDP while maintaining low computational complexity. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that HyperMean outperforms existing multidimensional mean estimation mechanisms in terms of aggregated error.}

	abstract = {Voiceprint authentication is a promising approach for user authentication due to its low acquisition cost and non-contact characteristics. However, most of existing voiceprint authentication systems directly store user voiceprint templates in a database, without taking any effective measures to protect user privacy. Once the voiceprint templates in the database are leaked, user voice information becomes public, which brings severe security threats to the users and impact practical applications of a voiceprint authentication system. Few literature works study privacy-preserving voiceprint authentication although it is particularly needed. Most of existing solutions based on cryptography suffer from high computational costs. But usability of some efficient systems is poor due to additional interactions with users. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes VoiceSketch, a privacy-preserving voiceprint authentication system based on a secure sketch to protect the privacy of user voiceprint templates with high usability. VoiceSketch does not store the voiceprint templates directly. Instead, it uses a secure sketch to correct errors between multiple voiceprint features of the same user and use cryptographic hash function to extract an authentication key from a userâ€™s voiceprint template. We analyze the security of VoiceSketch based on secure sketch and hash function. We also implement VoiceSketch and design a series of experiments to verify its accuracy and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP) has attracted considerable attention due to its privacy-preserving capability against inference-type attacks, e.g., model inversion attacks and membership inference attacks. However, the noise introduced by LDP reduces the global model performance, while decreasing the noise by setting a larger privacy budget sacrifices the privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose a layer-wise LDP for the FL system, dubbed LLDP, which disturbs various layers of a local model according to clientsâ€™ self-assigned privacy budgets. With the deployment of LLDP, clients could train a highly accurate and rapid-converged global model without loosing privacy guarantees. Through extensive security analyses, the proposed LLDP scheme helps the entire local model achieve (Îµ,Î´)-LDP, and the probability indistinguishability of the local model is achieved under the widespread semi-honest threat model. Ingenious experiments show that LLDP improves the global model prediction and convergence rate by 3.38% and 4.76% on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art LDP method with the same privacy budget. In addition, given the same training target (loss value), LLDP requires a 26.67% lower privacy budget, providing stronger privacy guarantees against model inversion attacks.}

	abstract = {Regrettable disclosures (i.e., things people wish they had not posted/shared) on social media platforms have become a serious issue in recent years. When engaged in self-presentation and impression management on online social networks (OSN), users often make disclosures that they subsequently regret. Such regrets have been shown to typically revolve around disclosures on sensitive topics or sharing content with strong sentiment, lies, and secrets. As such, regrettable self-disclosures do not only jeopardize peoplesâ€™ privacy but are also damaging to their public reputation and private relationships. In this work, we present WallGuard, a system for nudging OSN users towards detecting and avoiding embarrassing, privacy sensitive and regrettable online disclosures. WallGuardâ€™s key building block is a hierarchical machine learning framework which provides mechanisms to predict regret-specific labels associated with any given user-generated text. To achieve this goal, we designed and experimented with new deep learning models and propose Regret Embeddings. The latter are domain-specific pre-trained word embeddings for regrettable disclosures. Extensive evaluations of the proposed models demonstrate their high classification performances (with a weighted AUC score of up to 0.975) on a real-world corpus of annotated regrettable user-generated texts. WallGuard allows OSN users to specify individual preferences with respect to the types of topical content to be shared with specific audiences. Therefore, while content analysis is done in an objective manner, nudgy personalized disclosure recommendations are generated based on userâ€™s privacy preferences. A proof-of-concept of our tool is available, currently as a Facebook thirdparty app yet easily deployable on other social media platforms.}

	abstract = {Federated learning seeks to address the issue of isolated data islands by making clients disclose only their local training models. However, it was demonstrated that private information could still be inferred by analyzing local model parameters, such as deep neural network model weights. Recently, differential privacy has been applied to federated learning to protect data privacy, but the noise added may degrade the learning performance much. Typically, in previous work, training parameters were clipped equally and noises were added uniformly. The heterogeneity and convergence of training parameters were simply not considered. In this paper, we propose a differentially private scheme for federated learning with adaptive noise (Adap DP-FL). Specifically, due to the gradient heterogeneity, we conduct adaptive gradient clipping for different clients and different rounds; due to the gradient convergence, we add decreasing noises accordingly. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our Adap DP-FL outperforms previous methods significantly.}

	abstract = {Smart locks are one of the most popular Internet of things devices, which help ease the burden of physical key management in smart home, hotel, and especially in short-term rental house markets. Existing smart lock systems either suffer from the state consistency attacks that allow unauthorized access, or rely on a remote server to maintain an access list, which could be altered by compromised servers. Moreover, privacy risks could be posed to the guests when they reserve a property by the rental platform, which is usually integrated with the smart lock system. To address the above issues, we propose a smart lock system that provides security and privacy guarantees in IoT-enabled rental house markets. The proposed system resists state consistency attacks by utilizing a one-way hash chain to replace the access list. Meanwhile, we take advantage of dynamic accumulators and signature of knowledge to realize user authentication and privacy protection of the guests. Finally, we make a theoretical security and privacy analysis of the proposed system, and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance to show the efficiency of the proposed system.}

We consider that data protection mechanisms must intervene upstream as recommended by the principles of privacy by design. Our view is that database management systems should be equipped with anonymization mechanisms. By relying on a partitioned data storage scheme, support for data update operations and query rewriting, our approach offers a trade-off between data privacy and utility. Some advantages of our approach are a low overhead of storing partitioned data, the performance of CRUD operations and the efficiency of a batch delivery approach to data updates. We evaluate our prototype on an open source RDF store and on synthetic datasets.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) algorithm provides an efficient distributed training paradigm. Existing FL frameworks still suffer from privacy leakage hazards such as membership inference attacks. The current popular defense approaches are mainly based on differential privacy (DP) strategy. However, privacy preservation is undertaken with an inevitable loss of model utility in DP. As a result, it performs miserably in practical deployments. To solve this problem, we modify the FL framework through the information bottleneck (IB) method to attain a trade-off between privacy protection and model utility. Firstly, we adapt the training process on client side by applying IB in the local training. It is intended to squeeze out privacy through the bottleneck. Secondly, we further modify the training process on server side. A validation process is used to evaluate whether the IB-based local training is squeezing out privacy. Clients that extrude the right information will occupy an important place in aggregation phase. Extensive experiments on classic datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of privacy preservation and model utility.}

FLightNER allows the aggregation of only the trainable parameters of LightNER without model accuracy degradation saving 10 GB per client enabling more clients to join a federation without extending the central serverâ€™s memory. We evaluate our approach against two baselines using three diverse datasets with different distributions across up to seven clients in a federation. We empirically show that compared to the centrally-trained LightNER model, FLightNER outperforms it by 19% when performed on a medical dataset with label imbalance across clients and matches it when performed on two balanced datasets: CoNLL and I2B2. Furthermore, we use and evaluate two well-established memory-saving techniques: AdaFactor optimizer and Automatic Mixed Precision on our FL approach. Our findings enable owners of sensitive data such as healthcare practitioners to efficiently train an NER model collaboratively, with low memory requirements, while keeping their data on-premise.}

	abstract = {Privacy protection in the era of big data has attracted attention, and privacy leakage may cause severe user losses. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that stores data locally in participating nodes. FL is an effective way to protect data privacy under the current background of artificial intelligence. Blockchain is a distributed data structure with the advantages of decentralization, non-tampering, and non-counterfeiting. Traditional FL relies on centralized servers and is prone to the single point of failure, and the problem can be avoided by replacing the centralized server with blockchain technology. However, unauthorized participants may launch poison attacks, and untrusted nodes in the blockchain send faulty aggregation models to users, reducing the modelâ€™s availability. Given the above problems, this paper proposes an FL (DS-AVFL) framework with authentication and verification. Blockchain technology is used for dynamic identity management, only updates uploaded by authenticated local devices can be added to the blockchain, and local devices can verify the received global model. Experimental results show that the scheme is feasible and has reasonable computing costs.}

	abstract = {Ridge regression is an important statistical method that is widely used in real life, such as health prediction. As clients with limited computing resources may not be able to handle large training datasets, it is necessary to outsource this operation to a powerful cloud server. Data privacy is raised due to outsourcing. Some previous works on secure outsourcing ridge regression were provided for privacy preserving. However, there are some issues such as having heavy workloads and inefficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving protocol for outsourcing ridge regression. In our design, we utilize blinding technology to protect the privacy of clients by transforming the original problem into an encryption problem with orthogonal and diagonal matrices as the secret keys. The following advantages can be seen from the experimental result and theoretical analysis: (1) Our protocol is more efficient than related works. When the calculation dimension is greater than 6000Ã—1500, clients computations greatly reduce to 60 percent of other schemes and the total computing is close to the original calculation; (2) Edge server provides the public verifiability, which allows any verifier to verify whether the result returned by the cloud server is correct; (3) We also give a formal proof of security based on the standard simulation model.}

	abstract = {With the spread of IoT devices, various data about our lives are being collected, such as heart rate, physical activity, number of steps, pulse, oxygen intake, calorie consumption, etc. If these data can be analyzed, it will be possible to learn the signs of disease. However, it is dangerous for a personâ€™s activity status to be managed on an external server with the view of privacy. To solve this problem, local differential privacy (LDP), which is a technique for randomly adding local noise to data, has been proposed. While ensuring privacy by LDP is certainly important, it degrades the usefulness of the analysis of data with added noise. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to protect data privacy in both phases of training and testing based on LDP. We also make sure feasibility of our mechanism in two cases of breast cancer screening data and ionosphere data set.}

	abstract = {With the development of location-based services, spatio-textual similarity join has attracted much research attention from academic and industrial communities following the study of spatio-textual data processing. To offload the computation and storage burden of spatio-textual similarity join, outsourcing the data processing and storage to the public cloud can achieve great cost savings, however, may cause serious privacy concerns. To this end, in this paper, we first define and solve the privacy-preserving spatio-textual similarity join problem and propose two novel secure similarity join schemes. As the baseline, we first present a straightforward scheme applying Asymmetric Inner Product Encryption (AIPE) to facilitate the data encryption and similarity calculation in ciphertext. To improve the efficiency of the basic scheme, we further propose an optimized secure top-k spatio-textual similarity join scheme by constructing a secure index based on the hybrid Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Through matching the encrypted hash values over the secure index to narrow down the candidates, the similarity join results can be efficiently retrieved from the candidate pairs. Comprehensive analysis of the proposed schemes is provided in terms of computational complexity and security guarantees, and extensive experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show the performance of our schemes.}

Based on the designed security protocols, we propose a secure decision-making protocol in cloud computing, which enables the cloud server to perform element selection and Q-learning functions on ciphertext data. During the entire process, the cloud server does not need to know the actual state, thus guaranteeing the security of the original state information. We analyze the security and complexity of the whole scheme theoretically. Our experimental results show our proposed schemeâ€™s effectiveness and good spatio-temporal performance.}

	abstract = {Video Frame-Rate Up-Conversion (FRUC) is originally designed to produce the high frame-rate video by periodically inserting new frames between two adjacent frames. However, it can also be utilized to synthesize the faked high frame-rate videos or spliced videos for malicious intents. The existing FRUC detection methods can efficiently identify its occurrence by exploring the blurring effects or deformed structures left over from the traditional FRUC methods. But the video FRUC has been substantially improved in the past years, especially in this deep learning era. Deep learning-based video FRUC (Deep FRUC) weakens the visual traces of the traditional ones such that it is challenging for the current FRUC detectors. In this paper, we propose a forensics algorithm based on dual-stream multi-scale spatial-temporal representation for Deep FRUC. Specifically, we develop a multi-scale receptive field strategy, and attention scheme to learn hidden tampered trace and spatial-temporal representation, respectively. Besides, frame residual and noise residual attention streams are complementary learning from the spatial-temporal dimension, in which the former can capture contrast differences and tampered abnormal boundaries, while the latter can explode noise inconsistencies between original and tampered frames. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve the best detection accuracy compared with the existing FRUC forensics works under the Deep FRUC video datasets.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are typically sophisticated, stealthy and long-term attacks that are difficult to be detected and investigated. Recently proposed provenance graph based on system audit logs has become an important approach for APT detection and investigation. However, existing provenance-based approaches that either require rules based on expert knowledge or cannot pinpoint attack events in a provenance graph still cannot effectively mitigate APT attacks. In this paper, we present Deepro, a provenance-based APT campaign detection approach that not only effectively detects attack-relevant entities in a provenance graph but also precisely recovers APT campaigns based on the detected entities. Specifically, Deepro first customizes a general purpose GNN (Graph Neural Network) model to represent and detect process nodes in a provenance graph through automatically learning different patterns of attack behaviors and benign behaviors using the rich contextual information in the provenance graph. Then, Deepro further detects attack-relevant file and network entities according to their data dependencies with the detected process nodes. Finally, Deepro recovers APT campaigns through correlating detected entities based on their causality relationships in the provenance graph. We evaluated Deepro with ten real-world APT attacks. The evaluation result shows that Deepro can effectively detect attack events with an average 98.81% F 1 -score and thus produces precise provenance sub-graphs of APT attacks.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant performance in many applications (e.g., social spammer detection and Facebook page classification). Recently, backdoor attacks pose a new security threat to the training process of GNNs. Attackers intend to inject backdoors into GNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be changed to target label when the trigger is present. However, existing works on backdoor attacks could not attack arbitrary nodes effectively and achieve high performance on both nodes with discrete features and that with continuous features. In this paper, we propose a general backdoor attack to GNNs which could effectively attack arbitrary nodes while keeping other nodes unaffected as much as possible. We first ensure some important edges for a target node by utilizing edge explanation method and remove these edges if the edge exists before (vice versa). Then we ensure important features by using feature explanation method and use a neural network to optimize these features to obtain feature triggers (i.e., perturbation). Finally, we inject edge and feature triggers into target nodes to implement attack. We evaluate our attack from two aspects including generality and effectiveness. For the first part, our attack is effective on both datasets with discrete features and continuous features. For the second part, we randomly select different node subset with different size (e.g., 20, 50, 100 nodes) as target nodes and our attack achieves higher performance against other two state-of-the-art attacks.}

	abstract = {To discover and defend against APT attacks more efficiently, we need to conduct binary analysis and source tracing research on APT malicious codes. This paper attributes APT groups for malicious codes from the perspective of binary similarity. First, we innovatively select the local features of the binary functions for classification and apply time series mining techniques to the mining of sequences of basic blocks (called paths). The Shapelet model selects path shapelets, which are path fragments that can best represent paths and are used to distinguish paths. Path shapelets can provide path-level interpretability for classification. Second, we use API calls to filter functions and generate paths of interest to reduce resource consumption. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect APT malicious codes based on publicly available threat intelligence reports. Our method filters 92.82% of functions and generates an average of 1.37 paths per function. The classification effect has obvious advantages over other methods.}

	abstract = {New malware increasingly adopts novel fileless techniques to evade detection from antivirus programs. Process injection is one of the most popular fileless attack techniques. This technique makes malware more stealthy by writing malicious code into memory space and reusing the name and port of the host process. It is difficult for traditional security software to detect and intercept process injections due to the stealthiness of its behavior. We propose a novel framework called ProcGuard for detecting process injection behaviors. This framework collects sensitive function call information of typical process injection. Then we perform a fine-grained analysis of process injection behavior based on the function call chain characteristics of the program, and we also use the improved RCNN network to enhance API analysis on the tampered memory segments. We combine API analysis with deep learning to determine whether a process injection attack has been executed. We collect a large number of malicious samples with process injection behavior and construct a dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of ProcGuard. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves an accuracy of 81.58% with a lower false-positive rate compared to other systems. In addition, we also evaluate the detection time and runtime performance loss metrics of ProcGuard, both of which are improved compared to previous detection tools.}

	abstract = {Persuasion, which is the act of convincing someone to change their idea, attitude, or opinion, happens anywhere and anytime in social life. In this paper, based on the social judgment theory, we propose a novel asynchronous evolution Deffuant-Weisbuch opinion dynamics model by introducing the latitude of non-commitment. In our model, when agents communicate with each other, the evolution of their opinions depend not only on the opinion of themselves and their neighbors but also on the latitude where they locate, thus an opinion evolution rule that close to reality is designed. The model can well explain the persuasion process and captures the assimilation phenomenon in social networks. Simulation results show that the model can finally reach a stable state. Moreover, network topology, initial distribution of agentsâ€™ opinions and the range of latitudes of non-commitment all have an impact on the convergence time of opinions.}

In this work, we focus on increasing accessibility to the audio DeepFake detection methods by providing SpecRNet, a neural network architecture characterized by a quick inference time and low computational requirements. Our benchmark shows that SpecRNet, requiring up to about 40% less time to process an audio sample, provides performance comparable to LCNN architecture â€” one of the best audio DeepFake detection models. Such a method can not only be used by online multimedia services to verify a large bulk of content uploaded daily but also, thanks to its low requirements, by average citizens to evaluate materials on their devices. In addition, we provide benchmarks in three unique settings that confirm the correctness of our model. They reflect scenarios of lowâ€“resource datasets, detection on short utterances and limited attacks benchmark in which we take a closer look at the influence of particular attacks on given architectures.}

	abstract = {Software Side Channel Vulnerabilities (SSCVs) cause serious security threats, which introduces a big challenge to software development. With the sustaining growth of software complexity and scale, SSCV detection has become a tedious work. Existing methods suffer from efficiency, accuracy and generality problems, and ignore the detection of vulnerability variants. Applying machine learning is promising due to high efficiency and automation, but training an effective model is still an open issue due to the lack of side-channel vulnerability data. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage SSCV detection method based on similarity calculation and deep learning. We target three types of vulnerability variants that have different degrees of similarity to original ones. The first detection stage applies Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Trie tree to regularize software codes for detecting vulnerability Variants 1 and 2 through similarity calculation. The second stage uses Long Short-Term Memory and Neural Network Classifier (LSTM-NNClassifier) to discover vulnerability Variant 3. In addition, we offer a code augmentation method to construct a sufficient dataset to train the LSTM-NNClassifier for overcoming the problem of lacking training data. Extensive experiments based on real world data show the efficiency and accuracy of our detection method.}

	abstract = {Digital documents, as a twin of hard copy, are increasingly being used as credible evidence. Unfortunately, digital document images easily suffer forgery or malicious manipulation, with the availability of sophisticated image editing tools. To verify and detect the possible forgeries for a given document, a number of forensic schemes have been developed. However, in the real-world scenario, the doctored image could be further processed or transmitted over a channel with unknown distortion, which dramatically degrade the forgery detection performance. In this work, we make the first step towards designing a robust document image forgery localization against image blending. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder neural network architecture consisting of three modules. The first module is responsible for capturing the multi-scale features from the high-level feature maps, and the remaining two attention-based modules aim to extract low-level local features and high-level global features. For training the model, we construct a dedicated forgery document database processed by several recent image blending procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in detecting the forgery that undergoes image blending. The source code, models and the constructed image dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwp0201/Image-Forgery-Localization-Against-Image-Blending.}

	abstract = {Money laundering is a significant problem in the financial system and provides the conditions for financing various crimes. Previous methods apply many flexible algorithms, such as machine learning, graph mining, and anomaly detection. However, most of these contemporary methods do not adequately consider the dynamic characteristics of transactions, which may contain discriminative information for money laundering detection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a dynamic transaction pattern aggregation neural network (DTPAN) for money laundering detection. DTPAN utilizes two feature extractors to learn the dynamic features of transaction behaviors and the evolution of transfer relationships between accounts. Furthermore, it employs a feature enhancement module to enhance the behavior dynamic features, capturing the latent dependency between behavior dynamic and relationship evolution. Experimental results obtained with a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DTPAN. The results also reveal that DTPAN can enhance the performance of ML detection by adequately exploring the dynamic information of transactions.}

	abstract = {Computer vision-based license plate recognition (LPR) has been widely deployed for automatic vehicle identity inspection due to the offered convenience and efficiency. However, the practical LPR systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may lead to incorrect recognition and impact the safety of transportation. Previous studies of attacking strategies targeting LPR systems mainly focused on evasion attacks, which are less efficient than model poisoning attacks that can cause mis-classification through directly manipulating the parameters of the victim model other than perturbing each testing sample. To fill this gap, we conduct the first systematic study on the vulnerability of LPR systems against model poisoning attacks. In specific, we aim to compromise the integrity of the model training such that the attacked LPR system would mis-classify all the samples from the victim class to the attacker-chosen class. To achieve this, we fine-tune the feature extractor layers of the LPR model such that it can obtain similar feature representations given samples belong to victim and attacker-chosen classes. This is implemented in a generator-discriminator fashion, where a discriminator learns to classify the victim and attacker-chosen classes given the input samples. Subsequently, the feature extractor is fine-tuned to generate manipulated features that can confuse the discriminator. Our empirical results on the CCPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy can substantially compromise LPR systems with high success rates.}

	abstract = {Immutability is an important property of blockchain which ensures integrity and prevents forgery modification of previous transactions. However, immutability also prohibits the possibility of amending outdated codes and correcting typography or fraudulent data, both of which are common needs in many use cases. Therefore, a tradeoff that keeps the integrity guarantee but lifts the strict limitation of immutability is necessary to allow the practical applications of blockchain in areas other than cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called Smarkchain, which will enhance blockchain technology with the features of amendment and correction by incorporating smart markers, an approach which enables multiway branching and merging in blockchain. Smarkchain has the unique advantages of allowing multiple consecutive blocks to be amended or corrected at one time, allowing multiple amendments or corrections over the same blocks, and not needing to modify existing blocks. Evaluation results of a prototype implementation show that our approach is practical.}

	abstract = {As a popular IoT device, home security cameras (HSCs) generate large amounts of traffic, but the security mechanisms are weak, making them often exploited to launch DDoS attacks. Moreover, the lurking HSC device significantly threatens user privacy, so it is necessary to detect the HSC traffic. With the current service upgrade of HSC devices and the popularity of the open-source DIY community, the HSC types have become numerous. However, current traffic classification methods can only rely on complex feature extraction, expertise, and static datasets for identification, making it challenging to detect unknown devices in the open world. To solve this problem, we propose an autonomous update framework, called CATD-HSC, to constantly improve the classifierâ€™s detection ability on unknown HSC devices. First, we use a CNN-based classifier model to train known HSC traffic. Then, we collect the classifierâ€™s output as a new feature and use the threshold filtering approach to filter the unknown HSC traffic. Finally, we cluster the unknown HSC traffic by connecting the original feature to the generated feature. Moreover, we make the process autonomous to reduce the repeated trivial training. We evaluate the performance of CATD-HSC on both the UNSW open dataset and the real-world HSC traces. The updated model achieves an average accuracy rate of 99.3% and a recall rate of 99.4% for unknown HSC traffic in three interference environments. Our further evaluation shows that CATD-HSC can successfully implement the classifierâ€™s autonomous update and dynamic classification on unknown HSC devices.}

	abstract = {Under the premise of ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain, the editable blockchain realizes the correction operation of the data on the chain, but the number of edits is not limited, so that malicious users can modify the data on the chain infinitely in the case of obtaining a trapdoor. Based on this, a function construction scheme that combines the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem difficulty assumption with a cryptographic primitive called one-time chameleon hash function is proposed.A controllable variable is introduced for the hash generation part of the chameleon hash function, so that the same hash value can find two preimages without revealing trapdoor information, However, when searching for the third pre-image, the secondary use of the set controllable variable results in "access failure", i.e., satisfying the secondary collision resistance, The security of the scheme under the assumption of Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem is proved in the random oracle model, and a chameleon hash algorithm that is also resistant to secondary editing is selected for experimental comparative analysis. The results show that the scheme in this paper reduces the number of modal operations, which makes the algorithm complexity reduced. It is able to improve the computing efficiency of hash generation algorithm and hash collision algorithm significantly with the same security strength. The combination of the amendment privilege restriction of the chameleon hash function and the efficiency of its algorithm is realized, which provides a technical reference for the amendment privilege management of editable blockchain.}

	abstract = {In cloud computing circumstance, users upload data to the cloud server and verify data integrity through a third-party audit (TPA). However, verifying data integrity is still a computationally intensive and time-consuming operation. If there are illegal users or unreliable cloud servers, it can only be known from the verification result, resulting in invalid computation and time overhead. In order to solve the above problems, RSA algorithm is used to verify the legitimacy of the user, and when the verification passes, Merkle hash tree is used to filter unreliable servers. To prevent replay attacks, data integrity is verified through the bilinear mapping feature. Finally, the simulation results show that the scheme not only can detect the legitimacy of users, but also filter out unreliable servers, and effectively reduce the computational and time overhead of verifying data integrity.}

	abstract = {Difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) is critical for PoW blockchain systems in currency issuance, transaction throughput, and blockchain security. Most DAAs concentrate on the unique goal of block-making stability from seconds to minutes. In contrast, we propose a new DAA with the goal of stabilizing orphan rates among the blocks made recently, observing that the orphan rate is more indicative since too high orphan rate indicates poor blockchain security and waste of honest hash power whereas too low orphan rate indicates poor blockchain throughout and wast of time awaiting other blocks. We notice a security defect of the recent orphan-rate DAA (NDSS 2022) in which an attacker may continually create orphan blocks and mislead miners to wrongly increase the difficulty. To fix this defect, our enhanced DAA takes into the orphan rate variation during the historical slots with smooth exponential decay affection on current difficulty adjustment. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that our DAA is effective and secure.}

	abstract = {Since the message encoding in lattice-based schemes is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, a first-order masked message encoder has been proposed and applied to multiple masked implementations. However, the security of the masked encoder still lacks enough evaluation. In this paper, we investigate the security of the masked message encoder in a masked Kyber implementation. First, we give a detailed side-channel leakage analysis of the masked implementation in a specific platform, and we explain the technical challenges of designing a key recovery attack for the masked implementations. Even so, we still found a new 2-stage key recovery attack, which overcomes the difficulties and can recover the whole private key of the masked Kyber implementation with only 9 traces. In our experiments, we validate the attack on a Cortex-M4-based development board and the success rate of key recovery is almost up to 100% in 1000 experiments. According to the experiment results, the masked encoder can not prevent side-channel attacks efficiently and newer masking techniques are needed.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides a strong technical guarantee for intelligent transportation, greatly facilitating people's daily travel. At the same time, its security problems are becoming increasingly prominent. Fortunately, the cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs) provide a security guarantee for the IoV access authentication, traffic management, data communication, etc., which is the core and cornerstone of the IoV cryptographic technology. However, the IoV has high requirements for timeliness, and its communication resources are precious, so its necessary to ensure that the overhead of the cryptographic module is small and the delay is low. In this paper, we adopt SM2 Elliptic Curve Public Key Digital Signature Algorithm-with fast operation speed and short signature data to implement cryptographic ICs. We design and optimize its hardware design to balance overhead and efficiency. Based on the Montgomery point multiplication algorithm in Lopez-Dahab (LD) projection coordinates, we have researched the core point multiplication operation in SM2 and optimized the time-consuming operation in finite fields, which improved the computational efficiency of SM2. Finally, we completed the hardware design of SM2 on GF(2 233 ) domain and verified it on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA development board. The experiment results show that the design occupies a total of 77,665 Slice LUTs and merely takes 2.57 Î¼s to complete a signature verification. The signature verification rate is 389,105 times/s. Compared with traditional solutions, our proposed method achieves less overhead and little latency.}

	abstract = {To tackle with advanced persistent threats against industrial control system, Siemens has developed S7CommPlus- TLS, a new version of the encrypted protocol challenging traditional DPI-based anomaly detection methods. However, the communication mode of industrial control system leads to the overlapping of periodic traffic and sensitive behavior traffic, and thus makes mainstream encrypted traffic classification methods exhibit a poor performance in S7CommPlus-TLS protocol. Therefore, we design a multiple clustering framework called MCFM, which can automatically extract sensitive behavior of S7CommPlus-TLS from network traffic. The first-clustering is used as a pre-processing model to separate and remove periodic traffic from overlapping flows according to the communication mode of industrial control system. Besides, we employ the second- clustering as a generator to extract the fingerprint of sensitive behaviors. Our comprehensive experiments on the simulation dataset covering six sensitive behaviors indicate that MCFM achieves an excellent performance, and outperforms present cutting-edge methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing industrial control system from the perspective of encrypted traffic analysis.}

	abstract = {One of the solutions for rewriting blockchain data is to replace the standard hash function with a chameleon hash function. This enables users with the trapdoor to generate hash collision for rewriting operation. However, such rewritable blockchain solution may allow users to have unlimited rewriting permissions. This is undesirable as rewritable blockchains should still maintain a certain degree of immutability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained one-time rewritable blockchain scheme that supports traitor tracing and bilateral access control. The proposed solution is the first that combines one-time chameleon hash function and traceable attribute-based encryption to realize one-time rewriting blockchain at the same time tracking for malicious users who leak the private key. Furthermore, our solution offers bilateral access control by integrating with fog computing. We also verify the performance of the proposed scheme with experimental analysis.}

	abstract = {Whether it be congestion control in cities or massive access in the Internet, these dynamic behaviors can be abstracted as flow demand between origin-destination node pairs (OD pairs) in the network. Links in complex systems are with notable heterogeneity, which means the volume of flow varies greatly, resulting in some critical links being more likely to congest under the flow attack, reducing the service capability of the system, and even causing network collapses. To explore how flow dynamics influences the network functionality and stability under congestion, we propose a link-based flow attack strategy that significantly degrades the service capability between OD pairs. In this approach, we first extract the routing paths and score the vulnerability of links between OD pairs, then an attack flow allocation rule based on critical links is designed to efficiently attack the target flow between OD pairs. Experiments on real-world networks show that the proposed strategy can quickly identify critical links and accurately attack the target flow. Besides, the proposed method provides positive and unique insights for defense strategy and network topology optimization.}

	abstract = {Ethereum, the largest blockchain for running smart contracts, has been widely used, especially in financial and cryptocurrency exchange applications. Among them, Tornado Cash is a typical financial application that protects the privacy of users with anonymous transactions. However, users need to pay prohibitively high gas (transaction fees for smart contract calls) for anonymous transactions, which hinders Tornado Cash from wide applications. To address this issue, we introduced a new approach that shifts the high gas-consuming operations on smart contracts to local users. Furthermore, we use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the operations are properly executed. The smart contract only needs to verify and update the results, which significantly reduces the gas fees of Tornado Cash. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype and showed that our proposed method could save more than 61% of gas consumption of current operations while maintaining the privacy feature of Tornado Cash. Finally, we discussed further applications and open problems of our approach.}

	abstract = {The adoption of blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasing due to the various benefits that blockchain brings, such as security and privacy. Current blockchain models for mobile IoT assume there are fixed, powerful edge devices capable of providing global communication to all the nodes in the network. However, due to the mobile nature of IoT or network partitioning problems (NPP), nodes can move out of a cell area and split into smaller independent peer-to-peer subnetworks. Existing blockchain structures either do not support the network partitioning problem or have limitations. This paper introduces a multidimensional, graph-based blockchain structure, that utilizes k-dimensional spatiotemporal space, to address the challenges of applying blockchain in mobile networks with limited resources. Experimental results show that a multidimensional blockchain structure can improve scalability and efficiency as the blockchain grows in size, similar to logarithmic growth, and reduce the longest chain length by more than 99.99% compared to the traditional chain-based blockchain structure.}

	abstract = {Redactable blockchain allows modifiers or voting committees with modification privileges to edit the data on the chain. Among them, trapdoor holders in chameleon-based hash redactable blockchains can quickly compute hash collisions for arbitrary data without breaking the link of the hash-chain. However, chameleon-based hash redactable blockchain schemes have difficulty solving issues such as editing operations with different granularity or conflicts and auditing modifiers that abuse editing privileges. To address the above challenges, we propose a redactable blockchain with Cross-audit and Diversity Editing (CDEdit). The proposed scheme distributes subdivided transaction-level and block-level tokens to the matching modifier committee to weaken the influence of central power. A number of modifiers are unpredictably selected based on reputation value proportions and the mapping of the consistent hash ring to enable diversity editing operations, and resist Sybil attacks. Meanwhile, an adaptive cross-auditing protocol is proposed to adjust the roles of modifiers and auditors dynamically. This protocol imposes a reputation penalty on the modifiers of illegal edits and solves the problems of abuse of editing privileges and collusion attacks. In addition, We used ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and chameleon hashes with ephemeral trapdoor (CHET) for data modification, and present a system steps and security analysis of CDEdit. Finally, the extensive comparisons and evaluations show that our scheme costs less time overhead than other schemes and is suitable for complex application scenarios, e.g. IoT data management.}

This paper proposes a fuzzing input generation technique based on VAE-GAN, which introduces the representation learning process of variational auto-encoder for traditional generative adversarial networks, so that it can learn and utilize the character information of testcases, improving the stability of training and generate various testcases. It is shown that testcases generated by VAE-GAN trigger more unique tuples than other existing generative adversarial networks on 3 among 4 selected target programs. Moreover, compared with the AFL mutation training set, testcases generated by VAE-GAN can improve code coverage by up to 11.87%, and the discovery rate of 15.74% and 5.36% in the unique crashes and hangs respectively.}

	abstract = {Elections make a fundamental contribution to democratic governance and are very important to select the appropriate person to determine the fate of a nation while a large number of citizens do not trust the ballot-paper-based voting system. As a result, e-Voting is being adopted by various countries throughout the world. With advantages, there are a number of constraints of e-voting systems, a single vulnerability can lead to large-scale manipulations of voting results. Leveraging and intersecting both cutting-edge technologies including biometric and blockchain technology can address the limitations of current e-Voting frameworks. In this research, we analyze the requirements for systems modeling of voting technology and possible opportunities to adopt biometrics and blockchain technology. Based on the requirements analysis, we propose a biometric-enabled and hyperledger fabric-based voting framework to automate identity verification that will ensure transparency and security of electronic voting. We utilize the software architecture analysis method and active reviews for intermediate designs for evaluating the proposed framework. Demonstration indicates the efficiency and quality attributes of architectural design that shall lead us to implement the system in real-world scenarios in future studies. Initially, we develop a Webbased prototype to demonstrate the framework. In future studies, we aim to implement on large scale and evaluate the prototype against the requirements and security standard.}

	abstract = {It is demonstrated that deep neural networks can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks, substantial research on adversarial defenses is being carried out, of which input transformation is a typical category of defenses. However, because the transformation also has an impact on the accuracy of clean examples, the existing transformation-based defenses usually adopt minor transformations such as shift and scaling, which limits the defense effect of the transformation to some extent. To this end, we propose a method by using dynamic and diverse transformations for defending against adversarial attacks. Firstly, we constructed a transformation pool that contains both minor and major transformations (e.g., flip, rotate). Secondly, we retrained the model with the data transformed by major transformations to ensure that the performance of model itself is not affected. Finally, we dynamically select transformations to preprocess the input of the model to defend against adversarial examples. We conducted extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compared our method with the state-of-the-art adversarial training and transformation-based defenses. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods, improving the robustness of the model against adversarial examples greatly while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples.

	abstract = {AI systems face potential hardware security threats. Existing AI systems generally use the heterogeneous architecture of CPU + Intelligent Accelerator, with PCIe bus for communication between them. Security mechanisms are implemented on CPUs based on the hardware security isolation architecture. But the conventional hardware security isolation architecture does not include the intelligent accelerator on the PCIe bus. Therefore, from the perspective of hardware security, data offloaded to the intelligent accelerator face great security risks. In order to effectively integrate intelligent accelerator into the CPUâ€™s security mechanism, a novel hardware security isolation architecture is presented in this paper. The PCIe protocol is extended to be security-aware by adding security information packaging and unpacking logic in the PCIe controller. The hardware resources on the intelligent accelerator are isolated in fine-grained. The resources classified into the secure world can only be controlled and used by the software of CPUâ€™s trusted execution environment. Based on the above hardware security isolation architecture, a security isolation spiking convolutional neural network accelerator is designed and implemented in this paper. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security isolation architecture has no overhead on the bandwidth and latency of the PCIe controller. The architecture does not affect the performance of the entire hardware computing process from CPU data offloading, intelligent accelerator computing, to data returning to CPU. With low hardware overhead, this security isolation architecture achieves effective isolation and protection of input data, model, and output data. And this architecture can effectively integrate hardware resources of intelligent accelerator into CPUâ€™s security isolation mechanism.}

	abstract = {With the demand for security, the Internet companies and institutions have formed independent trust domains by utilizing different cryptographic settings, which brings up the problem of cross-domain authentication. To solve the cross-domain authentication problem, researchers have proposed many schemes that can be divided into two categories: centralized and blockchain-based. However, the challenges of privacy leakage, low efficiency, and incomplete cross-domain have not been effectively overcome in existing schemes. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based Privacy-preserving scheme for Cross-Domain Authentication (BPCDA). To realize complete cross-domain, the blockchain is introduced for building trust between different domains. For lightweight management, the Pedersen Commitment is adopted for identity voucher generation. In addition, the Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proof algorithm is utilized for mutual and anonymous authentication. The security analysis and the performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed BPCDA is secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient.}

	abstract = {Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are elaborately designed for malicious purposes and are imperceptible to the human perceptual system. Autoencoder, when trained solely over benign examples, has been widely used for (self-supervised) adversarial detection based on the assumption that adversarial examples yield larger reconstruction errors. However, because lacking adversarial examples in its training and the too strong generalization ability of autoencoder, this assumption does not always hold true in practice. To alleviate this problem, we explore how to detect adversarial examples with disentangled label/semantic features under the autoencoder structure. Specifically, we propose Disentangled Representation-based Reconstruction (DRR). In DRR, we train an autoencoder over both correctly paired label/semantic features and incorrectly paired label/semantic features to reconstruct benign and counterexamples. This mimics the behavior of adversarial examples and can reduce the unnecessary generalization ability of autoencoder. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art self-supervised detection methods under different adversarial attacks and different victim models, and it exhibits better performance in various metrics (area under the ROC curve, true positive rate, and true negative rate) for most attack settings. Though DRR is initially designed for visual tasks only, we demonstrate that it can be easily extended for natural language tasks as well. Notably, different from other autoencoder-based detectors, our method can provide resistance to the adaptive adversary.}

	abstract = {The state-of-the-art HotStuff operates an efficient pipeline in which a stable leader drives decisions with linear communication. However, with the unifying proposing-voting pattern, it takes two rounds of messages to produce a certified proposal, which severely limits the performance of the consensus protocol and makes it difficult for the blockchain to exert the bandwidth and concurrency of modern operating systems. Thus, this paper developed a new consensus protocol, called Multi-pipeline HotStuff, for permissioned blockchain. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first protocol that combines multiple pipelines of HotStuff to propose batches in order, such that proposals are built optimistically when a correct replica realizes that the current proposal is valid and will be certified by quorum votes in the near future. Simultaneous proposing and voting allow the protocol to produce more proposals in every two rounds of messages, it further boosts the throughput at a comparable latency with that of HotStuff. The evaluation experiment confirmed that the throughput of the proposed protocol outperformed HotStuff by approximately 60% without significantly increasing end-to-end latency under varying system sizes. Even if the protocol frequently performs view-change phase due to network asynchrony, its optimization continues to demonstrate better performance.}

	abstract = {Traffic sign recognition (TSR) system is essential for autonomous vehicle and is vulnerable to security threats from adversarial attacks. The existing adversarial attacks for TSR are invasive and suffer from poor concealment and high computational complexity, and thus have low feasibility in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a non-invasive modulated LED illumination-based adversarial attack scheme. By generating luminance flashes imperceptible to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of lighting such as LED streetlights and exploiting the rolling shutter mechanism of CMOS sensors of in-vehicle imaging system, the proposed attack scheme can successfully perform adversarial attacks on TSR system by implanting luminance information perturbations into the images acquired by autonomous vehicle and thus poisoning the image data fed into TSR system. Depending on the modulation frequency and pattern of LED illumination, the proposed attack scheme enables denial of service (DoS) attack that leads to traffic sign detection failure and escape attack that leads to traffic sign misclassification, with the advantages of superior concealment, low computational complexity and high practical feasibility. Experiments are conducted with two benchmark datasets (GTSDB and GTSRB) and two state-of-the-art models of TSR detection and TSR classification, YOLOv5m and Sill-Net respectively, in both the digital and physical world. Experimental results show that the proposed DoS attack on the TSR detection model (YOLOv5m) can reach the success rate of 90.00% and the proposed escape attack on the TSR classification model (Sill-Net) can achieve the success rate of 35.00%.}

	abstract = {Digital forensics has become an important topic during this digital devices era. One major problem is extracting critical information from a digital device, and one of such data sources from a digital device is the main memory. The main memory holds many data that can be as simple as a text and a number or as complex as a data structure that holds cryptography keys. In line with the growth of the digital devices era, the need for privacy is also becoming an emerging topic. Encryption is one of the ways to achieve privacy during data transmission. As mentioned, the main memory might hold the session keys to encrypt or decrypt such secure data transmissions. This paper proposes a pure brute-force and a machine learning augmented brute force method to extract session keys from the main memory. In addition, we reduce the training data footprint using a novel entropy-based preprocessing method. We choose the most commonly used secure communication protocols: Secure Shell (SSH) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). With the help of machine learning, our method becomes efficient compared to the brute-force method. Our performance evaluation shows that our methods can extract the keys with high precision and considerably fast run-time.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet network, cyber attacks (mainly DDOS, U2R, Probe, Infiltration and Heart-bleed etc) on networks and computer systems have also increased expeditiously. Intrusion detection system has proven to be one of the most effective methods to resist cyber attacks. Most traditional machine learning methods can only learn shallow features of the data, so they are weak in detecting complex data. Recently, ensemble learning has begun to be applied in network intrusion detection due to their excellent generalization ability. However, most of them are designed based on machine learning methods. They usually do not have multiple hidden layers, which will lead to low detection accuracy. Furthermore, when the base learners in ensemble learning make voting decisions, the data can be easily tampered, which incurs wrong detection results. To solve the above problems, we propose an intrusion detection method based on blockchain and collaborative ensemble learning. In detail, to address the low detection rate of machine learning model, we design an ensemble deep learning approach combining with a weighted dynamic voting mechanism, which can enhance base learners with excellent performance and weaken base learners with poor performance. To solve the problem of data tampering during individual model voting decisions, we explore blockchain to verify the detection results of the individual model and the final results of the voting. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system on the CICIDS-2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed system.}

	abstract = {Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) has been widely used in aviation datalink. However, for lack of security designs, ACARS faces increasing security threats such as eavesdropping and message injection. Although several security solutions has been proposed on aviation surveillance message, such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, those on ACARS have received far less attention. To further improve the session security and privacy of civil aviation users, we put forwards a compatible protocol for ACARS datalink to protect message security as well as aircraft identity privacy. The proposed solution provides communication confidentiality, and supports data integrity and user identity verification. Meanwhile, by replacing the aircraftâ€™s identity transmitted in plaintext with a variable anonymity, the privacy of an aircraft is protected from the disclosure of aircraft identity. Moreover, our protocol is compatible with current ACARS standards, making the proposed solution easy-to-deploy and practical. Formal analysis and simulations are carried out to make sure the security of proposed protocol.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of computer technology, the cross-subject network components (CSNC) is widely used in software. However, the existing of vulnerabilities in CSNC may seriously affect the security of software, which attracts the attention of software tester. This paper proposes a formal-based vulnerability detection method called FVDM for CSNC to detect the security vulnerabilities and defects in the logic of components. The proposed FVDM firstly selects the singleton as the medium of abstract computation as well as uses the formal description language to construct a vulnerability propagation model; And then, the FVDM classifies the vulnerabilities into explicit and implicit vulnerabilities through analyzing the types of vulnerabilities, thereby designing the vulnerability detection algorithm for explicit vulnerabilities and implicit vulnerabilities respectively. The experimental results on several COM (Component Object Model) components show that the proposed FVDM can detect the buffer overflow as well as illegal access vulnerabilities in the components.}

However, the existing diagnostic methods still have a large space to be improved, In this paper, we proposed a novel method for heart sound classification. Our method consists of two stages. In the first stage, we preprocessed the heart sound signal, including two steps of denoising and downsampling, to reduce the noise and decrease the complexity of processing. In the second stage, we classify the processed signal, including framing and input network, and finally output three types of results. Our method was validated on the CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Dataset. The result shows the F1 score reached 0.922 and is better compared to other networksâ€™ results.}

	abstract = {In this study, we combined the advantages of two spontaneous brain-computer interface instruction paradigms, conceptual imagery and motor imagery, to develop a smart home control system with better semantics for device selection and more types of device operations. The BCI system allowed users to control three kinds of household equipment: lamps, water heaters, and electric fans. A Raspberry Pi was used to simulate the usage scenarios, where users issued instructions for home equipment selection through conceptual imagery and issued specific instructions for home equipment control through motor imagery. We used Emotiv Epoc to collect EEG data and sent the data to Raspberry Pi, and we built a deep learning-based model for data processing and classification, converting EEG signals into command signals that could control home equipment. Five subjects were recruited to test the performance of the smart home control system and completed a questionnaire to evaluate their willingness to use the system after the experiments. The average accuracy rate of the system operation was 68.9%, with the highest of 73.3%, which proved that the brain-computer interface control system combining the two instruction paradigms was feasible. Users generally showed acceptance of the ease of the system use, giving an average of 5.4 out of 6 ratings.}

	abstract = {The k-induction algorithm is a well-known verification technique that combines bounded model checking with an inductive approach to verify program safety. Many software verification tools have implemented it. The performance of k-induction is dependent on the inductive loop invariant. However, it is hard to generate useful invariants, especially when the loop construction is complex and nested by other constructions such as branches. To solve this problem, we introduce value analysis into k-induction, which is used to generate a set of custom loop invariants according to safety properties. In contrast to general loop invariants provided by loop invariant generators, custom invariants are made to verify the property, and the induction method converges with them more quickly. Our experiments show that combining k-induction with the invariants were produced by value analysis significantly increases effectiveness and efficiency and outperforms existing implementations of k-induction based software verification in terms of successful verification results.}

	abstract = {Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol is an essential password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). The protocol is specifically designed to obtain a session key and it has been widely used in various scenarios due to its attractive security features. In the SRP protocol, the server is not required to save any data directly associated with passwords. And this makes attackers who manage to corrupt the server fail to impersonate the client unless performing a brute-force search for the password. However, the development of quantum computing has potentially made classic DLP-based public-key cryptography schemes not secure, including the SRP protocol. So it is significant to design a quantum-resistant SRP protocol. In this paper, based on the original scheme, we propose a post-quantum SRP protocol from the learning with errors (LWE) problem. And we give rigorous proof and analyses on the correctness and security of the scheme. Besides being resistant to known quantum attacks, it maintains the various secure qualities of the original protocol.}

	abstract = {The exoskeleton robot to assist load-carrying has received much attention in recent years. It is a highly coupled human-machine system. In order to realize the compliant motion control target and complete the reliable power-assisted control for its wearer, it is necessary to accurately identify and predict the wearer's motion intention in real time. In this study, based on the foot pressure signal and the detected human motion information, the multi-sensor fusion method is used to complete the recognition of the wearer's motion intention. For the recognition of motion patterns, by comparing the recognition accuracy, resource consumption and real-time processing ability of various machine learning algorithms, the paper is finally determined that the support vector machine (SVM) is used to realize the action recognition for 8 daily motion patterns (Sit, Stand, Walk, Run, Ramp Ascent, Ramp Descent, Stairs Ascent and Stairs Descent), and the average recognition accuracy rate reaches 95%. For the prediction of motion phase and motion switching events, the neural-fuzzy inference method is used to complete the motion phase recognition and state switching event prediction. On the given test set, the accuracy of phase recognition is 99%, and the average absolute value of the deviation between the predicted state switching moment and the real value is around 61.6ms, which meets the requirements of exoskeleton compliance control for prediction time.}

	abstract = {Estimating accurate torque and speed is critical to control the operation of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). But the temperature factors are usually neglected in existing studies, which degrades estimation accuracy. In this paper, a thermal-aware digital twin model is proposed for PMSM to estimate motor torque and speed with the motor temperature and d-q axis current and voltage. Firstly, the motor parameters related to torque and speed are extracted by the Spearman correlation coefficients. Moreover, the stator winding temperature is selected as the input feature. Secondly, a digital model based on BP neural networks (BPNN) is established to estimate torque and speed. Thirdly, the parameters of the BPNN model are optimized by the whale optimization algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed and avoid local optima. Finally, experimental results show that the mean square error (MSE) of the BPNN model considering the temperature factors is reduced by 8.3%, which verifies that there is an effect of temperature on the torque and speed estimation. The MSE of the proposed method is reduced by 11.7% on average, which confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed method compared with the classical BPNN model.}

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the knowledge of cyber and physical threats that help mitigate potential cyber attacks. The rapid evolution of the current threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen their security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data contains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak sensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation. While current approaches allow restricting CTI sharing to trusted organisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be verified and disseminated â€˜differentiallyâ€™ (i.e., selective information sharing) with policies and metrics flexibly defined by an organisation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to share sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner. We discuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the advantages of the proposed CTI sharing framework. We further present a detailed proof of concept using the Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can facilitate the exchange of CTI without creating significant additional overheads.}

	abstract = {As a continuous variant of Multi-armed bandits (MAB),\nX\n-armed bandits have enriched many applications of online machine learning like personalized recommendation system. However, the attack and defense to the\nX\n-armed bandits remain largely unexplored, though the MAB has proved to be vulnerable. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and investigate the robustness analysis for the\nX\n-armed bandits. Specifically, we consider action-manipulation attack, which is practical but harder than the existing reward-manipulation attack. We propose an attack algorithm based on a lower bound tree (LBT), which can continuously hijack the learnerâ€™s action by perturbing\nX\n-armed banditsâ€™ high confidence tree (HCT) construction. As a result, the nodes including the arm targeted by the attacker is selected frequently with a sublinear attack cost. To defend against the LBT attack, we propose a robust version of the HCT algorithm, called RoHCT. We theoretically analyze that the regret of RoHCT is related to the upper bound of the total cost Q and still sublinear to total number of rounds T. We carry out experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of LBT and RoHCT.}

Deep learning methods have been widely used to classify network traffic for their high classification performance. The application of adversarial samples in computer vision confirms that deep learning methods are flawed, allowing existing methods to generate incorrect results with high confidence. In this paper, the adversarial samples are used on the network traffic classification model, causing the CNN model to produce incorrect classification results for network traffic. By training the classification model adversarially, we validate the training effect and improve the classification accuracy by means of the FGSM attack method. By using the adversarial samples to the network traffic data, our approach enables proactive defence against intranet eavesdropping before the attack occurs by influencing the attackerâ€™s classification model to misclassify.}

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of network construction, 4G/5G networks have gradually developed into hybrid multi-frequency heterogeneous networks, while the difficulty of inter-RAT mobility assurance is gradually increasing. Traditional interoperability optimization requires enormous labor costs, and the accuracy is low. This paper proposes an AI-based collaborative optimization scheme under multi-frequency heterogeneous 4G/5G networks based on the XGBoost prediction model and DNN algorithm. It aims to comprehensively improve the performance of different users in multi-frequency heterogeneous 4G/5G networks in terms of 4G/5G neighborhood re-organization and intelligent optimization of 4G/5G interoperability parameters. The results show that the proposed scheme has high accuracy and strong generalization, which is critical in improving user mobility perception under complex network structures. The scheme contributes to the network operatorsâ€™ efficiency improvement and intelligent transformation process.}

	abstract = {Proving ownership rights on relational databases is an important issue. The robust watermarking technique could claim ownership by insertion information about the data owner. Hence, it is vital to improving the robustness of watermarking technique in that intruders could launch types of attacks to corrupt the inserted watermark. Furthermore, attributes are explicit and operable objectives to destroy the watermark. To my knowledge, there does not exist a comprehensive solution to resist attribute attack. In this paper, we propose a robust watermarking technique that is robust against subset and attribute attacks. The novelties lie in several points: applying the classifier to reorder watermarked attributes, designing a secret sharing mechanism to duplicate watermark independently on each attribute, and proposing twice majority voting to correct errors caused by attacks for improving the accuracy of watermark detection. In addition, our technique has features of blind, key-based, incrementally updatable, and low false hit rate. Experiments show that our algorithm is robust against subset and attribute attacks compared with AHK, DEW, and KSF algorithms. Moreover, it is efficient with running time in both insertion and detection phases.}

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death in the world. In the early stage of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia is often accompanied. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out safe and effective arrhythmia detection for prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. With the increase in widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning, multi-class arrhythmia classification based on automatic feature extraction of ECG has become increasingly attractive. However, the majority of studies cannot accept varied-length ECG signals and have limited performance in detecting multi-class arrhythmias. In this study, we propose a multi-label classification network based on the multi-scale feature fusion module for arrhythmia in 12-lead varied-length ECG. Our model utilizes the complementary power between different structures, which include group convolution block, Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer, and multi-scale feature fusion module. The proposed method can extract features from every lead separately for 12-lead varied-length records, and effectively achieve multi-scale feature extraction and cross-scale information complementarity of ECG by integrating multiple convolution kernels with different receptive fields. The experimental results show that our model achieved an overall classification F1 score of 83.3%. Combining all these excellent features, this model offers a solution for varied-length signal processing problems.}

	abstract = {Industrial wireless sensor Networks (IWSNs) are widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. However, the rapid growth of sensor nodes and the transmission of a large number of redundant data lead to excessive energy consumption and accelerate the death of wireless sensor networks. In order to reduce redundant data transmission and energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, a data refusion scheme based on layered network structure (RF-LNS) is proposed. The whole sensor network is divided into direct transmission layer and cluster layer. Cluster layer uses non-uniform clustering to balance network energy consumption and perform the first data fusion. At the same time, a low redundancy data refusion algorithm is designed to perform the second data fusion in the direct transmission layer. Simulation results show that compared with other protocols, RF-LNS scheme can save the energy of network nodes more effectively, reduce the energy consumption rate, and prolong the life of wireless sensor network.}

Listening for bruits during a physical exam is a subjective examination that can detect stenosis also called vascular narrowing when properly performed. Phonoangiograms (PAGs) which is a mathematical analysis of bruits increase the objectivity and sensitivity and permit quantification of stenosis. In this paper, we proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) for PAGs to automatically classify vascular stenosis. In particular, we added an auxiliary waveform to improve the classification performance. Moreover, we used the method of inter-patient verification to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the total F1 score, recall, and precision of the proposed method are 0.984, 1.000, and 0.969 respectively.

	abstract = {Future networks are towards autonomous, with a high level of automatic and intelligent abilities. There are several domains and layers in operator networks, malfunctions can be transmitted from lower layers to upper layers, and from one domain to another domain. At present, cross-domain network malfunctions are mainly relied on the operation and maintenance staff of each professional network to analyze and dispatch orders, resulting in repeated orders and increased human cost. The first and important step of malfunction diagnosis is the construction of network topology. However, cross-domain network topology cannot be associated automatically at present. Based on the performance data, a new method using AI technologies is proposed in this paper, which can associate the connecting cross-domain network ports automatically. The principle is that a same time sequence similarity is shared by the connected ports. Taking the data from real networks and comparing with the existing topology, the connecting relations can be 100% correctly recognized. This method can be widely used to any cross-domain networks, without changing current network equipment.}

	abstract = {The prediction of driving range is very important for electric bus, but there is usually a difficulty: battery aging affects the accuracy of driving range prediction. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a driving range prediction method for electric bus, which is robust to the battery aging effect. Firstly, we extract the features that affect the driving range from the real-world dataset, quantify the correlation between them and the driving range by grey correlation analysis. Then through the feature enhancement technology, the time window processing is used to mitigate the influence of battery aging, and the time information hidden in the historical period sequence is deeply excavated. On this basis, we establish the driving range prediction model based on k-nearest neighbors regression, where the key parameters are optimized with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Numerous experimental results show that compared with the classical methods, the method proposed in this paper has higher prediction accuracy especially when the batteries undergo significant aging effects.}

It is introducing anomalies in artificial way, allowing for fine-grained evaluation with adjustable sliding window sizes and preprocessing configuration. The usage of the benchmark, including demonstrated data collection, does not require any additional hardware other than a standard computer. The benchmark uses the output of llvm-objdump program to focus on non-library code which allows for rapid evaluation of various detection methods with different configurations. The proposed tool extracts features derived from processorâ€™s PC and instruction type information and then utilizes the features to identify abnormal behavior using 4 different anomaly detection algorithms. New detection methods can be easily incorporated into the benchmark, which provides a solid foundation for evaluating novel, previously unseen methods against methods we selected for our experiment.}

New services formed by the convergence of mobile network services and broadband network services (referred to as fixed-mobile convergence services) have become an important strategy. Through business innovation, telecom operators can bundle mobile services with broadband services, which can enhance user stickiness and increase business revenue. Based on the joint analysis of mobile network data and broadband network data, this paper proposes a rule-based and model-based integrated method for mining potential fixed-mobile convergence target users. After applying this method to the real market for single mobile contract user transferring to convergent contract, results show that the proposed method for exploiting potential target users can increase the conversion rate of convergence users.}

	abstract = {Modern processors make use of optimization techniques such as cache and speculation mechanisms to greatly improve performance. But recent research has found that these techniques can also be exploited by attackers to perform powerful side-channel attacks. A large number of powerful cache-based attacks have been replicated and enhanced over Intel X86- and ARM-based architectures, but there is a relative lack of research on RISC-V-based architectures. Xuantie-910 and BOOM are both RISC-V-based processors. So far, cache-side channels in the unprivileged case of Xuantie-910 have not been proven, while cache attacks against BOOM are proliferating. There are two types of caches, including physically-indexed physically-tagged (PIPT) cache (adopted by Xuantie-910) and virtually-indexed physically-tagged (VIPT) cache (adopted by BOOM), corresponding to two different cache addressing forms. VIPT has higher addressing performance than PIPT, since it can directly obtain cache line index from virtual address. In this paper, we study Xuantie-910 and BOOM to explore the impact of cache design on the security of RISC-V-based microarchitecture. Specifically, we compare the impact of their cache addressing forms on precise flushing of cache lines at specified locations, which plays an important role in cache side-channel attacks. Experimental results show that for the VIPT cache in BOOM, the location-specified cache lines can be accurately flushed, and Spectre attack can be successfully carried out by using the cache side-channel. On the other hand, for the PIPT cache in Xuantie-910, it is impossible for attackers to directly and accurately flush the specified location of cache without affecting performance, which hinders the success of cache side-channel attacks. This provides us with an insight that one can adopt a VIPT-based cache with a mechanism similar to PIPT for preventing the accurate access of cache line index, which can not only keep the advantage of high-performance addressing in VIPT but also improve chip security.}

	abstract = {Mobile Internet is an integral part of daily life and the development of the world. The delay of mobile Internet directly affects the income of enterprises that provide Internet services and our living standards. According to research, DNS is one of the two most important factors affecting Internet latency. DNS relies on extensive caching for good performance. Additionally, each DNS zone provides caching to improve DNS response speed, but most caching is recursive. In terms of authoritative caching, except for the root cache, the caches of other tlds are less concerned. This paper analyzes the impact of domestically deployed .com and .net caches on resolution time, hoping to find out the impact of tld cache on DNS resolution speed. To this end, we have an online deployment at China Mobile Communications Group Henan Co., Ltd. A large number of experimental results show that the tld cache can greatly improve the DNS resolution speed and reduce the Internet delay.}

	abstract = {Software in modern vehicles is becoming increasingly complex and subject to vulnerabilities that an intruder can exploit to alter the functionality of vehicles. To this purpose, we introduce CAHOOT, a novel context-aware Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting potential intrusions in both human and autonomous driving modes. In CAHOOT, context information consists of data collected at run-time by vehicleâ€™s sensors and engine. Such information is used to determine driversâ€™ habits and information related to the environment, like traffic conditions. In this paper, we create and use a dataset by using a customised version of the MetaDrive simulator capable of collecting both human and AI driving data. Then we simulate several types of intrusions while driving: denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. As a final step, we use the generated dataset to evaluate the CAHOOT algorithm by using several machine learning methods. The results show that CAHOOT is extremely reliable in detecting intrusions.}

	abstract = {The increased, widespread, unwarranted, and unaccountable use of Closed-Circuit TeleVision (CCTV) cameras globally has raised concerns about privacy risks for the last several decades. Recent technological advances implemented in CCTV cameras, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based facial recognition and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, fuel further concerns among privacy advocates. Machine learning and computer vision automated solutions may prove necessary and efficient to assist CCTV forensics of various types.In this paper, we introduce and release the first and only computer vision models are compatible with Microsoft common object in context (MS COCO) and capable of accurately detecting CCTV and video surveillance cameras in street view, generic images, and video frames.Our best detectors were built using 8,387 images, which were manually reviewed and annotated to contain 10,419 CCTV camera instances, and achieved an accuracy rate of up to 98.7%. This work proves fundamental to a handful of present and future applications that we discuss, such as CCTV forensics, pro-active detection of CCTV cameras, providing CCTV-aware routing, navigation, and geolocation services, and estimating their prevalence and density globally and on geographic boundaries.}

	abstract = {It is estimated that over 1 billion Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are operational worldwide. The advertised main benefits of CCTV cameras have always been the same; physical security, safety, and crime deterrence. The current scale and rate of deployment of CCTV cameras bring additional research and technical challenges for CCTV forensics as well, as for privacy enhancements.This paper presents the first end-to-end system for CCTV forensics and feasible privacy-enhancing applications such as exposure measurement, CCTV route recovery, CCTV-aware routing/navigation, and crowd-sourcing. For this, we developed and evaluated four complex and distinct modules (CCTVCV [1], OSRM-CCTV [2], BRIMA [3], CCTV-Exposure [4]), all of which are novel, unique, peer-reviewed, and can be used either separately or within an integrated end-to-end system such as CCTV-FullyAware. We release all our artefacts as open-source/open data. We hope our work will bootstrap policy-driving discussions and large-scale applications such as CCTV forensics and privacy-enhancing technologies.}

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning technology has been extensively utilized, leading to increased attention to the security of AI systems. In the field of image recognition, an attack technique called clean-label backdoor attack has been widely studied, and it is more difficult to detect than general backdoor attacks because data labels do not change when tampering with poisoning data during model training. However, there remains a lack of research on malware detection systems. Some of the current work is under the white-box assumption that requires knowledge of machine learning-based models which can be advantageous for attackers. In this study, we focus on clean-label backdoor attacks in malware detection systems and propose a new clean-label backdoor attack under the black-box assumption that does not require knowledge of machine learning-based models, which is riskier. The experimental evaluation of the proposed attack method shows that the attack success rate is up to 80.50% when the poisoning rate is 14.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed attack method. In addition, we experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction techniques in preventing clean-label backdoor attacks, and showed that it can reduce the attack success rate by 76.00%.}

It can appear in two types, the inter-domain website fingerprinting and the intra-domain webpage finger-printing. For the intra-domain webpages, they often generated from some predefined templates based on user inputs and may introduce more private details about user-concerned contents. To protect against intra-domain webpage fingerprinting, we adopt two web traffic generating methods to confuse traffic analyzers. The LRSO-Pad disrupts traffic analysis by padding random noise, and the DeOS performs traffic camouflage by sending decoy objects. We also test the fingerprinting and protecting influences imposed by the additional CDN traffic bursts. The conducted experiments validate our adopted methods.}

	abstract = {ECG is an important medium for doctors to observe the working state of the patientâ€™s heart, and the monitoring of patients based on ECG is very important in clinical diagnosis. The movement of the patient or the activities of other physiological organs in the process of collecting ECG will bring a lot of noise to the ECG signal acquisition, so it is necessary to de-noise the ECG signal with noise. In this paper, an U-net network based on Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM) channel attention is proposed to automatically denoise the noisy ECG signal. The ECG signals used are from clinical data marked by expert diagnostics. In addition, we also compared several popular denoising methods proposed in the past to conduct comparative experiments to verify the denoising performance of the model. The experimental results show that the proposed U-net network based on SRM channel attention can remove the noise contained in the ECG signal while retaining the characteristic shape of the ECG signal, and has a good effect in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error.}

	abstract = {When faced with massive data volumes, many current companies and institutions usually choose centralized databases or distributed databases to meet their data storage needs. But untrusted centralized third-party auditor can pose serious security problems. Malicious database service providers may tamper with or delete users data to achieve certain benefits, while returning false data integrity verification results to users. The traditional solution is to introduce a third-party auditor to ensure the reliability of the data verification results, but this third-party auditor may also be untrustworthy and partner with the database service provider to forge false data verification results. The centralization of the database system makes the verification of data integrity a difficult but necessary task. Therefore, we propose a data integrity verification scheme using smart contract (DIV-SC) to ensure the reliability of data integrity verification results in a centralized database environment. We introduce the blockchain as a decentralized third-party auditor. The immutability of the blockchain can ensure that the information stored on the blockchain will not be maliciously tampered with. Meanwhile, the smart contract deployed on the blockchain can ensure that the procedure of storing verification information and the verification procedure are correct and will not be affected by any malicious parties.}

	abstract = {The ground traffic demand of multi-beam satellites is growing rapidly, but resources such as satellite power and bandwidth are limited. Beam hopping (BH) alleviates the problem of insuffident satellite transmitters, but how to improve the utilization of limited resources to increase satellite throughput is still a challenge in the future. In this paper, starting from beam hopping, the bandwidth allocation in beam hopping systems is analyzed first. The results show that the effect of full frequency reuse works better than that of partial frequency reuse in the beam hopping system with fewer beams, but the former can reduce the complexity of problems. Afterwards, a deep reinforcement learning strategy combining power allocation and beam hopping (PABH) is proposed, which improves power utilization and satellite throughput to a certain extent, which proves that power allocation is feasible.}

	abstract = {In recent years, with the development of social economy and technology, the brain-computer interface based on motor imagery(MI-BCI) has gradually become the focus content of many re-searchers. However, the motor imagery EEG signal (MI-EEG) itself has the characteristics of non-linearity and low signal-to-noise ratio, and because the characteristics of different domains of MI-EEG cannot be effectively combined, the recognition rate of MI-EEG is unsatisfactory. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a Transformer-based one-dimensional convolutional neural network model(CNN-Transformer) for the classification and recognition of four types of motor imagery EEG signals. Firstly, the artifacts of the original EEG are removed and new time-space-frequency features are constructed by preprocessing such as bandpass filtering and PCA dimensionality; then, the local features in the temporal dimension are extracted through the convolution and pooling operations of 1D-CNN, while reducing the dimension of the time feature; next, the Transformer based on the attention mechanism is used to extract more abstract and high-level temporal features from multiple perspectives; finally, the classification results are integrated and output through the fully connected layer. The performance of the CNN-Transformer model is evaluated using the competition dataset 2008 BCI-Competition 2A. The results show that the average accuracy and kappa value of the CNN-Transformer model are as high as 99.29%(Â±0.07%) and 98.43%(Â±0.21), respectively, which are 3.72% and 7.68% higher than the classical architecture (CNN-LSTM). This model provides a design idea for improving the accuracy of MI-EEG classification and recognition, and also lays a foundation for the wide application of MI-BCI.}

	abstract = {At a time when end-to-end speech recognition technology is becoming more and more popular, we conduct research on various end-to-end speech technologies, and use the Transformer-based speech framework to study and find that its multi-head attention is not effective in local feature acquisition. And in the face of noise problems in real scenes, the training convergence speed is too slow. In order to solve the problems caused by Transformer, a new speech recognition framework based on MCNN-Transformer-CTC speech recognition method is proposed. Through MCNN (multi-stream convolutional neural network) in the pre-acoustic unit through multiple parallel channels Local feature extraction is carried out in terms of time width and spectral capability, which makes up for the lack of self-attention mechanism in local feature extraction, and the multitask learning method is used to add CTC structure to make up for the problem of slow training convergence. The training effect of this model on the Aishell1 dataset has reached a CER of 6.23%, which is a further improvement compared to the Transformer model.}

	abstract = {Enabled by Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networks (SDN), 5G networks benefit various industries (the so-called verticals) by supporting their technological and business needs flexibly and swiftly. However, a critical challenge is making high-quality joint optimal decisions for vertical demand mapping, involving Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement and optimization of network resources. In particular, to devise VNF placement schemes, network operators need to consider different objectives, such as minimizing operational costs or network latency, which are optimization objectives traditionally addressed separately. This paper studies the VNF placement for service function chains to minimize energy and traffic costs jointly. First, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Then we propose a joint optimization function to measure the energy consumption of physical nodes and traffic cost on links. Then, we improve the biogeography-based evolutionary algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results show that our method is effective for the proposed problem and outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.}

	abstract = {Intelligent connected vehicle platoon technology can reduce traffic congestion and vehicle fuel. However, attacks on the data transmitted by the platoon are one of the primary challenges encountered by the platoon during its travels. The false data injection (FDI) attack can lead to road congestion and even vehicle collisions, which can impact the platoon. However, the complexity of the cellular - vehicle to everything (C-V2X) environment, the single source of the message and the poor data processing capability of the on board unit (OBU) make the traditional detection methodsâ€™ success rate and response time poor. This study proposes a platoon state information fusion method using the communication characteristics of the platoon in C-V2X and proposes a novel platoon intrusion detection model based on this fusion method combined with sequential importance sampling (SIS). The SIS is a measured strategy of Monte Carlo integration sampling. Specifically, the method takes the status information of the platoon members as the predicted value input. It uses the leader vehicle status information as the posterior probability of the observed value to the current moment of the platoon members. The posterior probabilities of the platoon members and the weights of the platoon members at the last moment are used as input to update the weights of the platoon members at the current moment and obtain the desired platoon status information at the present moment. Moreover, it compares the status information of the platoon members with the desired status information to detect attacks on the platoon. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by simulation.}

However, such connectivity also brings network security risks.To protect the signal security of intersections, this paper designs a realistic signal attack model based on forged trajectory injection to simulate the potential attack that a smart attacker may launch, the key track points of queued vehicles were extracted, the traffic wave velocity of queued vehicles was used as the distance index to transform forged track recognition into an outlier detection problem, and a forged track detection algorithm based on hierarchical clustering was proposed. Experimental results show that under different attack targets and permeability, the highest detection rate is 95%, and the lowest is 67%. This method does not require training, learning and high computation power of edge equipment. Therefore, it has a certain potential for intersection signal timing using CV trajectory.}

	abstract = {Due to the increasing popularity of cloud computing and privacy preservation concerns, sensitive data should be encrypted before outsourcing to the cloud and data utilization becomes a challenging issue. Searchable encryption (SE) is a promising technique to address this problem. Most existing searchable encryption schemes only support accurate keyword but fuzzy keyword search schemes are appreciated in practice. Moreover, in some application scenarios like the video on demand systems, data owners only hope to give the access of their data to those who have payed but authenticated user identity may often change. Therefore, dynamic user attribute updating should be considered. To solve about issues, we propose a fuzzy secure keyword search scheme over encrypted cloud data with dynamic fine-grained access control. We design a novel fuzzy keyword index to retrieve corresponding documents. To reduce the computation cost, the cloud server selects most relevant top-k documents and return them to the data users. The ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) technique is introduced to implement fine-grained access control. Meanwhile, the basic CP-ABE is improved to meet the practical need of user attribute updating. Extensive security and performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme is highly efficient and can satisfy the security requirements for fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data.}

	abstract = {Traditional localization techniques cannot meet the requirements of indoor localization accuracy. Although PDR can obtain high localization accuracy in a relatively short period of time, its localization error will gradually accumulate as the user's walking distance increases. Therefore, this paper proposes a particle filter fusion-based guided trajectory tracking method, which combines pedestrian heading estimation and convolutional neural network-based landmark detection method to achieve real-time tracking of position and trajectory. The article uses the PDR method for estimation, including the number of steps and step lengths, to achieve the calculation of the position, collects the data of pre-set landmark points in the guide path by inertial sensors, and realizes the landmark point recognition based on CNN. The article designs two sets of experiments to analyze the fusion localization results, and compared with the traditional PDR method. The actual experimental results show that the localization error of this method is less than 1m, which effectively reduces the cumulative error of PDR.}

In parallel, the number of possible threats and attacks has also increased, thus emphasizing the need for accurate automatic malware detection systems. In this paper, we design and evaluate a system to detect whether a traffic object (biflow) is benign or malicious, possibly understanding its specific nature in the latter case. The proposal leverages machine learning in a hierarchical fashion, in order to capitalize on the structure of the traffic data and reap both design and performance benefits. The comparative evaluationâ€”performed considering the public CICAndMal2017 datasetâ€”assesses the performance of several machine-learning algorithms and witnesses that the hierarchical approach leads to improved performance w.r.t. the flat approach (up to +0.18 F1-score, depending on the granularity of the analysis and the machine learning algorithm considered). In addition, we evaluate the impact of a reject-option mechanism, showing the trade-off between classification accuracy and ratio of classified biflows.}

	abstract = {To balance the performance of chaos and the algorithmâ€™s efficiency, a Henon-Modulated-Iterative (HMI) map is constructed in this paper. And the chaotic characteristics of the HMI map are analyzed from three aspects: bifurcation map, Lyapunov exponent and balance degree. On this basis, an image encryption algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and four square matrix encoding is proposed. Then, the random sequence generation module is designed using CNN, and the generated random sequence is used to construct the scrambling coordinate matrix and modify the position of the pixel values. Finally, the scrambled image is diffused by four square matrix encoding so that the pixel values are evenly distributed, while non-sequential diffusion using hexadecimal addition and subtraction rules improves the security of the encryption algorithm. Experimental results show that the encryption algorithm proposed in this paper has a good encryption effect and can resist various attacks.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly connecting the most intimate parts of our daily lives to the Internet via connected ecosystems of hardware and software products. However, how these ecosystems operate and, in particular their impact on user privacy remains an open question. In this paper, we explore this question by analysing IFTTT, a popular task automation platform based on trigger-action programming. Through IFTTT, end users can easily create applets, aka recipes, that glue different IoT devices and online services together. While IFTTT brings many online services together, such as social media and mobile applications, its use for IoT automation is appealing for many users. Hence, analyzing the IFTTT ecosystem over time, enables us to study IoT trends and adaptation rate in real-user settings. In this paper we describe the IFTTT evolution by analyzing two existing IFTTT data sets and compiling a recent data set of its services and applets. This analysis exposes new platform characteristics and trends. Our data set, which was collected in October 2021, contains data about 694 services, 50898 applets, and 7003 endpoints. It also contains data about the information exchange in the platform via ingredients. In addition, we identify applets that might impose privacy risks for their users by detecting sensitive information flows in the system. We find that almost 30% of installations in the platform involve applets that utilize privacy-sensitive information such as usersâ€™ personal information, location, and health data. This trend is consistently present in the three analyzed data sets and, disturbingly, increases over time.}

	abstract = {In the 5G era, mobile networks gradually become complex, and there are also high requirements for network operation and maintenance. As log data is important information to reflect the status of network devices, the monitoring of log data generated by network devices has become an important part of network operation and maintenance. But the massive amount of log data generated by large-scale network devices has already exceeded the range of human processing capabilities. And the introduction of artificial intelligence algorithms can optimize the detection of log anomalies and reduce network operation and maintenance costs under the challenges of high complexity of 5G networks. This paper proposes a Mahalanobis distance and Pauta criterion based log anomaly detection (MPLAD) algorithm for 5G mobile network. On the basis of solving the shortcomings of the existing log anomaly detection algorithms, it innovatively integrates the Mahalanobis distance algorithm and the Pauta criterion. Meanwhile, it also introduces the negative sample mechanism and the principal component analysis (PCA) method to achieve high accuracy, high efficiency and high compatibility towards 5G mobile network log anomaly detection.}

But these are limited to a theoretical overview. The purpose of this paper is to take malware family classification as an example, to restore and display the malware analysis in real scenarios.In this paper, the measurement of malware family classification is carried out on a large-scale dataset in the real world. We use the BODMAS dataset, which contains a total of 57,293 malware samples, with carefully curated family information (581 families). Referring to the common features (including static features and dynamic features) and machine learning methods mentioned in the review articles, we conduct feature extraction and classification experiments. Then, we summarize the classification results. Static features can efficiently classify a large number of samples, even with 10% packed samples. In real scenarios, the family distribution is extremely unbalanced, and the family classification results with a large number of samples are better. Different evaluation methods have different interpretations of the classification results. These measurement results provide a basis for further malware analysis in real applications.}

	abstract = {We have made research achievements worth sharing on the complicated topic of text-to-image synthesis. Our analysis of popular articles shows that they often use stacked structures to construct and generate confrontation network models and usually introduce multiple sets of generators and discriminator pairs. The entanglement between different generators affects the quality of the final synthesized image. Some researchers have proposed a single-stage network model to avoid traps between multiple generators, But it lacks the use of unstructured natural language information with different granularity. To correct this serious defect, we propose a multi-granularity feature network MGF-GAN, which plays the role of text information with different granularity based on the advantages of the single-stage network. Specifically, we input the three granularity features of the text, including sentences, aspect words, and single words of text, into different stages of the model through spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms to gradually refine the synthetic image from global and local perspectives. In addition, we reconstruct the loss function based on the contrast concept to stabilize the training and ensure that the visual meaning between the synthesized image and the natural language is consistent. We conducted validity experiments on CUB bird and COCO. The significant effect is sufficient to prove the effectiveness and advancement of our MGF-GAN.}

Most existing GNN-based methods model the visual elements in a video as graph structures and reason relations between them. Despite the remarkable results of their work, they neglected that the question also has graph structure dependencies, which can be used to reason about relations between the video and the question. In this work, we propose a multimodal graph reasoning and fusion network that builds three graph neural networks for appearance, motion, and text sequences, respectively, and hierarchically reasons and fuses nodes from different modalities. Our proposed method achieves superior performance to several state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.}

	abstract = {Encrypted proxies, such as Shadowsocks and v2ray, are increasingly used to protect user privacy and circumvent censorship. However, the encryption proxies used by some projects may be subject to configuration error or adversary attack makes the encryption ineffective. The resulted abnormal proxy traffic may expose the userâ€™s real network behavior, resulting in user privacy or confidential information leakage. Meanwhile, it is important for network security regulators to identify specific user behaviors from normal encrypted proxy traffics. However, little effort has been put on fingerprinting the encryption validity of proxy traffic. To this end, we employ several typical deep learning methods including Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and CNN-LSTM to identify proxy traffic, and investigate the performance and the impact of the sample sizes to these methods. A dataset including normal and abnormal proxy traffic from real network environments is generated to evaluate the performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the mentioned deep learning methods can identify abnormal encrypted proxy traffic with the accuracy up to 99.77%. Moreover, LSTM outperform other DL methods on indentifying the specific user behaviors of normal encrypted proxy traffic.}

	abstract = {In the integrated radar communication system using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal as the transmitting signal, the OFDM signal has a significant high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and it is not advantageous to the integrated signal to transmit linearly. To solve the above problem, this paper first proposes an integrated radar communication waveform based on subcarrier multiplexing, which adopts the peak clipping algorithm to suppress the PAPR of the proposed integrated OFDM waveform. Based on the flexible modulation and allocation of subcarriers, some blank subcarriers are reserved to modulate the peak clipping signal to suppress the PAPR with lower complexity and iteration times, which has almost no impact on the bit error rate (BER) of the integrated radar communication waveform. The simulation shows that the proposed suppression method can generate a certain amplitude of peak clipping signal to suppress the excessive signal peak value, greatly suppressing the PAPR of the proposed integrated signal.}

In this manuscript, we focus on the performance analysis of bearings-only geolocation based on constellation of satellites. The geolocation model is firstly established for the scenario of satellites group. Second, angles of arrival (AOAs) in measuring coordinate systems (m-system) for different satellites are established and transformed to the standard earth-centered earth-fixed (ECEF). Then, we derive the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the geolocation precision with the effects of attitude error and position error of satellites. Finally, simulation results are provided to reveal the theoretical performance of bearings-only geolocation based on constellation of satellites.}

	abstract = {The Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of vehicular services have become more and more stringent in intelligent connected vehicles. Hence, the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism has been utilized in IEEE 802.11p to achieve multi-class QoS for the Internet of Vehicles. Recently, some analytical models have been developed to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.11p. Nevertheless, most works are under the assumption of ideal wireless channels and infinite buffer sizes that are not realistic for vehicular networksâ€™ operating environments. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for IEEE 802.11p with bursty error transmission based on the Queuing Theory. Especially, the transmission queue is modelled as an M/G/1/N queueing system. The accuracy of this model has been validated by a set of simulation experiments based on ns-3 and SUMO. The model can be used as a cost-effective tool to investigate the performance of 802.11p under various network conditions.}

	abstract = {In recent years, data security incidents caused by insider threats in distributed file systems have attracted the attention of academia and industry. The most common way to detect insider threats is based on user profiles. Through analysis, we realize that based on existing user profiles are not efficient enough, and there are many false positives when a stable user profile has not yet been formed. In this work, we propose personalized user profiles and design an insider threat detection framework, which can intelligently detect insider threats for securing distributed file systems in real-time. To generate personalized user profiles, we come up with a time window-based clustering algorithm and a weighted kernel density estimation algorithm. Compared with non-personalized user profiles, both the Recall and Precision of insider threat detection based on personalized user profiles have been improved, resulting in their harmonic mean F1 increased to 96.52%. Meanwhile, to reduce the false positives of insider threat detection, we put forward operation recommendations based on user similarity to predict new operations that users will produce in the future, which can reduce the false positive rate (FPR). The FPR is reduced to 1.54% and the false positive identification rate (FPIR) is as high as 92.62%. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks caused by inaccurate authorization for users, we present user tags based on operation content and permission. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can detect insider threats more effectively and precisely, with lower FPR and high FPIR.}

	abstract = {With the development of Internet technology, the number of Internet users increases rapidly, and the amount of data generated on the Internet is very large every day. At the same time, with the development of storage technology and query technology, it is very easy to collect massive data, but the information value contained in these data is uneven, and most of them are unmarked. However, traditional supervised learning has a great demand for labeled samples. Faced with a large number of unlabeled samples, there is a problem of the lack of effective automatic labeling methods, and manual labeling costs are high. If the strategy of simple random sampling is used for annotation, it may lead to the selection of noisy information and waste of resources, and low-quality training data could also have an influence on the prediction accuracy of the model. Meanwhile, the training effect of traditional deep learning methods is very limited for small sample labeled training sets.This paper takes the text emotion analysis task in natural language processing as the background, selects IMDB film review data as the training set and test set, starts with the design of active learning algorithm based on clustering analysis, combined with the appropriate pre-training fine-tuning model, constructs a data enhancement method based on active learning. In the experiment, it is found that when the labeled training set is reduced by 90%, the prediction accuracy of the pre-training model is reduced by no more than 2%, which verifies the effectiveness of the data enhancement method combining active learning with the pre-training model.}

	abstract = {Considering the immutability of traditional blockchain restricts the governance and regulation of sensitive data on chain, this paper proposes a redactable blockchain scheme with k-time controllable cheating editing (CCE-RB for short). In the CCE-RB scheme, the regulator requires editors to generate vector commitments, so as to set the number of times each editorâ€™s editing permissions can be used. The editor needs to open each component of the vector commitment successively before each editor prove that he/she has enough number of times of editing. The regulator has the right to revoke the editorâ€™s editing permission when the editorâ€™s editing times are exhausted or cheating editing behavior occurs, thus realizing the revocability of the editorâ€™s editing permission. In a word, CCE-RB achieves regulation of whole editing process by block editability, controllability of editing times and revocability of editing permissions. By comparing and analyzing related schemes, the experiment results show that CCE-RB scheme has good efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the development of 5G and AI technology, the infectious virus detection framework system based on the combination of 5G MEC and medical sensors can effectively assist in the intelligent detection and control of influenza viruses such as COVID-19. Employing the edge computing and 5G+MEC model, the virus AI model is trained for the collected influenza virus data. Then the virus AI model can be used to evaluate the virus patients on the local edge computing service platform. Therefore, this paper introduces an algorithm and resource allocation, which uses 5G functions (especially, low latency, high bandwidth, wide connectivity, and other functions) to achieve local chest X-ray or CT scan images to detect COVID-19. Meanwhile, this paper also compares the computational efficiency of different algorithms in the 5G edge AI-based infectious virus detection framework, in this way to select the best algorithm and resource allocation.}

	abstract = {Fault detection of point machine operations is discussed in this paper, which is critical for ensuring the safety of a running train.This paper adopts the method of data enhancement and convolutional neural network (CNN) to study and realize the fault diagnosis of power data of switch switch machine. Firstly, six typical fault types and possible fault causes are summarized by analyzing the working process of switch machine and its power curve characteristics. In view of the imbalance of switch data, the synthesized minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is implemented to generate switch fault data and balance switch data set. In view of the low accuracy of turnout fault diagnosis, one-dimensional convolutional neural network is adopted to classify the turnout fault diagnosis model, which further improves the accuracy of turnout fault diagnosis model and provides theoretical support for railway field maintenance. To a certain extent, it overcomes the difficulties of instability and low efficiency of manual turnout fault detection method.}

	abstract = {The high popularity of 5G has spawned a large number of emerging application scenarios and diversified business models, meanwhile, it also leads to the increase in network capacity. The research on 5G network capacity has become an important topic to improve the user perception. This paper analyzes the future capacity trend and development characteristic model of 5G, and then determines the four dimensions for evaluating 5G network capacity. Based on each dimension, this paper locates key indicators, and creatively puts forward the concept of experience satisfaction. Furthermore, this paper researches and recommends the capacity expansion thresholds for 3.5G and 2.1G respectively, using the big data fitting method. In addition, this paper also finds the internal relationship between these key indicators, and give the recommended capacity expansion threshold for each type of cell. A reasonable and accurate capacity expansion threshold is can effectively use the limited capacity expansion investment as well as improve user perception of 5G network.}

As the carrier of local economic development, the transfer of enterprises from one region to another undoubtedly means the loss of regional resources for the region. This paper takes large- scale enterprises as the research object. Then, this paper uses questionnaire data and statistical data, and adopts the combination of PCA algorithm and extreme value standardization method to comprehensively evaluate the loss probability of enterprises. This method will reflect the loss tendency of enterprises in the region, and make an empirical analysis on the large-scale enterprises in region, in this way to help regional managers have an early insight into the loss tendency of enterprises in the region. Finally, it will provide a reference for stabilizing the regional economy and help reduce the loss risk of large-scale enterprises in the region.}

This paper adopts the GBLA-DBSACN (the grid-based local adaptive DBSCAN) algorithm based on the traditional DBSCAN algorithm (Densityâ€”Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise) to improve the accuracy of interference base station (BS) clustering, which considers the dispersion of interference sources. This scheme helps to locate interference problems and potential sources through testing in the existing network quickly and effectively. By taking corresponding optimization means for these problems, network operators can effectively reduce the interference level in the target area and improve the quality of network construction.}

The orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is generally considered as the main candidate waveform for 6G communication.

This paper focuses on OTFS technology, which conveniently adapts to the channel constantly changing via modulating information.

People use mobile phones every day to surf the Internet, shop, socialize, work, etc. In the process of using mobile web services, users may be dissatisfied with the service perception, such as voice connectivity, Internet access, Slow Internet access and other common problems. If the customer is not satisfied with the communication service, the customer can usually complain about the quality of the communication service, so the frequency of the customer complaint has become an important evaluation index for the management of the operator. The quantity and frequency of customers â€˜complaints about telecommunication service are increasing gradually, which brings challenges to the service quality and efficiency of telecommunication operators. This paper presents a methodology for customer complaints.

How to efficiently evaluate the quality of voice service is the focus of telecom operators. This paper proposes an intelligent combined evaluation method of VoLTE and VoNR voice quality based on artificial neural network. In the proposed method, the artificial neural network model is fitted by the call level time slice sample data of voice, and then the prediction model is established. The prediction results of voice quality of mobile networks are obtained by using the prediction model at call level, grid level and area level. Meanwhile, the proposed method can address the shortcomings of traditional evaluation method based on road test, such as high cost, low timeliness and limited area. Finally, through theoretical verification and comparison with the real test results, the effectiveness of the prediction method is verified.}

	abstract = {Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have proven to be a major contributor for the lack of actual deployment and adoption of ML in many practical use-cases. They have been found to be equally lethal in video streams as they are in images and texts. This finds particular relevance in the domain of autonomous driving tasks, which make use of object recognition neural architectures. In this paper, we take a step back from the cat and mouse chase of novel attacks and ad-hoc defenses and try to explain adversarial attacks from the perspective of the geometry of the high-dimensional spaces that the models operate in. Additionally, we make use of our idea of relating adversarial attacks to dimensionality to propose a counter-measure that uses dimension reduction. We have tested our proposition on state-of-the-art object detection and classification models on video streams including Faster-RCNN and YOLO and corresponding adversarial attacks on these models. Having optimally tuned the hyper-parameter associated with variability preservation upon dimension reduction using simple Singular Value Decomposition, we have shown that the performance of the robust version of the object detector models is within 2âˆ’3% of that on the clean samples, despite the presence of adversarial perturbation.}

	abstract = {Source code vulnerability detection is a major goal in security research. In recent years, deep learning methods have been applied to this end, however the task of embedding code into vector representations as input for deep learning models has yet to be definitively solved. The use of graphs, specifically Abstract Syntax Trees and Code Property Graphs, is a promising research direction for this task, however learning from graphs grows prohibitively computationally expensive for large graphs. No close examination of intelligent ways to prune this input to only vulnerability-relevant information has yet been performed. Additionally, most existing works focus largely on structural information from graphs, often neglecting information contained within the nodes themselves. We address these gaps in the prior research by proposing SCEVD: a deep learning model for vulnerability discovery which utilises semantic information to intelligently select features in source code graphs for learning. It uses information contained within code graph nodes, as well as information about their relationships with one another to select the code graph features which are most relevant to code vulnerability. We implement SCEVD and conduct experiments using the SARD Juliet test suite, finding that we are able to improve vulnerability discovery results using this process of semantic-enhanced code graph feature selection.}

	abstract = {A Circuit Breaking Environment (CBE) for Connected Railway Infrastructures (CRI) requires that high sensitive cargos are bound to the transportation train carriges. This implies a continous verification of the connectivity and rapid identification of potenital disconnections. For that purpose we consider signatures run on devices with multiple Hardware Security Modules (HSM) architectures. We propose a modification of BLS signatures with an additive key split augumented with a refresh technique. This protects against a powerful adversary that can control distinct HSMs in different signing sessions. Thus, we consider our scheme to be secure even if the adversary switches between chosen HSMs for leakage of partial secrets, from session to session. Finally, we provide promising results from a proof-of- concept implementation, tested on several different type of low- powered devices for comparison. These indicate the feasibility of our constructions.}

	abstract = {With the development of IoT technology, smart grid has gradually replaced the traditional grid. Smart grid is convenient and fast. It can provide real-time residential electricity monitoring and forecasting, give users better electricity guidance and save a lot of labor costs. Smart meters send customersâ€™ electricity consumption data to the gateway, which aggregates the data and then sends it to the electricity consumption control center. But in this process, there will be a security problem of leakage of customerâ€™s electricity consumption data. Most of the current user data privacy protection collection schemes use homomorphic encryption and randomization techniques. However, some of these schemes require a trusted third-party entity, and some may cause significant computational overhead. Due to the limited computational resources of smart meters, these techniques may be impractical. In this paper, we propose a local differential privacy data aggregation protection scheme based on the idea of grouping perturbation of electricity consumption data according to data domains. Experiments show that our scheme can provide statistical estimates of electricity in the region while satisfying the privacy protection of customersâ€™ electricity consumption data. Moreover, our scheme has small computational and communication overheads, which can meet the application requirements in practical scenarios.}

In LS-LEOSCN, multiple gateway stations need to be deployed to meet user needs, and their location greatly affects system capacity and other performance. Most of the factors considered are delay, hop count or capacity, but most of them do not consider the interference between the feeding links under the giant constellation. In this paper, a capacity evaluation method considering the interference between feeder links is proposed, and based on this capacity evaluation mechanism, a gateway station deployment optimization method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to maximize the system capacity in the case of considering the interference between feeder links. Compared with the randomly generated scheme, the capacity is increased by 6.9% in average.}

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing refers to the employment of workers to complete tasks. Workers will also be rewarded after completing the tasks, which creates two problems. One is how to effectively aggregate the right answers of tasks when the accuracy of workersâ€™ answers varies. The other is how to deal with Sybil attacker, who will get rewards by controlling half or more Sybil workers to influence the Truth Inference. We propose a Truth Discovery with intelligent Sybil defense, called STDEL (Sybil-resistant Truth Discovery by Exploiting the Long-tail Effect). This algorithm can improve the accuracy of Truth aggregation and reduce the rewards by identifying and banning intelligent Sybil workers. Our Experiments on two real world datasets show that STDEL has better performance on accuracy and rewards compared with state-of-the-art Sybil defense Truth Discovery.}

	abstract = {With the rapid progress of the telecom industry and fierce competition among telecom operators, telecom companies pay more attention to customer retention. Telecom companies developed multiple solutions to predict churn customers before customers move to another telecom operator. However, the existing prediction solutions have some disadvantages in the real-world use cases. For example, churn definition is limited to moving from one telecom operator to another, which is too late for preventing customer churn. The main contribution of the paper is to introduce the new definition of customer chum for the telecom industry, and to propose a Half Termination Dynamic Label (HTDL) that improves the churn prediction solution with XGBoost. Experiment results showed that the proposed solution improved the model performance, which significantly outperforms traditional solution, in terms of churn prediction on F1-score. The new solution also sidelines more active customers for retention.}

	abstract = {Threat intelligence on malware attacks and campaigns is increasingly being shared with other security experts for a cost or for free. Other security analysts use this intelligence to inform them of indicators of compromise, attack techniques, and preventative actions. Security analysts prepare threat analysis reports after investigating an attack, an emerging cyber threat, or a recently discovered vulnerability. Collectively known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the reports are typically in an unstructured format and, therefore, challenging to integrate seamlessly into existing intrusion detection systems. This paper proposes a framework that uses the aggregated CTI for analysis and defense at scale. The information is extracted and stored in a structured format using knowledge graphs such that the semantics of the threat intelligence can be preserved and shared at scale with other security analysts. Specifically, we propose the first semi-supervised open-source knowledge graph-based framework, TINKER, to capture cyber threat information and its context. Following TINKER, we generate a Cyberthreat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (CTI-KG) and demonstrate the usage using different use cases.}

	abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems, using particularly Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, is growing rapidly and finding uses in many industries. Most of these industries have critical safety, security, and dependability requirements. Despite this rapid growth, interest in the security of these systems has only arisen in the last few years and it is not yet well-studied. There is a want for a formal notion of security for ML systems, similar to that used in classical information security. We took this statement toward security threat modeling and analysis in ML-based systems, focusing on the adversarial example threat. An adversarial example threat is an input of the classifier that was maliciously modified to induce a misclassification. Identifying this threat at the architecture design stage before proceeding with system development is a critical milestone in the development process of secure ML systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to adversarial example threat specification and detection in component-based software architecture models. We use first-order and modal logic as an abstract and technology-independent formalism. The general idea of the approach is to specify the threat as property of a modeled system such that the violation of the specified property indicates the presence of the threat. We demonstrate the applicability of the method through a classifier used in a recommendation system.}

	abstract = {The majority of mobile devices today are based on Arm architecture that supports the hosting of trusted applications in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). RISC-V is a relatively new open-source instruction set architecture that was engineered to fit many uses. In one potential RISC-V usage scenario, mobile devices could be based on RISC-V hardware. We consider the implications of porting the mobile security stack on top of a RISC-V system on a chip, identify the gaps in the open-source Keystone framework for building custom TEEs, and propose a security architecture that, among other things, supports the GlobalPlatform TEE API specification for trusted applications. In addition to Keystone enclaves the architecture includes a Trusted Hart â€“ a normal core that runs a trusted operating system and is dedicated for security functions, like control of the deviceâ€™s keystore and the management of secure peripherals. The proposed security architecture for RISC-V platform is verified experimentally using the HiFive Unleashed RISC-V development board.}

	abstract = {Security and privacy became vital to any of the current computational systems or applications. Particularly, investigating possible security issues - to mitigate possible data leaks or tampering - is an important step in the current software development. Currently, penetration tests (pentest) are performed to detect possible system flaws and to prevent/correct eventual security issues. However pentesting (the act of performing pentest) a system can be complex and hard to control. There are many activities throughout the pentesting process and it is common to find difficulties in controlling them. At the same time, it is not easy to determine precisely what activities will be performed, since each tester can follow a specific methodology or even use their own testing model. Based on the main security assessment test methodologies, we created a framework for penetration testing that aims to improve the test workflow in terms of management, organization, standardization, and flexibility. This framework is called Tramonto. This paper presents and discusses a pentest case study performed by a security company using the Tramonto framework. To present this case, we introduce the Tramonto-App, a software that was implemented using the definitions present in the Tramonto framework. Tramonto-App was designed to assist testers in penetration tests based on features that help to organize scripts, handle the testing workflow, and generate reports. As a result, the Tramonto-App resulted in a reduced number of pentesting problems and reduced (human) effort required to perform the penetration, allowing the tester to improve the quality of the Pentest.}

	abstract = {This paper mines user behavior characteristics based on big data technology. This paper proposes a method for behavior slicing based on historical activity data, and insights into the personalized behavior characteristics. Firstly, the data is processed, and the classification is expanded on the basis of the parsed APP label types. Secondly, a time slicing method is proposed to reduce information loss, which integrates time, location, business type, and behavior into individual users. Then, based on slices of a day and a week, the paper analyzes user behavior and construct a portrait of userâ€™s interest and preference. Finally, the periodic factor method is utilized to predict the behavior changes, forming the feature labels for users. Based on real business behaviors, this paper provides insight into user personality and effectively improves the authenticity and accuracy of prediction.}

	abstract = {Recently, vehicle classification is becoming increasingly important with the development of automated driving technology. In particular, it can provide the basis and prerequisites for autonomous vehicles to make decisions in terms of improving driving safety. However, the current mainstream vehicle classification methods are deep learning algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are mainly focused on the cloud, and these algorithms have complex models and large training parameters. In addition, for computationally intensive and urgent tasks, the poor computational power and low storage capabilities of edge nodes cannot support CNN-based vehicle classification algorithms for model updating. In this paper, we propose a lightweight vehicle classification method with mobile edge computing based on Broad Learning System (BLS). On the one hand, the vehicle can serve as a mobile edge computing node to provide computing and storage resources to ensure that classification tasks are performed locally and quickly, avoiding the bandwidth congestion caused by uploading to the cloud. On the other hand, we use broad learning method to perform incremental training on the data, which is more suitable for computing at the edge, because it can support incremental updates to the model on the vehicular edge nodes without retraining the whole model. Experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi system to simulate edge nodes, the results show with a similar performance, the training speed of our vehicle classification system can be increased by 10 times compared with the other CNN-based algorithms.}
