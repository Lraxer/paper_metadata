	abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) were developed to secure and attest software executed in the cloud. Current TEEs provide remote attestation of the initial software state but no mechanisms to natively and remotely analyze their internal memory during execution. We introduce MAXPOWR, a novel protocol for secure memory offloading in process-based TEEs during runtime. Our proposed solution is technology agnostic, requires only user space privileges, and works despite a compromised target process. Our concept secures the memory offload for remote analysis by enforcing temporary computational exhaustion on the system under test using Proof-of-Work challenges. We provide a PoC for Intel SGX consisting of less than 500 LoC. Our results demonstrate a less complex, though equally secure technique for memory introspection compared to the state-of-the-art. MAXPOWR requires a constant clock frequency and, therefore, assumes an honest-but-curious cloud provider.}

	abstract = {In complex environments such as maritime search and rescue, the application of drone swarms has significantly improved the efficiency of search and rescue and effectively reduced the risk of casualties. However, they face serious security and privacy challenges, particularly when dealing with internal malicious node attacks and communication security threats, which can lead to leakage or tampering of rescue information, severely affecting the effectiveness of rescue operations and the safety of participants. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative trustworthy drone networking framework that integrates trusted domain construction and information synchronization technologies. Firstly, a reputation-based voting mechanism is designed to ensure that only drones with good reputations are granted access to the trusted domain, thereby enhancing the overall credibility and reliability of the network. next, an improved lattice-based aggregate signature algorithm is developed for the information synchronization scheme, ensuring the authenticity of information and the integrity of data, effectively preventing information leakage and tampering. Through experimental validation, the proposed trustworthy drone networking framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing solutions in promptly detecting and responding to malicious attacks, with efficiency improved by 10%. Additionally, the designed aggregate signature algorithm successfully reduces time costs by approximately 9.16%, providing maritime search and rescue operations with more efficient, accurate, and secure communication support.}

	abstract = {Secure migration of multi-tenant containerized cloud servers is critical to maintaining the stability and security of cloud services. However, migrating applications across servers owned by different platforms introduces a range of security challenges. Recent research indicates that Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide effective hardware-based isolation for containers, significantly enhancing data confidentiality and integrity. Despite these advancements, existing technologies still struggle to ensure consistency during the migration of container data. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive security migration framework that defines the security properties required for container migration and introduces a software-based solution. This solution integrates several technologies, including a secure removal mechanism utilizing monotonic counters to prevent potential fork/rollback attacks and ensure the single-instance nature of migrated containers. Additionally, a two-phase commit-based pre-migration check mechanism is employed to maintain consistency among tightly coupled containers being migrated simultaneously on the same host. Safety analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed design, and performance evaluation indicates an additional overhead of approximately 7%.}

	abstract = {Aiming at reducing the embedding distortion and improving tamper localization accuracy, a semi-fragile reversible watermarking for 3D models based on IQIM (improved quantization index modulation) with dual-strategy partition modulation is proposed. Firstly, watermark is built based on the position data of vertices and the number of neighboring vertices within the first ring. With IQIM, a dual-strategy partition based on the relationship between the position of quantization coefficients within quantization units and the watermark information is built. It performs single or dual modulation of IQIM to vertices, which is helpful for reducing the distortion induced by watermark embedding in the 3D models. During watermark extraction and data recovery, the watermark is first extracted based on the model vertex information and the original watermark is regenerated. The dual-strategy partition is performed based on the relationship between the position of quantization coefficient within quantization units and the regenerated watermark. Then, the model vertices are respectively recovered. Finally, by comparing the consistency between the extracted and regenerated watermarks, the integrity of the 3D model can be authenticated and the tampered area can be located. The experiments and analysis show that it outperforms several cutting-edge techniques from the aspects of embedding distortion and tamper localization capability.}

	abstract = {Traditional microkernel-based operating systems are popular in embedded and safety-critical applications due to their advantages in security, reliability, and scalability. In recent years, some OS projects like LionsOS and the Hong-Meng microkernel have focused on developing general-purpose operating systems based on microkernels. However, the strong isolation mechanisms of microkernel architectures often lead to performance degradation when implementing user-space system services. This is particularly evident in file systems, where data may need to be transferred across multiple system services, resulting in redundant data copying. To address this issue, this paper proposes a microkernel file system architecture based on a multi-server memory proxy, which reduces redundant data copying across processes in a multi-server design through centralized shared memory. Additionally, this architecture effectively abstracts the use of Direct Memory Access (DMA), allowing any process to securely and conveniently utilize DMA for zerocopy operations. Considering the high-reliability requirements of system services, we implemented the overall design using the Rust programming language, thus avoiding the security issues typically associated with traditional languages like C. Experimental results indicate that our design can enhance file buffered I/O throughput performance by 43%.}

	abstract = {Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) is a widely adopted data collection method that utilizes ubiquitous mobile devices as sensors. The centralized nature of traditional MCS introduces certain weaknesses, leading to a growing interest in blockchainbased MCS. Although decentralized MCS proves to be effective, it also presents several privacy and trust concerns. Specifically, ensuring node trust authentication in an anonymous and decentralized manner is critical due to the susceptibility of a trustworthy and decentralized MCS platform to various attacks. Nevertheless, the absence of a centralized and trusted entity in blockchain poses significant challenges in managing node keys for authentication. Moreover, trust often conflicts with privacy, and the transparency of blockchain further complicates the achievement of anonymous authentication while preserving privacy. To address these challenges, we propose a scheme for decentralized anonymous authentication based on threshold and partial blind signature, which provides a key alternation service. The proposed scheme enables trust credential issuance without disclosing the linkable relationship between the public keys before and after the alternation. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme.}

However, CNN architectures underperform in capturing long-term temporal dependencies. This paper investigates methods to enhance the effectiveness of website fingerprinting attacks by improving the model while striving to conserve computational resources. We introduce a Compact Convolutional Transformer Website Fingerprinting (CTWF) attack model. The CTWF model is specifically designed for Tor anonymous traffic, fully leveraging the Transformer to capture temporal dependencies and utilizing the sequence of Tor cell bursts to compress input. It features a streamlined architecture with convolutional token extraction layers and sequence pooling layers for efficient attack modeling. We evaluated the effectiveness of the CTWF attack in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our results show that CTWF significantly outperforms the most advanced attack models, with and without time drift and defenses.}

	abstract = {Insider threats pose a significant risk to organizational security due to their covert nature and potential to cause substantial harm, often leading to severe operational losses. A key challenge in detecting insider threats is the scarcity of abnormal behavior samples, which leads to a significant imbalance between normal and abnormal data in training sets. This imbalance distorts the model’s learning process, making it more likely to recognize normal behavior while overlooking or misclassifying anomalies. To address this issue, we propose a novel data generation method based on the Diffusion-TS model, named LSTM-Diff. Our approach begins with a multi-layer LSTM network that deeply analyzes user behavior sequences, capturing multi-scale features that include both short-term variations and long-term trends. Subsequently, based on Diffusion-TS, the model generates data by systematically introducing and then reducing noise to produce diverse abnormal behavior data. Additionally, by incorporating Fourier transform, the model simulates the periodic patterns in user behavior, producing realistic abnormal user data that effectively balances the ratio between normal and abnormal samples. Finally, we employed an LSTM model with a cross-entropy loss function for insider threat detection. Validation on the CERT 4.2 dataset demonstrated that the LSTM-Diff method significantly improved the detection capability for insider threats, achieving an accuracy of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.92.}

	abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are essential for securing sensitive data by isolating it from potentially vulnerable execution environments. In ARM-based devices, TEEs utilize TrustZone technology to create a secure world for Trusted Applications (TAs) and a normal world for Client Applications (CAs), ensuring strict isolation through hardware mechanisms. Despite this protection, current TEE systems lack robust mechanisms for securing TA access, leaving them vulnerable to attacks that exploit cross-world communication channels.This paper introduces SeChannel, a lightweight solution for securing communication channels in TrustZone-assisted TEEs. Unlike existing methods, SeChannel requires no additional hardware and avoids the performance penalties of encryption and memory copying. By leveraging existing ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF), SeChannel implements fine-grained access control to ensure that communication between CAs and TAs is authenticated and protected. It verifies shared memory addresses and TA sessions, preventing unauthorized access by the Rich OS. We implement a prototype of SeChannel on the Hikey960 development board with minimal code modifications to the existing system. Our evaluation demonstrates that SeChannel significantly enhances the security of TrustZone-assisted TEEs with negligible performance overhead.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on addressing the challenges of detecting malicious attacks in networks by designing an advanced Explainable Intrusion Detection System (xIDS). The existing machine learning and deep learning approaches have invisible limitations, such as potential biases in predictions, a lack of interpretability, and the risk of overfitting to training data. These issues can create doubt about their usefulness, and transparency, and decrease the trust of involved stakeholders. To overcome these challenges, we propose an ensemble learning technique called the "EnsembleGuard". This approach uses the predicted outputs of multiple models, including tree-based (LightGBM, GBM, Bagging, XGBoost, CatBoost) and deep learning models such as neural network (LSTM (long short-term memory networks) and GRU (gated recurrent unit), to maintain a balance and achieve trustworthy results. Our work is unique because it combines both tree-based and deep learning models to design an interpretable and explainable meta-model through model distillation. By considering the predictions of all individual models, our neta-model effectively addresses key challenges, and ensures both explainable and reliable results. We evaluate our model using well-known datasets, including UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and CIC-IDS-2017, to assess its reliability against various types of attacks. During analysis, we found that our model outperforms both tree-based models and other comparative approaches when it comes to different kinds of attack scenarios.}

	abstract = {In virtualized systems, guest Virtual Machines (VM) often have direct access to I/O devices for performance reasons, rather than using paravirtualized devices. However, this leads to a potential isolation breach due to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) capabilities of I/O devices assigned to these VMs. In such a configuration, a guest VM could instruct one of its DMA-capable I/O devices to transfer data to a memory location that the VM itself is not authorized to access. It is widely acknowledged that this isolation breach can be mitigated thanks to the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU), which enforces access control on the DMA-capable peripherals to the main memory. Despite being mentioned for nearly two decades, this threat remains persistent, particularly due to the increasing adoption of virtualization in the field of embedded systems, where the target platforms often have no IOMMU. In addition, even when an IOMMU is present, DMA attacks can still be carried out due to various limitations which depend on the context, the underlying hypervisor, and the platform. This paper aims to raise awareness of the persistence of DMA attack threats within the context of embedded systems virtualization. It discusses why the requirements and constraints in this field make this threat still widespread and effective. It depicts a straightforward DMA attack in a common environment where a VM has direct access to a DMA-capable peripheral, showing the severity, applicability, and ease of implementation of such an attack. This paper also explores the potential ARM-based embedded platforms impacted, along with the available mitigation strategies and their current limitations.}

	abstract = {Image steganography aims to conceal secret messages within an image without detection and has a long development history. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, generative image steganography is also thriving. However, existing generative steganography methods struggle to balance steganographic capacity, extraction accuracy, and security. This paper proposes a high-capacity generative steganography method based on the first-order DPM-Solver, called StegaFDS. By utilizing our efficiently designed mapping function, which connects secret messages to the noise space of the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM), we achieve a significant increase in hiding capacity and detection resistance, while maintaining distribution-preserving. To improve message extraction accuracy further, we also optimize the existing first-order DPM-Solver inversion. Additionally, based on pre-trained diffusion models, StegaFDS can generate high-quality stego images without training. Experimental results show that StegaFDS performs exceptionally better than other generative steganography methods in the abovementioned metrics and demonstrates strong potential and availability.}

	abstract = {Red teams simulate adversaries and conduct sophisticated attacks against defenders without informing them about used tactics in advance. These interactive cyber exercises are highly beneficial to assess and improve the security posture of organizations, detect vulnerabilities, and train employees. Unfortunately, they are also time-consuming and expensive, which often limits their scale or prevents them entirely. To address this situation, adversary emulation tools partially automate attacker behavior and enable fast, continuous, and repeatable security testing even when involved personnel lacks red teaming experience. Currently, a wide range of tools designed for specific use-cases and requirements exist. To obtain an overview of these solutions, we conduct a review and structured comparison of nine open-source adversary emulation tools. To this end, we assemble a questionnaire with 80 questions addressing relevant aspects, including setup, support, documentation, usability, and technical features. In addition, we conduct a user study with domain experts to investigate the importance of these aspects for distinct user roles. Based on the evaluation and user feedback, we rank the tools and find MITRE Caldera, Metasploit, and Atomic Red Team on top.}

In this work we propose a novel approach to building secure UI screens based on DRM system and demonstrate its feasibility on Android for transaction authentication use case. Security of our solution is based on a TEE thus making it resilient against privileged malware. Additionally, we introduce a detection mechanism for overlay attacks based on random background patterns. Our approach does not require any system customization and is deployable on a wide range of COTS devices. The usability of the proposed solution was validated by means of an online survey, which indicated high detection rate of overlay attacks. Aside of simple transaction authentication, similar to the Android Protected Confirmation (APC) but with a wider device support, our approach can be used to realize more general applications, for instance, secure voting input screen, document viewing, confidential news reading and social media clients, providing high security against spyware or remote forensics investigations.}

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) significantly enhances organizational cybersecurity defenses by providing actionable insights from diverse data sources. This research studies the correlation between CTI analysis and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, focusing on their alignment to strengthen threat detection and response capabilities. A pivotal aspect of this study involves developing a classifier using a fine-tuned BERT-based model to map CTI reports to specific ATT&CK techniques. Our model demonstrated substantial improvements over the baseline SecBERT, achieving a 2.6% higher F1-score and a 4.2% improvement in Top-3 Accuracy. By integrating CTI with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, researchers can shift from reactive to proactive cybersecurity strategies. This integration enables swift detection of emerging threats, enhances incident response effectiveness, and fortifies defensive measures against evolving cyber threats. Ultimately, the synergy between CTI and ATT&CK fosters a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity management in today’s dynamic threat landscape.}

	abstract = {Certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its ability to address the complex certificate management requirements inherent in public key infrastructure (PKI) systems and the key escrow issue associated with identity-based cryptography (IBC). However, the efficient revocation of illegitimate users in authentication schemes based on CL-PKC remains a challenge. Moreover, certain schemes still exhibit security vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to key replacement attacks, and also require performance enhancements. In this article, we propose a novel certificateless signature scheme that incorporates the RSA accumulator. By leveraging the witness in the RSA accumulator to produce the public keys of users, the authenticity of the public key can be efficiently verified, thereby eliminating key replacement attacks. Additionally, by removing specific elements from the RSA accumulator and broadcasting the update credential to legitimate users via a public channel, our proposed scheme allows the effective revocation of malicious users. Security analysis and performance evaluations indicate that our scheme provides comprehensive security and achieves high performance in terms of computational and communication costs in both signingverification and revocation processes.}

	abstract = {Contemporary research often addresses the face anti-spoofing challenge through a classification paradigm. However, due to the rapidly changing and diverse characteristics of spoofing faces, it is unreasonable to regard all spoofing faces as a single category. Moreover, the swift evolution of spoofing techniques can render trained detectors ineffective. Anomaly detection offers a solution to these challenges by training exclusively on normal samples, distinguishing living samples as normal and non-living samples as anomalies. This paper presents a novel face anti-spoofing approach grounded in anomaly detection. It devises an RGB-D dual-stream network architecture that integrates multi-scale features from RGB and depth modalities via intermediate fusion. In addition, it also incorporates adversarial learning to facilitate network training. Furthermore, it proposes a novel multi-stage anomaly score generation technique for face anti-spoofing. Our experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over comparative approaches.}

	abstract = {The classification of malicious families is essential in Android malware analysis. However, inconsistent naming standards across different antivirus companies hinder accurate identification and understanding of malicious behaviors. This study conducts an extensive analysis of Android malware families to address these challenges. First, we compared family definitions from various antivirus companies and found significant inconsistencies in the level of detail and descriptions of malicious behaviors. These inconsistencies undermine effective malware classification and analysis. Second, we assessed the alignment between described and exhibited malicious behaviors, revealing that family definitions often provide only a broad outline, omitting critical details. Additionally, evolving malware behaviors often surpass existing family definitions. To address these issues, we propose using specific behavior labels to directly indicate malicious behaviors in malware attack chains. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a detailed analysis of Android malicious behaviors, we identified six key behavior labels. To streamline the labeling process, we designed the AMBL frame-work, which automates the generation of behavior labels for malware. Our novel feedback mechanism-based LLM analysis method establishes relationships between APIs and behavior labels, crucial for accurate label updating. Through AMBL, a dataset with behavior analysis reports has been outputed and open sourced. An online survey and manual analysis are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the AMBL framework and the reliability of the dataset.}

	abstract = {The swift advancement of internet technologies has had profound effects across numerous sectors, placing cyber-security at the forefront of concerns for both businesses and governmental entities. Effective cyber risk assessment enables network administrators to reinforce their defenses against cyber attacks and mitigate potential losses. However, traditional approaches frequently concentrate solely on either the difficulty of exploiting vulnerabilities or the topological characteristics of attack graphs, and some require knowledge of the attacker’s strategies. This paper presents a novel network risk assessment methodology that combines cooperative game theory with host probabilistic Attack Graphs, called RACAG. Specifically, Shapley values is employed to provide an unbiased assessment the impact of each attack path on the overall system damage. The proposed approach does not require any prior knowledge of the attacker’s strategies but instead focuses on comprehensive analysis of the exploit difficulty of vulnerabilities in the system, asset information, network topology, and attacker traces detected by defense mechanisms. Experiments have confirmed the efficacy of RACAG in assessing the impact of attack paths on overall system damage. Additionally, they highlighted its advantages in the deployment of deceptive resources, enhancement of risk perception abilities, and its support for defenders in analyzing smokescreen tactic.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has gained increasing popularity in today’s privacy-focused world due to its ability to break data silos. Although federated learning can keep all the training data private at each site, it results in clients not being effectively monitored, which may pose security risks to the learning process. Previous studies mainly focus on backdoor and poisoning attacks against federated learning. In this paper, we propose a new stegomalware attack in FL, where an attacker, disguised as a benign client, hides malware into his local model and distributes the malware to other clients through the FL process. Conducting such an attack faces two challenges. First, embedding data into a local model may degrade its model performance, making it easier for a server in FL to detect this anomaly. Second, the local model with embedded malware is recalculated after model aggregation, which unavoidably alters the malware’s carrier and hinders the success of malware extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a method called StegoFL to incorporate steganography into federated learning to transmit malware. Specifically, we split the malware to be transmitted into segments and randomly select a few model parameters as carriers. Each malware segment is concealed within these carriers over several training rounds. We also propose a simple value-mapping method to extract the embedded data by comparing the aggregated carrier values with a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that StegoFL can circumvent server-side detection mechanisms, i.e., accuracy tests and parametric distribution comparisons. In addition, it increases transmission capacity by at least 50 times compared to state-of-the-art covert communication methods in federated learning.}

	abstract = {Administrative Role-Based Access Control (AR-BAC) was proposed to enhance the convenience and scalability of RBAC administration. In ARBAC, the trusted security administrator can delegate the ability to perform administrative actions to semi-untrusted users by defining an ARBAC policy. This introduces potential data leakage risks: the semi-trusted users may exploit their administrative capabilities to enable unauthorized access. To prevent such risks, an automated tool named Mohawk was proposed to analyze the safety of the User-role Assignment (URA) policy, a part of ARBAC policy that imposes restrictions on the modification of user-role relationships. Given a URA policy, Mohawk can verify whether a system can transit to a state where a role is assigned to an unauthorized user. In detail, Mohawk transforms the URA-safety analysis problem into a state-reachability problem and uses a model checker to solve it. Further, Mohawk designs two techniques, abstraction refinement and bound estimation, to improve analysis efficiency. In the portion of bound estimation, Mohawk estimates six upper bounds to reduce the size of the search space for state transition paths. However, we found that three of them are incorrect. In this article, we first provide a counterexample to show the error, and then give an upper bound and rigorously prove its correctness.}

	abstract = {Federated learning has become the leading paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning, as it only requires the upload of model gradients, not private data. However, recent studies have shown that these exchanged gradients can still lead to privacy leakage; for instance, attackers can recover private images through optimization-based gradient inversion attacks. In these attacks, pixel values in a dummy image are iteratively updated to approximate those of the private image. Yet, such optimization-based attacks often face challenges due to the large search space of the optimization task and struggle to accurately recover all labels in a batch. To tackle these, we propose the Optimization-based Feature-Level Gradient Inversion (OFLGI) attack, which focuses on optimizing image features rather than pixel values. This approach reduces the search space of the optimization task and enhances the quality of the reconstructed images. Our method formulates an optimization task to convert random noise features into natural image features, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. Notably, we are the first to utilize image features for gradient inversion attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel batch label reconstruction algorithm that leverages the gradients of the biases in the final fully connected layer, surpassing existing methods even in the presence of duplicate labels. Furthermore, OFLGI demonstrates superior resistance to multiple gradient defense strategies, being able to recover high-quality private images even from degraded gradients. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of OFLGI over state-of-the-art gradient inversion techniques.}

	abstract = {Sharding is one of the prominent solutions to solve the scalability problem of traditional blockchains. By dividing the blockchain network into independent shards, transactions in different shards can be executed in parallel, improving the throughput of the blockchain. However, sharding also brings security issues. In a hash-based transaction sharding system, the output shard of a transaction is determined by the hash value of the transaction. Unfortunately, we show that this hashbased transaction assignment strategy can be easily exploited by attackers to conduct front-running attacks. Attackers can take advantage of the execution differences between different shards and the extra processing time of cross-shard transactions to make the attacker’s transaction executed and committed before the victim’s transaction, thereby obtaining the benefits that originally belonged to the victim. We also propose a flooding front-running attack, which introduces a single-shard flooding attack to enhance the front-running attack. Specifically, injecting a large number of junk transactions into the shard where the victim’s transaction is located can significantly extend the execution time of the victim’s transaction. We demonstrate the feasibility and practical effects of these two attacks through experiments on RapidChain, which show that a single-shard flooding attack can increase the success rate of a front-running attack by 12%. Finally, we discuss two possible mitigation measures and the cost of two proposed attacks.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) technologies, security and privacy issues associated with IoV data sharing have become increasingly prominent. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes offer effective solutions to these problems, the prevalent single-point failure vulnerabilities and risks of user privacy leakage in existing ABE schemes must be addressed. To this end, an original hidden policy scheme based on multi-authority ciphertext policy ABE is proposed. This scheme validates users by introducing multiple attribute authorities and generating intermediate attribute keys, effectively dispersing single-point performance pressure. Simultaneously, partial policy-hiding techniques are developed to ensure efficient system operation while protecting user privacy. Furthermore, this scheme introduces a central authority to track potentially malicious attribute authorities, preventing them from continuously generating incorrect attribute intermediate keys, thereby maintaining the overall security of the system. Additionally, by updating and revoking attribute versions, a flexible attribute revocation mechanism is achieved to further enhance system flexibility. Through in-depth security and performance analyses, the scheme is proven to be both secure and efficient for securing IoV.}

	abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) is an emerging binary instruction set architecture designed for secure binary program execution and is rapidly being deployed across various security-critical domains, such as edge computing and smart contracts. However, despite its security-oriented design, Wasm remains susceptible to vulnerabilities, including integer overflows and memory corruption, due to the lack of effective protection mechanisms, which undermines its security guarantees.In this paper, we present WaShadow, the first approach for effective Wasm protection using virtual machine-aware shadow memory. Our key insight is that, since Wasm is a virtual instruction set, we can leverage memory layout information in the underlying Wasm VMs to enforce the protection. Specifically, we first extend the Wasm VMs with shadow memory to record memory information and track the status of linear memory, by introducing two new pseudo Wasm instructions for inserting and performing sanity checks on canaries in the linear memory. We then design a static binary instrumentation method to instrument Wasm binaries with canary instructions. Finally, we implement these canary pseudo-instructions through virtual machine extensions as well as a set of vulnerability detection algorithms as security plugins. We implemented a software prototype for WaShadow and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, usability, and overhead on micro and real-world benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrated that WaShadow is effective in protecting Wasm linear memory against various memory vulnerabilities, with an average code size increase of 26.5% and an execution time penalty of 108.5%.}

This work uses the case of electromagnetic attacks on encryption services in real-world SBCs to explore how various preprocessing methods can reduce the attack costs for such devices. Specifically, we propose a general preprocessing framework that effectively combines multiple preprocessing methods based on their inherent characteristics. Utilizing this framework, we design a four-layer preprocessing scheme that significantly reduces the number of traces for key recovery. The experimental results show that, when the attack success rate reaches 80 percent, the proposed preprocessing scheme reduces the number of traces required by a factor of approximately 10 compared to the latest alignment algorithm on the Raspberry Pi 2B.

	abstract = {Container escape detection is a critical research topic in the field of cloud security. Among the challenges faced in modern cloud security, the issue of container escape poses a significant threat due to its direct impact on the security of the host machine. Although recent research has proposed various methods to address such issue, they have shortcomings in terms of real-time capabilities and deployment in multinode environments. Meanwhile, container network interface (CNI) plugins provide network functionality for container management systems such as Kubernetes, offering ease of use and scalability. Therefore, we propose CPCED, a real-time container escape detection system running on a generic CNI plugin, and implement the prototype. The system defines the container namespace event that is used to detect insecure interactions by monitoring its changes in the permissions of the process namespace. To detect the events, an algorithm is proposed to extract suspicious process paths and command context in Kubernetes and Docker environments. The experimental results show that this system detects nine container escape vulnerabilities successfully. Compared to PACED, one of the real-time container escape attack detection systems, the memory usage of CPCED is reduced by 7.6% on average, and the average detection time of single vulnerability is 18.6% of PACED’s.}

	abstract = {The continuous advancement of digital processes has significantly increased the risk to users’ data privacy. To protect private data, it is crucial to provide anonymous, anti-tracking secure communication services. However, Existing anti-tracking data transmission technologies has problems such as centralized node, unstable links, low transmission efficiency, and vulnerable static transmission, which fail to meet users’ privacy and security requirements. This paper proposes a dynamic asymmetric hierarchical architecture path generation method(DAHP) for anti-tracking network. The method adopts a hierarchical architecture design, comprising a Secure Access Layer responsible for link construction and a Secret Transmission Layer handling the actual transmission. A node hybrid selection strategy, combined with a dynamic asymmetric path generation strategy, minimizes the risk of node exposure and enables dynamic variation in path generation. The efficacy of the DAHP method is validated through extensive testing on representative network and existing path generation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior scalability and anti-tracking performance.}

However, the feasibility of developing flow correlation methods specifically for Tor onion services remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose TOScorr, an effective deep learning-based flow correlation attack that enables high-precision deanonymization of onion service sessions. To accommodate the high variability of onion service traffic, TOScorr uses aggregated features of flow pairs as robust inputs and employs a novel encoding module with Transformer self-attention mechanisms added to capture information embedded in both local and global contexts. Experimental results show that TOScorr is more scalable and practically effective in correlating onion services compared to previous methods.}

	abstract = {With the rapid evolution of deep learning (DL), its integration in encrypted traffic classification (ETC) can automatically extract key features from raw traffic data, enhancing classification performance. So far, researchers have proposed many DL-based models for ETC. However, the complexity and dynamism of network applications lead to the diversification of ETC tasks. Current models, mostly tailored for single tasks, overlook real-world multi-tasking needs of network devices. Deploying task-specific complex models concurrently on resource-limited devices is impractical. In response to the increasing number of tasks, researchers have introduced multi-task learning frameworks for ETC, demonstrating its potential as a promising technical approach. However, current research overlooks the interference between tasks, resulting in flawed models when it comes to sharing parameters, setting learning rates, and determining loss values. Aiming at these deficiencies, we propose  \\mathcal{M} \\mathcal{M} -ETC, a multi-task ETC method reducing inter-task interference. The innovation of  \\mathcal{M} \\mathcal{M} -ETC lies in two aspects. Firstly, we design a hierarchical multi-task learning model (HMLM) to provide effective features for each task and prevent the impact of invalid features. Secondly, we propose a learning rate balancing strategy (LRB) for modules and a dynamic weight average strategy (DWA) for tasks’ loss values. During model training, LRB prevents overfitting and underfitting of tasks, while DWA prevents bias towards tasks with large loss values. To validate  \\mathcal{M} \\mathcal{M} -ETC, we carry out comparative experiments using four encrypted traffic datasets. The experimental results show that the classification performance of  \\mathcal{M} \\mathcal{M} -ETC on multiple tasks exceeds those of five state-of-the-art methods.}

Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) models may be distributed to users with varying security levels, necessitating distinct visualizations for each user. Recent research proposes 3D model encryption method that facilitates distinct visualizations post-decryption through hierarchical decryption. However, this method permits the decryption of 3D models at varying visual security levels based on user privileges. It has potential security vulnerabilities concerning key management and simultaneously limits its capacity to address diverse user requirements. To address this, a multi-stage secret sharing mechanism is integrated into the existing hierarchical encryption framework to bolster the security of hierarchical keys. When combined with lattice-based cryptography techniques, it ensures that only users with adequate shares can decrypt the corresponding 3D model hierarchy, achieving distinct visual effects while maintaining secret key security under diverse user needs. Experimental results demonstrate that the scheme effectively enhances security while maintaining data integrity and availability.}

However, recent approaches still face significant communication overhead and data loss. This presents challenges in incrementally managing changes in data features due to the dynamic nature of heterogeneous networks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-compressed vertical federated learning approach. Our approach leverages the data features of multiple networks while ensuring that only embedding vectors and gradients are exchanged, preventing the training data from leaving the local network. Additionally, we introduce a sparse representation enhancement for the embedding and gradient vectors to minimize communication costs and training time.

	abstract = {Cyber-attacks are increasing; it is more urgent for organizations to automate their Incident Response (IR) plan process. Attack Graphs (AGs) are used to represent actions followed by an adversary to reach a goal. However, an expert should analyze each possible action and their impact to decide which mitigation actions should be applied to block the attack fulfillment. This paper proposes an approach to generate Attack-Defense Graphs in real-time by instantiating IR actions on a logical AG. The system’s real-time monitoring enables the detection of malicious actions, which leads to the generation of alerts mapped with the AG to deduce the attacker’s location on the system. Our solution can decide where to apply IR actions to mitigate the attack impact. These IR actions are part of playbooks that are generated automatically for the attack. We propose correlating IR actions with the AG fact nodes to choose which IR actions to instantiate on the AG. Therefore, we propose generating predicates for the mitigation actions, which are mapped with the AG predicates. We validate our approach with an industrial use case. An asset is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) requiring user credentials that can be obtained through a brute force attack. We show how our approach helps anticipate an adversary’s next step. The countermeasures predicates are instantiated on the AG to prevent the attacker from going further on the system.}

However, most existing methods for encrypted traffic classification rely heavily on supervised learning, requiring large amounts of labeled data, and struggle to perform effectively in complex and dynamic network environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised method for encrypted traffic classification, which analyzes byte rate variations to capture traffic behavior patterns. Our approach does not require prior knowledge or large volumes of labeled data, enabling adaptive processing of encrypted traffic in complex network conditions. Specifically, we introduce a noise-resilient shape-line extraction method that preserves core behavioral characteristics of traffic; we design a multidimensional feature extraction strategy that analyzes both uplink and downlink features; and we propose an unsupervised classification algorithm that combines shape-based density clustering with a feature assignment strategy. This algorithm overcomes the limitations of traditional methods, such as the need for predefined cluster numbers, and can classify unknown traffic patterns. We validate our method on five real-world traffic datasets with differing levels of openness, demonstrating its remarkable robustness and accuracy in encrypted traffic classification tasks, thereby greatly enhancing the precision and stability of service classification.}

	abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of underground cybercrime communities in the cyber ecosystem, identifying illegal SIM card vendors can reveal their organizational structure and expose their behavioral patterns, allowing for early warning and improving countermeasures’ efficiency. With the rapid development of machine learning and deep learning technologies, natural language processing techniques have been widely applied. When identifying card vendors, most research has been limited to representing text features from a single dimension and data source. Therefore, we proposed a method to discover card vendor cliques based on multi-source data. The process includes: first, analyzing and constructing the card vendor ontology model to store data from the group chat, forum, and dialogue. Second, extract the attributes of the card vendor entities based on the rotary positional encoding with the BiLSTM model, building the intelligence database. Third, the intelligence database is embedded into vectors based on the GNN and autoencoder for further card vendor cliques discovery. After constructing the intelligence database consisting of 3,792 nodes and 25,602 relationships, our method successfully discovered 12 card vendor cliques, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.}

	abstract = {JavaScript is rapidly being deployed as binaries in security-critical embedded domains, including IoT devices, edge computing, and smart automotive applications. Ensuring the security of JavaScript binaries in these domains necessitates comprehensive binary code analysis. However, despite the urgent need, a universal approach to analyzing JavaScript binaries is lacking due to the bytecode heterogeneity across the various JavaScript virtual machines.In this paper, to fill this gap, we present the first grammar-free, universal program analysis approach tailored for JavaScript binaries. We first design a syntax-independent intermediate representation called JasByte to encode diverse JavaScript binaries. We then develop a universal translator equipped with a set of APIs to transform JavaScript binaries into JasByte. We design a suit of program analysis algorithms for error detection, debugging, and fuzzing, to identify bugs in JavaScript VMs. We design and implement a software prototype JasFree and conduct extensive evaluations. Our results show that JasFree effectively enables construction of diverse static and dynamic analysis by reducing the overhead from 660.38% to 290.84%, outperforming the state-of-the-art tool Jalangi2. Moreover, JAS-FREE facilitates effective mutation of JasByte, resulting in the detection of 25 new vulnerabilities, all of which were missed by existing methods.}

	abstract = {Currently, formal analysis of security protocols under the symbolic model has become a crucial approach in the field of protocol analysis, owing to its intuitiveness and universality. However, researchers using various symbolic security protocol verifiers need to thoroughly understand the strengths and weaknesses of these verifiers, as well as their specific encoding models. A&B protocol description and CAS+ protocol description are highly favored by researchers due to their intuitiveness, but their limitation lies in the fact that these two descriptions can only be used for their corresponding verifiers. In this study, we constructed a bridge connecting different symbolic security protocol verifiers. Building upon existing compilers A&B to TAMARIN and CAS+ to AVISPA, we extended A&B to CAS+ and CAS+ to A&B using the lexical analyzer Flex and the parser generator tool Bison. Thus, this bridge enables leveraging the respective strengths of each symbolic security protocol verifier in a short period. It also greatly facilitates security protocol researchers in analyzing protocols using intuitive protocol descriptions through various formal analysis tools.}

	abstract = {Link Flooding Attacks (LFA) are increasingly challenging the availability and stability of Software-Defined Networks (SDN), leveraging their distributed and covert nature to escape detection. Existing methods such as packet analysis and behavioral patterns struggle with pinpointing specific target attack paths due to the dynamic routing and distribution of attack traffic across multiple entry points, making it difficult to implement defensive measures effectively. This paper introduces a novel detection method using a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), which combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for temporal pattern recognition and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for spatial topology analysis. Unlike traditional approaches, our model leverages In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) for real-time traffic and topology monitoring, enhancing our ability to pinpoint and mitigate LFAs. We innovatively transform the detection of attacked links into a dual-point anomaly detection problem, significantly increasing the accuracy of identifying compromised links. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves high detection accuracy but also ensures the efficient use of network resources, making it particularly effective for resource-constrained environments.}

It allows users to quickly set up a DoH server by combining several components which create a layered structure. However, the multi-layer setup, which involves both HTTPS and DNS protocols, makes internal structural details more difficult to be detected. To address this issue, we propose a method that utilizes cross-protocol fingerprinting and analysis techniques, which is capable of identifying various components of multi-layer DoH servers with a focus on the underlying differences within protocol. Using this approach, we developed LayyerX, a system for detecting multi-layer DoH servers. Finally, through experiments and large-scale measurements in the wild, we showcased LayyerX’s outstanding capabilities and presented a meaningful structural overview of multi-layer DoH server.}

	abstract = {Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are essential for creating numerous domain names automatically, commonly used to make malicious domains more stealthy and persistent online. To counteract DGAs, deep learning-based detection methods have been proposed, significantly reducing the effectiveness of traditional DGAs. However, due to inherent vulnerabilities in deep learning models, these detection methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial DGAs focus on character-based detection methods but overlook word-based structures, leading to weak performance against advanced word-based detection methods like graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose an innovative adversarial method and name it Word-Character DGA (WCDGA). The main idea is to create domain names by combining high-frequency words with common prefixes and suffixes found in reputable domains. This process utilizes a bidirectional encoder (BERT) and implements character transformations based on edit distance. We evaluate WCDGA against established character-based DGA detection methods (LSTM.MI, MIT, NYU) and the latest word-based method DGGCN. The results demonstrate that WCDGA out-performs existing adversarial DGAs in its evasion capabilities, successfully bypassing multiple detection methods simultaneously.

	abstract = {Side-channel leakage acquisition plays a crucial role in side-channel analysis against cryptographic implementations, since it usually has a decisional impact on the security claims of the target devices. While most existing research has concentrated on power consumption acquisition settings, the exploration of electromagnetic (EM) radiation leakage acquisition remains limited and surprisingly under-discussed. In this study, we systematically investigate the parameter setting for EM leakage acquisition across two devices of different architectures. We specifically examine the effects of the amplifier, coupling mode, sampling rate, and EM probe on the quality of collected EM traces. For the first device STM32F405, our proposed optimal acquisition settings enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 16 compared to the reference settings and reduce the number of EM traces required to achieve a success rate of 90% by a factor of 38. For the second device ATmega2560, the optimal settings improve the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 400 compared to the reference settings and reduce the number of EM traces required to achieve a success rate of 90% by a factor of 320. In summary, this work offers a comprehensive investigation into high-quality EM leakage acquisition. While some conclusions may be specific to certain devices, we believe that the proposed guidelines can be applied to EM trace acquisition in other devices as well.}

	abstract = {Underground forums serve as hubs for cybercriminal activities, offering a space for anonymity and evasion of conventional online oversight. In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats—from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums 1  dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code 2 .}

	abstract = {While encrypted traffic improves security, it is also used by attackers to hide the transmission content to evade detection. Currently, traffic side-channel features combined with Deep Learning (DL) are widely used for malicious traffic classification, but traditional DL-based methods require large training samples and struggle with new threats. Prototypical networks in meta-learning have been effective in few-shot malicious traffic classification. However, existing methods face challenges such as "overlooking hierarchical traffic dependencies" and "bias in class prototype generation". The former means that the existing methods lack the representation design based on the hierarchical structure of traffic, resulting in insufficient feature extraction, and the latter indicates that the existing methods struggle to capture the diverse distribution of traffic features, resulting in unstable classification performance. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a few-shot encrypted malicious traffic classification method based on Hierarchical Semantics and Adaptive Prototype Learning Network (HANet). First, network traffic’s fine-grained features are represented in a multi-level matrix, with a hierarchical network structure designed to extract features comprehensively. Then, class prototypes are dynamically generated using a neighborhood partitioning method to balance simple and complex traffic feature distributions, enhancing generalization. Experiments on the CICandMal2017 dataset show that HANet offers significant performance over other few-shot malicious traffic classification methods. HANet has achieved a classification accuracy of more than 80% with only 5, 10, and 15 labeled traffic samples, realizing effective detection of few-shot encrypted malicious traffic.}

	abstract = {The MITRE ATT&CK Framework provides a rich and actionable repository of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By leveraging the associations among these techniques, we can infer unobserved techniques based on those have been observed. Current machine learning inference methods based on small-scale data face the following problems: "logical dependencies missing" and "complex associations missing." The former means that current association methods rely solely on the statistical dependencies between attack techniques while ignoring the logical dependencies involved in executing those techniques. The latter indicates that current inference methods simplify the complex associations between technologies based on statistical assumptions, failing to adequately capture the long-range and intricate real-world relationships between techniques. To address these problems, we propose an Attack Inference model based on heterogeneous DEpendency graphs (AIDE). First, we extract three types of logical dependencies: CVE, Pattern, and Conditional, which allows us to construct a heterogeneous dependency graph among the techniques, thus addressing the "logical dependencies missing" problem. Second, we employ Relation Graph Convolution Neural Networks (RGCN) to aggregate heterogeneous dependencies into representation vectors of the techniques. Finally, we utilize the sequence inference model Decoder, which excels at capturing implicit contextual associations, to infer unknown attacks, thus addressing the "complex associations missing" problem. Experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in both hits@k and map@k metrics.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has introduced significant challenges in network security, particularly the emergence of DoH tunnels. Existing methods, reliant on large labeled datasets, struggle to adapt to novel DoH tunnel variants. We present ProtoDoH, a novel framework for DoH tunnel detection that uniquely integrates prototypical networks with meta-learning. Our method leverages few-shot learning principles to detect DoH tunnels with minimal training samples, addressing the challenge of sample scarcity in new attack scenarios. By employing a metric-based meta-learning framework, ProtoDoH enables rapid adaptation to novel DoH tunnel variants, significantly reducing the detection time for new DoH tunnels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves over 99% accuracy in detecting DoH tunnels with as few as 5 samples, notably outperforming traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities across different network environments and DoH tunnel tools.}

SBOM generation tools take project source files and provide an SBOM as output, interacting with the software ecosystem. While SBOMs are a substantial improvement for security practitioners, providing a complete and correct SBOM is still an open problem. This paper investigates the causes of the issues affecting SBOM completeness and correctness, focusing on the PyPI ecosystem. We analyze four popular SBOM generation tools using the CycloneDX standard. Our analysis highlights issues related to dependency versions, metadata files, remote dependencies, and optional dependencies.

This includes inconsistencies in the presence of metadata files as well as variations in how their content is formatted.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the utilization of Ethereum has significantly increased, positioning it as a favored platform among criminal entities. A recently proposed blacklisting method offers a compelling approach; however, its implementation faces numerous challenges. For instance, criminals may circumvent the blacklisting mechanism by creating new addresses and there are several ambiguities in their explanation. This paper explores the increasing use of Ethereum for criminal activities, focusing on the challenges of enforcing blacklisting to curb illegal transactions. We analyse blacklisting within cryptocurrency networks, particularly Ethereum, and develop features to detect illegal patterns. The study identifies unique issues in transaction networks that require specialised solutions beyond general cryptocurrency techniques. We propose a detection model based on these features and validate its effectiveness using real Ethereum datasets. The paper also reviews regulatory guidelines, highlighting ambiguities in their interpretation. Experiments on real-world data underscore the need to integrate technical methods and consider Shapley-value-based frameworks in designing effective solutions. The novelty of the method lies in its development of a feature-based detection model, leveraging Shapley-value frameworks to enhance explanation, address Ethereum’s unique challenges, and empirically validate its effectiveness using real Ethereum data, offering a more robust solution than traditional blacklisting approaches.}

	abstract = {Quantum computing has revolutionized the approach to solving complex problems and handling vast datasets. However, data leakage in quantum computing may present privacy risks. While differential privacy (DP) has been a classical solution to protect privacy by injecting artificial noises, the implementation of DP within the quantum domain remains an under-explored area. We observe that there is a potential to leverage the inherent noises generated by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices during quantum operations for achieving DP in quantum computing. Given that these inherent noises are uncontrollable, we take the lead to utilize quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques to manage quantum differential privacy (QDP) protection levels. In our approach, we offer a tangible description of the "closeness" between neighboring quantum datasets and introduce a novel QDP definition based on observables of interest. Our simulations reveal that factors like the distance between neighboring quantum states and the number of circuit executions influence the privacy budget. Notably, by controlling the QEM samples while keeping the number of circuit executions fixed, QEM allows for substantial noise control to meet a desired privacy budget. Furthermore, we extend analysis from single-qubit to multiple qubits and discuss the impact of observables of interest on the privacy budget.}

	abstract = {Individuals and companies increasingly adopt encrypted deduplication systems for their enhanced security and efficiency benefits. Server-aided encrypted deduplication systems are the state-of-the-art scheme to resist brute-force attacks. However, it is overly reliant on a single centralized key server and vulnerable to a single point of failure. To this end, existing schemes have implemented distributed key servers based on secret sharing of the master key to resist a single point of failure. Nevertheless, this design has some inherent limitations in balancing security and scalability. Secret sharing of the master key effectively mitigates single points of failure, while negatively impacting system scalability. To address the above limitations, we propose a scalable client-side encrypted deduplication with distributed key servers based on secret sharing of the data key. To resist brute-force attacks, we also design a double-layer matching mechanism to achieve secure and effective duplicate check and key delivery. Additionally, drawing inspiration from random oracle models, we put forward a pseudo-random response strategy for key servers to safeguard key privacy effectively. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme achieves both security and scalability, which is well-suited for deployment in large-scale systems and offers robust protection against a single point of failure.}

Taking into account personalized privacy concerns of users, in this work we design an machine learning-based optimal data transaction mechanism that incentivizes users to share their data based on their truthful privacy valuation. We treat data with varying privacy protection levels (PPLs) as distinct sale items. By offering multiple privacy options for users to choose from, the mechanism improves data utility and encourages users to select options that reflect their true privacy valuations. By integrating machine learning into the option design in mechanism, our approach achieves optimal data utility without prior knowledge of the privacy valuation distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that even with an unknown distribution of user privacy valuations, the proposed mechanism enables users to select the optimal PPL according to their preferences, while data buyers can maximize the utility of procured data.}

	abstract = {Keystroke dynamics are behavioral biometric traits that are frequently proposed to be used in novel authentication systems. Keystroke dynamics are based on the analysis of intervals between keystroke events originating from user input and thus directly depend on available timing information. However, modern web browsers limit the accuracy of timestamps to improve security and privacy. This study systematically investigates the impact of limited timestamp accuracies on the performance of keystroke dynamic analysis. By conducting multiple experiments with popular web browsers, we demonstrate that the minor timestamp modifications that mitigate timing side-channel attacks do not interfere with the effectiveness of keystroke dynamics analysis algorithms. Furthermore, they are surprisingly resilient to larger timestamp modifications, which results in a serious threat to users’ privacy. This research provides fundamental knowledge enabling researchers, privacy engineers, and browser vendors to study risks in keystroke dynamics-related systems and to develop mitigations against tracking methods that fingerprint users instead of devices or browsers.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely recognized for its potential to enhance efficiency and productivity across various industries. However, its increasing prevalence has also made it a more attractive target for cybercriminals. While many advanced cryptographic solutions have been developed to secure IoT, some practical security and privacy issues such as self-sovereign delegation, flexible revocation, and lightweight access remain inadequately addressed in existing solutions. In this paper, we propose PLIC, a Privacy-aware Lightweight IoT Communication scheme, which not only enables any authorized user to flexibly delegate their lightweight access privileges to other delegatees, such that they can also access the authorized IoT targets in the same lightweight way, but also supports flexible revocation of access for specific users without affecting non-revoked users. Specifically, our solution leverages wildcard-based access control and tree-based encryption technologies to enable self-sovereign delegation, dynamic membership updates, and stably efficient decryption overhead in IoT. In addition, comprehensive security proofs are rendered to validate the robustness of our approach. Finally, experimental comparisons with similar methodologies demonstrate the practicality and superior performance of our solution, which indicates its effectiveness for practical IoT appli-cations.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the right to deletion has been recognized by numerous privacy regulations, requiring data controllers not only to delete data upon request but also to inform other relevant controllers to remove any redundant copy of the same data. Designing an efficient framework to distribute and confirm deletion notifications across all involved controllers presents significant challenges. These challenges include: 1) ensuring that all controllers holding the target data to be deleted receive notifications, 2) securing the distribution of deletion notifications within untrusted networks to guard against malicious threats, and 3) minimizing compliance costs while accommodating a high volume of deletion requests. In this paper, we present TrustNotify, a comprehensive framework addressing these challenges. TrustNotify leverages a cross-plane architecture consisting of regulatory and service planes. The regulatory plane ensures the completeness of the deletion notification process through a Cuckoo filter-based data circulation recording algorithm, while the service plane implements a secure and efficient protocol for distributing deletion notifications. This protocol integrates HMAC-based hop-by-hop verification, recursive acknowledgment, and probabilistic sampling, achieving both security and scalability. We developed a prototype of TrustNotify and the experimental results demonstrate its practicality and strong performance.}

	abstract = {In cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), where data is distributed across multiple organizations such as hospitals, incentivizing collaboration while preserving data privacy presents a significant challenge. FL markets facilitate transactions among these organizations, introducing a budget-feasible two-sided allocation problem. Budget constraints are a realistic and crucial issue that reflects the economic capacities and engagement levels of market participants, but they also increase the complexity of allocation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes BudoMech, a novel budget-feasible double auction mechanism. BudoMech integrates requesters’ values and providers’ costs to determine allocations and payments, ensuring adherence to budget constraints while guaranteeing truthfulness. The mechanism sorts values and costs, uses virtual prices to iteratively calculate allocation quantities and prices, and then outputs the final allocations and payments. Theoretical analysis confirms that BudoMech satisfies desirable properties, including budget feasibility, individual rationality, truthfulness, and efficiency. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that BudoMech is an effective solution for resource allocation in FL markets.}

	abstract = {Concerns about how third parties manage personal information have led to the development of decentralized identities (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs). The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group has been developing standards for DIDs and VCs. In the W3C standards, a DID identifies an entity (a DID holder) and a VC confirms that this DID holder has some associated attributes. A DID holder can obtain many VCs and confirm any number of these VCs to others (verifiers) in verifiable presentations (VPs). In order to keep a holder’s identity and attributes private, it is necessary to achieve anonymous VPs that allows this information to be kept confidential. The W3C working group recommends using randomizable signatures to create VCs with zero-knowledge proofs for this purpose. However, the anonymous VPs provided by the this method are limited that in the real world, credentials in cross domains cannot be universally verified. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new scheme, called Verifiable Credentials with anonymous DIDs (VCaDID), which aims to achieve anonymous VPs in cross-domain settings. The main technique in our VCaDID scheme is a ring signature with multiple attributes by hiding a holder’s public key among a ring of holders. In our scheme, we set private keys associated with the holder’s DID and attributes, which allow the holder to anonymously present these credentials in a verifiable way. We also prove that the proposed VCaDID scheme satisfies correctness, anonymity and unforgeability under security assumptions of discrete log and random oracle model. Finally, we implement our scheme to demonstrate its feasibility.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, in Android ecosystem, to bypass current malware detections, adversaries often distribute the malicious and sensitive functions into different apps. These apps collude to conduct some malicious activities, such as illegally collecting the user’s sensitive data. To further understand the harm of app collusion, we conduct a real-world study. Besides the simple collusion case with two apps, which has been well studied, there are also some complicated collusion cases that have seldom been studied but would greatly endanger users’ privacy. These cases can be categorized into N-to-1 collusion, 1-to-N collusion, and chain-based collusion. To deal with such complicated collusion attacks and detect the hidden partners, a detection framework CSCdroid was proposed. CSCdroid obtains sensitive data flow and static features such as ICC (Inter-Component Communication) channels in apps through static analysis. Then it detects potential collusion apps by data flow linking. To show the effectiveness of CSCdroid, we apply it to the app dataset provided by DroidBench, and its F1 score can reach 0.91, which is better than the current existing work Amandroid and DIALDroid. We conduct experiments on a real-world app dataset (4,100 apps) with CSCdroid, and results show that 73 apps leak the user’s sensitive data. Some of the 73 apps present complex collusion scenarios with other apps. These complex collusion scenarios can result in the aggregation of sensitive information within an app, posing a significant threat to user privacy.}

	abstract = {A practical Multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) scheme with privacy-preserving properties realized by Inner Product Predicate Encryption (IPPE) was introduced by Michalevksy and Joye at ESORICS 2018. It requires secret keys linked to an attribute vector v and ciphertext associated with policy vector x to satisfy a certain predicate P(x, v) for decryption. Notably, the attribute information remains undisclosed during ciphertext inspection, provided no additional information about x and v is available. Despite extensive discussions in the literature concerning its efficiency, decentralization, and access policy structure, the security of certain schemes under the fully adaptive security model—first defined by Datta, Komargodski, and Waters at Eurocrypt 2023, which reflects real-world situations—has not been sufficiently explored. Specifically, their scheme is vulnerable to rogue-key attacks: an adversary can compromise a single attribute authority and then adaptively delay the publication of the compromised authority’s public key, crafting it based on the public keys of all other authorities. This ability to introduce a rogue key by compromising a single authority poses a significant security risk, as the adversary could decrypt any ciphertext without satisfying the policy. Addressing this gap, we propose an enhanced MA-ABE scheme building on Michalevsky and Joye (ESORICS’18), offering proof of resistance against rogue-key attacks. Additionally, we have conducted simulations of both the original and the enhanced schemes to evaluate the defense mechanisms’ resource requirements under consistent parameters and analyzed the cost implications of rogue-key attacks as the number of attribute authorities increases in the scheme.}

	abstract = {Private Spatial Range Queries (PSRQ) over outsourced data services have been widely applied in various practical scenarios in recent years. However, prior schemes that support dynamic updates cannot ensure both forward and backward privacy. Verifiable schemes incur high verification overheads. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and dynamic PSRQ scheme (VDPSRQ) to address these two issues. First, we define PSRQs over the outsourced database and define the forward and backward privacy for VDPSRQ. Then, we index outsourced databases using a G-tree and propose a two-kind Intersection Predicate Encryption (IPE) to implement efficient and forward-backward private PSRQs. Moreover, we design a lightweight completeness mechanism for results based on the RSA accumulator and G-tree. Through rigorous security analysis, we prove that our scheme can not only protect forward and backward privacy, but also guarantee security under chosen-plaintext attacks. Comprehensive experiments over a real-world database demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our scheme. Compared with baselines in terms of search and verification, our scheme is 200× faster, with only 76.2% verification time cost.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning approach, makes it possible to realize global training and knowledge sharing of models while protecting data privacy. However, existing FL methods still face some challenges. First, since the local client model has only a limited parameter capacity when the model learns a new task or new data, previously learned information can be lost quickly and in large amounts, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Second, the private information may still be leaked by analyzing the parameters uploaded by the clients. Besides, the data distributions of FL clients are usually non-independent and identically distributed, leading to a degradation of the quality of the global aggregation model. These challenges pose obstacles to the effective implementation of federated learning. To address the above issues, we propose a novel differentially private federated class-incremental learning (DPFCIL) method. Specifically, it includes three aspects: 1) We design an elastic memory strategy that mitigates the class incremental model’s forgetting of old knowledge by dynamically expanding new modules and applying network regularization at the local client. 2) Before uploading parameters to the local client, we introduce differential privacy to prevent information leakage effectively. 3) We propose to use a dynamic adaptive aggregation method that relies on model parameter differences in the server aggregation phase to mitigate the loss of global accuracy due to the heterogeneity of the client’s data. Extensive experiments are designed to compare with state-of-the-art baseline methods on several datasets, and the experimental results show that DPFCIL outperforms other methods by an average of at least 5.6% in accuracy.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has effectively solved the dilemma of "data silos" and has been widely applied into various fields. However, in real-life, user data is often Not Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID), and eavesdroppers can still infer users’ private data from various parameters transmitted in FL. Nevertheless, few privacy-preserving FL schemes focus on data heterogeneity, and offline problem causes more accuracy loss under Non-IID. This paper introduces a multi-key homomorphic encryption algorithm to construct two privacy-preserving FL schemes based on FedProx and SCAFFOLD, namely EMKProx and EMKSCAF. The two schemes both incorporate an anti-offline mechanism and take diverse measures to mitigate Non-IID’s impact on convergence speed, where EMKProx inserts a proximal term into loss function which is more suitable for poor hardware condition and EMKSCAF adds control variate to meet higher model performance requirement. We give security analyses to prove their security. In addition, we conduct simulations and comparisons with FL schemes using other privacy protection mechanisms, which show that our schemes behave more efficient and gain higher accuracy than the others.}

	abstract = {Tor has provided hidden services (HS) and protected the anonymity of the Web server with hidden service directory servers. Some criminals use hidden services to engage in illegal activities, such as anonymous transactions, pirated distribution, hacking, etc. In order to protect the security of cyberspace, hidden service traffic needs to be deanonymized. Artificial intelligence-based methods have become the most promising, but there are still two shortcomings in current research work. First, some of them mainly uses the size and direction sequence of the data packet as the input to complete the recognition, without mining the features of network traffic from many views. Second, they extract information from different view, but just concatenate them together instead of fuse them densely. Therefore, in this paper we propose a Tor hidden service traffic identification method with multi views named TriViewNet. TriViewNet extracts information from three different views, local flow, TLS layer, and TCP layer for identification ad fuses them with Tri-attention module. By comparing with state-of-the-art models, the results show that our TriViewNet outperforms in the recognition of Tor HS traffic.}

	abstract = {As a new paradigm among various D2D communication applications and use cases, D2D relay communication is a powerful underlay for 5G/6G to extend network coverage and increase communication reliability at the edge of cells. Despite its benefits, new application scenarios and system architecture expose D2D relay communications to unique security and privacy threats. Existing works proposed by neither 3GPP specifications nor academic research literature adequately address the issues of system security, privacy, and efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose SP 2 -RD2D, a lightweight secure and privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement protocol in D2D relay communication. This protocol enables remote users located outside or at the edge of the cell to establish a secure connection to the service network through relays. Meanwhile, SP 2 -RD2D provides identity privacy preservation for remote users and relays. We analyze the security of SP 2 -RD2D and assess its performance from both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations. The result indicates that the proposed protocol effectively meets security and privacy requirements, demonstrating high efficiency in both computational and communication aspects.}

	abstract = {Privacy policies are crucial for informing users about how their personal information is collected, stored, and used by organizations. However, privacy policies are lengthy, information-dense, and filled with legalese, making them difficult for users to comprehend. Although previous studies have attempted to improve the readability of privacy policies via traditional machine learning techniques, these methods overlook or oversimplify critical information or rely on predefined question-answers that cannot adapt to user personalized queries. Inspired by the fact that large language models perform well in terms of text comprehension and text question-answering, we propose a novel large language model-based privacy policy question-answering framework, which aims to help users understand privacy policies more intuitively and effectively. Specifically, our framework consists of two modules: the personal data practice disclosure module, which performs a pre-training and fine-tuning approach to extract structured information about data categories and corresponding data operations from privacy policies. The retrieval-augmented question-answering module integrates sparse and dense retrievers to find the most relevant evidence from the privacy policy and generate responses corresponding to user queries. The experimental results across two representative datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other prior methods.}

	abstract = {Image processing and analysis capabilities have been revolutionized by the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies. Model inference enables powerful image analytics, however, complex neural networks often require more computing and storage resources than end device can provide. While cloud-based model inference helps alleviate the resource constraints of these devices. However, transferring sensitive image data to the cloud server raises significant privacy concerns. Existing approaches usually either encrypt the images locally and send them to the cloud server or deploy the model locally, which fails to exploit the computing capability of the end device or reveals a machine-learning model. To this end, in this paper, we proposed MIND, a privacy-preserving model inference framework via end-cloud collaboration. MIND makes the end device and the cloud server jointly perform layer-by-layer computations required by model inference through cryptographic primitives including the homomorphic cryptosystem and additive secret sharing. For linear layers, MIND always chooses the less expensive option between data encryption and model parameter encryption. Results of experimental evaluations on several models show MIND is effective and outperforms the existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Graph representation is an invaluable tool in digital forensics, offering the flexibility to depict diverse objects and relationships. This capability empowers investigators to model and analyze a broad spectrum of scenarios. This paper focuses on Digital Forensic Knowledge Graphs (DFKGs), an extension of the STIX standard language designed for digital forensic cases. DFKGs tailor STIX objects (nodes) and relationships (edges) to enhance their relevance in the digital forensic context. However, building the DFKGs of real-world cases is error-prone. Common issues include inconsistencies where edges fail to align with attributes in associated nodes. This paper introduces a machine learning-based approach to address the problem of relationship inconsistency in real-world DFKGs. The proposed method utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model trained on a case repository to evaluate relationship consistency in new cases. We evaluated the model with the DFKGs of 10 real-world cases, containing diverse inconsistent relationships. The accuracy scores range from 68% to 84% and the F1 scores from 78% to 89%. The results indicate that the approach can be promising to improve the quality of DFKGs.}

However, this growth has also exposed vulnerabilities, particularly front-running attacks, where malicious actors exploit transaction ordering to gain illegal profits. We present TransFront, a novel approach for detecting transaction-based front-running attacks in DeFi. By leveraging a bi-path feature fusion strategy, TransFront adeptly captures both macro and micro transaction patterns, improving the accuracy and reliability of detection. This method addresses the limitations of existing detection techniques and provides a comprehensive solution by integrating feature extraction, feature fusion, and classification into an end-to-end model. Experimental results demonstrate that TransFront outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score performance. These findings underscore the potential of TransFront to significantly improve transaction security and asset protection in DeFi.}

	abstract = {Cyber-attacks have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, occurring frequently through various paths. Numerous attack techniques, such as ransomware, advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, and viruses facilitated by generative artificial intelligence (GAI), are threatening systems. Attackers often remain hidden for extended periods, using networks to infiltrate and spread within internal systems, aiming to steal sensitive information. These stealthy lateral movements are difficult to detect and defend against, necessitating a graph-based approach to effectively track and analyze threats. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based threat behavior tracing method that derives more meaningful results through the information retrieval functions in the large language model (LLM). We present a suitable graph model for threat tracing by comparing label property graph (LPG) and resource description framework (RDF) as graph methods for knowledge extraction in RAG.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy protection method for machine learning, enabling the maintenance of data localization and privacy during training. However, the system heterogeneity leads to different time consumption for each client to complete each round of local training, thereby causing a serious straggler effect and affecting the overall efficiency of federated learning. Existing work has addressed the system heterogeneity issue by proposing task allocation strategies based on client capabilities to solve the straggler effect. However, simply adjusting the training tasks based solely on client capabilities can cause a decrease in the accuracy of local models, affecting the global model’s accuracy. In this paper, we propose AdaptFL, an adaptive client task allocation-based synchronous federated learning algorithm. This algorithm selects clients with a high probability of participation in training in each round. It adjusts the number of local epochs for clients dynamically based on training speed and the loss of local model. AdaptFL can alleviate the straggler effect effectively without reducing model accuracy, thereby enhancing the overall training efficiency of federated learning. Finally, we evaluate AdaptFL using the CIFAR-10 and FMNIST datasets, and the results demonstrate that the convergence and efficiency of AdaptFL.}

	abstract = {As the coverage of permissioned blockchains expands and the number of participating replicas increases, a scalable and efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol is essential for large-scale blockchain. Unfortunately, previous BFT consensus protocols rely on a single leader to drive the protocol, which becomes a bottleneck for system scalability when the number of replicas exceeds a certain threshold. Although some proposals suggest hierarchically grouping nodes into different layers to alleviate verification pressure on the single leader. However, existing solutions only support serial execution between layers, causing performance and latency bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose TierFlow, the first layered consensus protocol that supports pipelined execution, maintaining high throughput in scenarios with a large-scale deployment of replicas. TierFlow innovatively addresses the serial execution bottleneck in layered consensus by decoupling inter-layer consensus. To eliminate redundant phases, we use a pre-proof method to advance the next round of verification, and utilize delayed verification to merge similar verification workflows. We implement TierFlow and compare it with advanced BFT protocols such as HotStuff and Fast-HotStuff. We conduct extensive experiments with over 100 replicas, demonstrating that TierFlow achieves throughput 14x higher than Fast-HotStuff in large-scale application scenarios, with the performance disparity widening as scale increases.}

	abstract = {In the contemporary digital landscape, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the availability and integrity of online services. As cloud services and network infrastructures increasingly adopt distributed architectures, the challenge of defending against these attacks has become more complex. This paper introduces ClusterX, a novel two-tiered scheduling framework designed to enhance DDoS defense and service quality in distributed clusters. ClusterX incorporates Moving Target Defense (MTD) principles with a hierarchical, collaborative approach, featuring Program Chairs and Area Chairs that dynamically manage user-proxy mappings to counteract the fluid nature of DDoS attacks. The architecture of ClusterX is underpinned by a proactive transfer mechanism, which leverages user-service activity profiles to intelligently redistribute user traffic across clusters. This mechanism ensures that no single cluster becomes a bottleneck, maintaining low latency and high service quality even under high traffic conditions. Program Chairs oversee the global traffic distribution, while Area Chairs execute localized scheduling decisions, working in tandem to prevent traffic congestion and enhance the resilience of the network. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ClusterX in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks, while maintaining high service availability. The results highlight the superiority of our approach in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern cyber threats and the benefits of a coordinated defense strategy in distributed cloud environments. ClusterX represents a significant advancement in the field of network security, offering a robust and adaptive solution to one of the most pressing challenges in cybersecurity today.}

	abstract = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme allows for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it which makes it more popular in various domains. Most previous FHE constructions are limited by the large ciphertext expansion rate and error growth rate. Learning with errors (LWE) problem is a popular primitive for constructing lattice-based FHE. Many algebraic variants of LWE are also developed with further promising cryptographic features. Most previous known LWE variants (over the commutative base rings) are unified into a general framework by Peikert et al. at TCC 2019. In 2022, a new algebraically structured LWE problem over the d-degree cyclic algebra (CLWE) (with modulus q), a typical non-commutative ring, was proposed by Grover et al.. To further explore the utility and potential advantages of this new variant, it is interesting to design new lattice-based FHE schemes by using CLWE. In this paper, by following the diagrams of Gentry-Sahai-Waters (GSW13 for short), we propose a FHE scheme based on the CLWE with an even small ciphertext size. Due to our further expansion of the plaintext space, the average ciphertext expansion rate (CER for short) is smaller. More precisely, compared to original GSW13 and the related GSW-style constructions, the ciphertext size of our proposal is reduced by almost at least 23.69%, and the average CER is reduced about 96% due to our expansion of the plaintext space. Besides, our FHE has an even small error growth rate (EGR for short). After one time multiplication of two ciphertexts, the asymptotical EGR is reduced about 49.8% compared to the original GSW13 and the related GSW-style constructions. Typically, the smaller ciphertext size, CER and EGR make our FHE scheme more efficient in trusted computing environment.}

	abstract = {Smart contracts are widely employed in the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance automation, transparency, and security in operations. However, vulnerabilities within smart contracts can compromise the security of IoT systems. Fuzzing is commonly used to efficiently detect these vulnerabilities, utilizing effective mutation strategies such as the random search mechanism called Havoc to generate diverse inputs for achieving edge coverage. Despite its effectiveness, existing fuzzers for smart contracts often utilize Havoc from the fuzzer AFL for C programs without significant adaptation or enhancement. Consequently, the full potential of Havoc remains underexplored. To address this issue, we conduct a comprehensive study involving experiments on 200 meticulously labeled smart contracts using four popular fuzzers integrated with Havoc. Specifically, our research involves optimizing the interaction between Havoc and these fuzzers. We discover that allocating more computational resources to Havoc not only enhances the edge coverage of the fuzzers but also narrows the performance gap among different fuzzers. Furthermore, our investigation into the mutator stacking mechanism of Havoc reveals that dynamically adjusting the stack size and mutator type according to the fitness of seeds can further improve fuzzer performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose Havoc-Ts, which approaches the Havoc mutation strategy as a dynamic recommender system problem to adjust stack size and mutator type adaptively. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in both the edge coverage performance and the vulnerability detection accuracy using our method.}

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of low-quality electronic medical record(EMRs), the medical knowledge graph is used to enhance the quality and trustworthiness of EMRs. We propose a novel EMR quality control method that integrates a knowledge graph with deep learning techniques and complement it with a system implementation. The entities and relationships are extracted by the End to End Medical Information Extraction based on Knowledge Base (MIE-KB), which leverages an encoder-decoder framework and self-supervised pre-training model based on BERT. We introduce a bidirectional QC system for assessing the content normality and diagnostic rationality of medical records to classify and detect contradictions. By using more than 500,000 desensitized medical records covering 129 diseases in 7 categories, deep learning methods are used to learn the relationship between the desensitized medical records and the diagnosis features, and to determine whether the diagnosis is reasonable through the inference of medical knowledge mapping. We use the UMLS and other standards to evaluate the extraction accuracy and the diagnostic accuracy of the QC system. The system evaluation results show that the system can effectively boost the quality control effect of EMRs. The end-to-end pre-training model and bidirectional QC system improve the quality of EMRs in primary hospitals.}

	abstract = {Despite existing parallel chain systems improving blockchain throughput by allowing concurrent blocks to be appended, challenges such as the excessive number of waiting blocks before confirmation and the inconsistency between block generation order and global confirmation sequence still persist. To address these challenges, we propose CVchain, a parallel chain system with a cross-voting mechanism. Blocks from other subchains are incorporated into the consistency determination of the main chain, reducing the probability of confirmation errors. Our global sorting mechanism leverages both real-time height information and the implicit temporal order contained in voting to improve the accuracy of block ordering. Furthermore, our voting mechanism randomly splits the mining power of the system, preventing targeted attacks on the specific subchain and defending against liveness attacks. We prove the safety and liveness properties of CVchain. We demonstrated its performance with a prototype implementation and large-scale experiments involving 200 nodes across 10 cloud servers in a distributed network environment. The results indicate that CVchain achieves a latency reduction of approximately 32.3% at a confirmation error probability of 0.01 while maintaining throughput levels comparable to OHIE. Additionally, it provides enhanced transaction ordering services.}

	abstract = {The rapid rise in blockchain technology’s popularity has prompted numerous models to analyze patterns and detect anomalies in blockchain networks based on transaction history. However, most existing studies overlook transactions’ dynamic, nonlinear, and time-variant nature in a time series context. This paper introduces an innovative methodology for enhancing blockchain network performance through advanced time series analysis, anomaly detection, and correction. We propose a hybrid deep learning model integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Multi-Head Attention (MHA), and Fully Connected Network (FCN) layers to predict transaction volumes in blockchain networks. The LSTM network captures both short-term and long-term dependencies in blockchain time series data, while the MHA mechanism focuses on relevant input sequence segments. FCN layers perform final feature processing and map the output to predicted transaction volumes. To address overfitting, a Dropout layer is added between the FCN layers. Anomalies are identified using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and corrected via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Applied to real-world blockchain transaction datasets, our methodology demonstrates superior efficacy in detecting and correcting anomalies, yielding a more accurate representation of the network’s true behavior. This leads to improved estimates of average and peak throughput and network volatility.}

However, the substantial storage costs incurred by nodes have been overlooked, potentially diminishing their enthusiasm and affecting the platform’s security and sustainability. This paper proposes a sustainable storage compensation method to balance the storage profits between storage compensation providers and recipients. First, to mitigate the impact of malicious nodes, we propose a transaction storage pricing strategy based on reputation. Second, we develop a storage compensation pricing model based on Rubinstein’s game theory. We then conduct a Nash equilibrium analysis to determine the equilibrium storage compensation price for the computing power trading system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reputation-based unit price setting strategy through simulations and validate the feasibility of the game model. Compared with the two representative methods, our approach yields a higher time-average payoff and is more sustainable.}

	abstract = {The technology for AI-based encrypted traffic classification (ETC) is advancing rapidly. However, many current studies are conducted in closed network environments where traffic is classified into pre-determined classes. In the actual network environment, new traffic is constantly emerging, making anomaly detection of unknown traffic a pressing issue. The current research attempts different approaches for unknown traffic identification (UTI) from the perspective of model construction, including UTI based on n-classification, UTI based on multiple 2-classifiction, and UTI baed on (n+1)-classification. The above three approaches mentioned are prone to misclassification and have low accuracy due to issues with threshold setting, poor generalization of binary classifiers, and low credibility of generated samples. Researchers have used contrastive learning (CL) for UTI because of its strengths in feature representation. However, there are two shortcomings in the current studies. First, the feature representation of a single view cannot fully capture different classes of traffic features. Second, the existing CL schemes distinguish whether they belong to the same category by constructing pairs of positive and negative samples, but they are still unable to distinguish between known classes and unknown classes in the feature space, resulting in low accuracy. To address the above shortcomings, we propose UTI-MCL, an unknown traffic identification method using multi-view contrastive learning. Firstly, in terms of feature expression, we extract the packet length sequence and the packet byte sequence respectively to learn a more comprehensive feature representation. Secondly, in terms of model construction, we introduce an anchor and compare the distance with both positive and negative samples to help the model better separate different classes in the feature space, enhancing feature distinction. Furthermore, the distance between samples is optimized through the adaptive weights triplet loss function to balance samples from different classes. A series of experiments have proved the effectiveness of UTI-MCL. Even with unknown traffic accounting for 60%, the Fβ -Score can still exceed 94%.}

	abstract = {Masking is widely considered as an effective countermeasure against side-channel analysis (SCA) due to its provable security and efficiency. However, recent works have demonstrated that the deep learning-based SCA (DL-SCA) can effectively break the cryptographic implementations protected by the first-order Boolean maskings. Still, it is open whether higher-order masking can resist DL-SCA. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning methods can also effectively exploit the inherent leakage of higher-order Boolean masking to compromise its security. Furthermore, we employed neural weight visualization techniques to demonstrate the neural network’s capability to extract high-level features. We assess the efficiency of this novel profiling attack in both simulated and real-world scenarios. In particular, our results show that DL-SCA can effectively break the higher-order Boolean masking schemes up to the sixth and the third order in simulated and real-world cases, respectively. Furthermore, we find that using plaintext-related leakage can significantly improve the effectiveness of side-channel attacks.}

	abstract = {High-quality random numbers are essential to communication security, as one of the most important components of cryptographic modules in secure communication protocols. Compared with statistical tests, entropy estimation is considered to be a more essential method for evaluating the quality of random numbers. Prediction-based min-entropy estimators have been proposed and developed as an important branch of randomness testing tools, represented by the predictors included in NIST SP 800-90B (90B) and the estimators based on neural network (NN) in literature. The 90B methods are efficient but suffer inaccuracy in handling complex entropy sources. By contrast, NN-based methods have relatively high prediction accuracy, but the execution cost is too heavy to be implemented as an online test. This paper proposes a decision tree (DT) based entropy estimator, as well as two enhancement techniques: tailored pruning and correlation determination, to tackle the problems in existing approaches. We conduct experiments on various types of entropy sources for evaluation and comparison. The results show that the proposed DT-based estimator achieves prediction accuracy comparable to the state of the art NN-based estimator while reducing the execution time by 99.3%, making it as efficient as 90B predictors. In terms of estimation accuracy, DT-based estimator shows more powerful predictive capability than 90B predictors for complex entropy sources. Particularly, for second-order Markov entropy sources, the prediction accuracy outperforms 90B by 34.6% and TPA-LSTM by 48.7%. We believe that our proposed DT-based estimator can be an important supplement to existing standard entropy estimation methods.}

	abstract = {This study presents a new biometric authentication system leveraging ear canal acoustic features for secure identity authentication. The proposed system can capture ear acoustics using an earphone integrated with a microphone, with musical signals as the probing signal. By taking the Ear Canal Transfer Function (ECTF) as the primary feature, we develop and implement a prototype that integrates data collection and deep feature extraction using particularly modified earphones. We then employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to address the challenge of feature space overlap due to the diverse frequency components in musical signals. Our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and the robustness of our method by using ear canal acoustics for user authentication, highlighting its potential for widespread application in security-sensitive environments.}

However, these countermeasures often come with significant overhead. In this paper, we explore a solution to reduce the randomness requirement while maintaining security claims. We demonstrate the approach with Mask & Macs (M&M), a scheme that combines Boolean masking and MAC tag redundancy to provide SCA and DFA protection, addressing the challenge of high randomness requirement. We introduce a novel multiplicative masking scheme as a replacement for threshold implementation (TI) modules partially, leading to a reduction of over 50% in randomness requirement with minor increased FPGA resource overhead and latency. While the trade-off is beneficial, other limitations remain, and further research is needed to address these problems. This work provides a new perspective on improving combined countermeasures by exploring ways to reduce system overhead.}

Multi-channel fusion attacks (MCFAs) have proven to be efficient in exploiting side-channel leakages. However, a crucial step before performing MCFA is to assess whether the leakages from different channels can be effectively fused. To address this, we propose a black-box approach based on the χ 2  test of independence to assess multi-channel leakage suitability for fusion. By treating the leakages as categorical variables, our method evaluates their association without requiring knowledge of the cryptographic key or device implementation.}

	abstract = {The cross-shard account migration mechanism is one of the most advanced solutions to the unbalanced load problem in blockchain sharding systems. Existing solutions employ locking schemes to ensure the atomicity of transactions and the consistency of account states. However, these methods suffer from high transaction locking rates, degraded system performance, and disordered transaction execution sequences. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the first cross-shard account migration mechanism based on Multi-Version State Synchronization (MVSS), which ensures sequential execution of transactions while reducing the locking rate and latency, thereby enhancing system throughput. Specifically, MVSS divides related transactions into two categories based on their arrival time, and innovates to have the source shard and the destination shard process each category of transactions, instead of blocking all transactions at the source shard as in the existing schemes. Furthermore, in the special timestamp interleaving scenario, MVSS synchronizes the multiple version states of the account among the related shards according to the fine-grained order, which effectively maintains the consistency of the transaction sequence and the account state. Additionally, this paper delves into the security aspects of MVSS, proposing effective solutions to combat double-spending and replay attacks. Finally, We conducted extensive experiments based on a blockchain sharding simulator using over 2000 lines of Go to evaluate the performance of MVSS. The experimental results indicate that, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions such as Fine-tuned scheme, MVSS reduces locking time by 23.4%, decreases transaction latency by 7.5%, and improves throughput by 2.3%.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been found to be susceptible to adversarial examples, prompting the investigation of strategies aimed at enhancing their robustness against such attacks. Despite the proposition of preprocessing methods designed to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations, their adaptability to continuously evolving attack strategies remains a significant challenge. In response to this, we introduce a novel methodology, termed Self-Supervised Confidence-based Perturbation Denoising (SCPD). This approach capitalizes on self-supervised adversarial training to remove adversarial perturbations and restore natural examples. SCPD exploits the association between natural and adversarial examples, utilizing confidence as a guidance in the generation of adversarial features that are effectively generalizable. Specifically, adversarial examples are constructed by maximizing the distortion of confidence, without ground-truth labels. Subsequently, a denoising network is trained with the aim of projecting adversarial examples closer to their natural counterparts. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we provide evidence that SCPD surpasses existing adversarial training and preprocessing methodologies in terms of robustness against both unseen and adaptive attacks.}

	abstract = {The multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) task aims to acquire accurate entity representations by learning different modal information about entities, which can be used to predict missing entities or relations in knowledge graphs (KGs). The lack of multimodal information accumulation and the noise in the various modal information collected leads to different modal information contributing differently to knowledge graph completion (KGC). Therefore, it becomes crucial to effectively fusion and fully utilize the multimodal information. To solve the above problems, we propose a knowledge graph completion method based on gated adaptive fusion and conditional generative adversarial networks (GAF-CGAN). GAF-CGAN is based on a gating mechanism for deeply extracting critical information in different modal features. After this, the model fuses the features by adapting the weights between different modal features. Ultimately, we utilize the relations in the triples as conditions to guide the generator in generating fake samples with specific meanings for adversarial training, enhancing the model’s robustness. We conduct link prediction experiments on two publicly available datasets, DB15K and FB15K-237, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms existing benchmark methods and effectively improves the model’s capacity for KGC.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detectors based on deep learning have high detection accuracy and the ability to adapt to evolving cyber threats. However, a serious drawback is their vulnerability to adversarial example attacks aimed at evading detectors and natural corruptions caused by random noise in the network environment. To provide robustness guarantees for deep neural networks against various perturbations, certified defenses against any possible perturbed inputs in the lp-bounded region are gaining attention. mHowever, unlike existing approaches that focus on homogeneous image feature spaces, the progress on certified defense for the network traffic domain, which is characterized by heterogeneous features, has been very limited. To address such a gap, we propose a novel framework, Multi-order Adaptive Randomized Smoothing (MARS), for certifying the robustness of network intrusion detectors. Experiments on various deep learning-based network intrusion detector architectures show that MARS significantly improves the certification tightness (12.23% average increase in the l2 certified radius), evasion attack detection accuracy (7.17% improvement on l∞-PGD, 10.11% improvement on l1-EAD), and natural corruption detection accuracy (16.65% enhancement on latency, 18.23% enhancement on packet loss) compared to BARS, the leading and only certified defense for network intrusion detectors.}

Recent Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)-based methods are hindered by heavy overhead. Few recent studies explored GPUs to improve MPC-protected deep learning, yet integrating GPUs into MPC-protected DT with massive data-dependent operations remains challenging, raising question: can MPC-protected DT training and inference fully leverage GPUs for optimal performance?We present GTree, the first scheme that exploits GPU to accelerate MPC-protected secure DT training and inference. GTree is built across 3 parties who jointly perform DT training and inference with GPUs. GTree is secure against semi-honest adversaries, ensuring that no sensitive information is disclosed. GTree offers enhanced security than prior solutions, which only reveal tree depth and data size while prior solutions also leak tree structure. With our oblivious array access, access patterns on GPU are also protected. To harness the full potential of GPUs, we design a novel tree encoding method and craft our MPC protocols into GPU-friendly versions. GTree achieves ~11× and ~21× improvements in training SPECT and Adult datasets, compared to prior most efficient CPU-based work. For inference, GTree outperforms the prior most efficient work by 126× when inferring 10 4  instances with a 7-level tree.}

	abstract = {The backdoor attack, caused by malicious samples in the training dataset, has been proven to be a significant threat to the security of deep learning models. The victim model would perform wrongly to the inputs with the trigger. When deployed models in sensitive domains such as facial recognition or autonomous vehicles, the backdoor could lead to potentially disastrous outcomes, like passing the authentication mechanisms and causing traffic accidents. Most of the previous defense works first train the model on the suspicious training dataset and then filter suspicious samples by focusing on the different features in the representation vectors of inputs. The model must be retrained on the filtered training dataset to clear the potential backdoor, bringing in inconvenience and extra computation overhead. This work proposes a training-time sample filtering defense scheme named RTS, with which the model would only be trained once and the potential backdoor could be defended. A pivotal observation is that the target label samples contain richer backdoor-related information compared to other samples, which would result in more adjustments in the model’s weights. Therefore, we filter the poison data with an adaption strategy based on the model’s weight residual tendency in the training process. After all training iterations, we can filter all suspicious samples and obtain a benign model.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the RTS, we conduct experiments on 4 image classification datasets with different model structures at 3 different poison rates (0.01, 0.05, 0.1). Taking the poison rate of 0.05 as an example, the attack success rates on them are decreased to 6.53% (MNIST), 11.88% (CIFAR10), 36.17% (GTSRB), and 12.14% (STL10), while the accuracies of them achieve 96.92% (MNIST), 80.27% (CIFAR10), 83.05% (GTSRB), and 74.9% (STL10). We also find that the effectiveness would not be affected by the target label and suggest the value of σ be in (0.1, 0.4]. About 1% of the training data would be enough for the shadow dataset to decrease the ASR to lower than 20% robustly. These above ablation experiments demonstrate the robustness of RTS.}

Nonetheless, methods based on input reconstruction often suffer from slow training speeds and unsatisfactory reconstruction quality, limiting their practical applicability.To address these issues, we propose a region localization-guided input reconstruction defense method, named RPG-Diff. This approach utilizes image segmentation algorithms to locate key regions, which then guide the reconstruction process of the diffusion model. By leveraging information from these key regions, the diffusion model can more effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations while maintaining consistency between the reconstructed output and the original input. This significantly reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations on model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our approach exhibits superior defensive performance against various adversarial attacks and surpasses other preprocessing-based defense methods in terms of robust accuracy and average generation time.}

	abstract = {XGBoost, a widely-used machine learning algorithm, has been applied across various fields. To develop a high-quality model, federated learning is employed, allowing participants to keep their data localized while sharing gradients for global model training. However, recent studies have shown that gradients can leak sensitive information, and even when protected, they might still be vulnerable to certain attacks. While several privacy-preserving and verifiable schemes have been proposed to address this issue, they still face limitations in terms of computational and communication costs in certain scenarios. To solve the problem, we propose a privacy-preserving and verifiable XGBoost training scheme for horizontal federated learning. First, we propose a masking with one-time padding protocol (MOTP) to securely aggregate gradients, supporting both online and offline modes for generating random masks. Both approaches reduce the communication costs and improve the training efficiency. Next, we present a linear aggregation verification protocol (LAVP) to ensure the gradient integrity, which avoids complex computations, thereby improving verification efficiency. Building on MOTP and LAVP, we propose a privacy-preserving and verifiable internal node construction algorithm to train a XGBoost model for horizontal data. Detailed security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can achieve the privacy-preserving, verifiable, lossless, and efficient XGBoost training for horizontally partitioned data.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that addresses the data silo problem while maintaining privacy protection. However, a primary challenge in FL is the significant statistical heterogeneity among clients’ local data distributions, which results in local data drift and subsequent global model performance degradation. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework termed FedSOB (Local Drift Correction and Attention Aggregation for Self-Organized Behaviors Federated Learning) in this paper. The FedSOB framework is inspired by the natural self-organized behavior of fish, achieving consistency in client behavior by introducing local drift correction and attention aggregation. Each client incorporates a momentum term during gradient descent, which encapsulates both the current gradient information and the global gradient information from preceding communication rounds, thereby modifying the gradient update process for clients. Furthermore, we have proposed an improved attention aggregation algorithm that mitigates the discrepancies caused by asynchronous model updates among clients, and have named it the Behavioral Attention Aggregation. Experimental results validate the efficacy of FedSOB, showing significant improvements in model accuracy, particularly in image classification tasks under non-IID data scenarios.}

	abstract = {The transferability of adversarial examples is pivotal in black-box attacks on deep learning models. The existing transfer-based attacks typically rely on a single data augmentation technique, which hampers the diversity of generated adversarial examples. Additionally, applying a single adversarial noise generation path may impose limitations on the perturbation strength of the generated noise, thereby compromising the transferability of these examples. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Joint Training and Dual Feature Mixiup (JFM), which comprises the dual feature mixup module and joint training module. The dual feature mixup module performs feature mixing between benign and augmented images, enabling the comprehensive extraction of benign example features and enhancing the diversity of adversarial examples. Furthermore, the joint training module designs a dual-path prediction loss function that incorporates both the loss between mixed feature examples and benign examples, as well as the loss between augmented examples and benign examples, thereby enhancing the transferability of the generated examples. Empirical evaluation of the ImageNet-compatible dataset demonstrates that our JFM method exhibits superior attack capability and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {With the development of communication networks, user demand for privacy protection has been growing, and the distributed data structure also brings corresponding challenges. As awareness of the ‘the right to be forgotten’ in privacy protection increases, federated unlearning has become an important solution. Current research mainly focuses on the unlearning of specific classes, but traditional training is typically based on the order of instances. Consequently, precise and efficient unlearning of random samples is required. To address this issue, we present a novel GA-AL scheme that can quickly and effectively achieve the unlearning of random samples. Firstly, when a unlearning request is made, the gradients of all target samples are calculated. The model is then updated in reverse, and the angle of the gradient ascent is adaptively adjusted based on the current gradient direction. Subsequently, lifelong learning is incorporated to make the model more adaptable to the remaining samples, minimizing performance loss. Finally, experiments are conducted on three different types of datasets and models, focusing on four aspects: unlearning effect, efficiency, remaining data performance, and privacy protection. Compared to the Retrain baseline, the GAAL scheme has a performance gap of less than 10% and achieve a 130 times acceleration. This performed best of all experimental methods.}

	abstract = {Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) based on adversarial attacks typically introduce excessively large adversarial perturbations to change the model predictions. However, such methods are not only likely to obscure the characteristic memory of the model regarding member data but also blur the subtle characteristic differences between member and non-member data. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic adversarial perturbation reduction MIA (DAPR-MIA), which aims to enhance the ability to identify the membership of samples by reducing the perturbation strength. Specifically, DAPR-MIA first conducts a fine-grained analysis of the gradient components of conventional adversarial examples, assessing the impact of each element on the model decision to generate a sensitivity mask. This mask identifies dimensions within adversarial examples that significantly influence model predictions, referred to as sensitive dimensions. Then, by dynamically reducing the perturbation size in these sensitive dimensions, DAPR-MIA gradually approaches the minimum perturbation required to change the prediction result of samples, maximizing the retention of membership features within the sample. Finally, the deviation of the prediction results between the original sample and the adversarial example after perturbation attenuation on the target model is measured to infer whether the sample belongs to a member data. Experimental results show that DAPR-MIA significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets and deep models, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack accuracy.}

	abstract = {Dataset-Based Defense is a common proactive defense method aimed at countering backdoor attacks by filtering and removing poisoned samples from the training dataset. Recent research has utilized diffusion models to purify contaminated samples. However, during both forward and backward denoising processes, the inherent noise and distribution characteristics of the data can also affect the purification of poisoned samples, making the process unreliable. To address this issue, this paper re-examines the purification process from the perspective of causal graphs, revealing how backdoor triggers and noise act as confounding factors, generating false associations between contaminated images and labels. To eliminate this false association, we propose a Causality-Augmented Diffusion Model-Based Defense (CADMBD) method. CADMBD applies multiple iterations of forward noise addition and backward denoising to the data input in the diffusion model. During the backward denoising process, residual calculation and causal layer adjustment are used to eliminate backdoor pathways, thereby establishing a true causal relationship between benign features and labels. Finally, the most suitable generated image is selected as the final purified image based on pixel and feature distances from each iteration. Experimental results demonstrate that CADMBD effectively addresses various complex attacks, significantly enhancing the purification effect while minimizing the impact on benign sample accuracy, outperforming baseline defense methods.}

	abstract = {Microservices architecture has gained popularity in modern software development due to its scalability and flexibility. However, understanding the complexity of interactions and dependencies between services presents significant challenges, which complicates the identification and analysis of errors within microservice applications. To gain insights into the architecture and interdependencies of microservices applications, prior studies have developed dependency graphs to illustrate the relationships among services. However, the methods used to construct these dependency graphs are not suitable for common microservices applications and suffer from insufficient data granularity. To address these shortcomings, we introduce LLM4MDG, an in-novative framework for constructing microservices dependency graphs using an LLM-driven multi-agent system. By leveraging optimized prompt engineering and principles of knowledge graphs, LLM4MDG can effectively identify and interpret service interactions across diverse microservice ecosystems, achieving high accuracy and adaptability across various scenarios. We also present a new open-source dataset comprising 47 microservices applications, annotated by domain experts, to validate our frame-work. Evaluation results demonstrate that LLM4MDG achieves an 88.3% accuracy in identifying data dependencies in the Train Ticket project, a benchmark application with over 80 service instances. This study provides a robust solution for constructing dependency graphs and facilitating better system understanding and management.}

Under a more challenging threat model with only the target architecture information available, StrucTrans can fool neural image classifiers on par with poisoning- and query-based adversarial attacks, and achieve lower computational costs than pure ensemble methods. StrucTrans consists of transferring the adversarial perturbation from an independently trained masked autoencoder sharing the same architecture to substitute for the target model, and an adversarial masking function to reduce internal dependence and generalize on data samples. Experiments show that our attack method performs effectively on various architectures, demonstrating competitive robustness against state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques.

Secret sharing, as a commonly used privacy-preserving technique, has broad application prospects due to its lightweight ciphertext computation characteristics. While secret sharing offers lightweight computation, most schemes are implemented on CPU platforms, leaving room for exploration on GPUs. This paper proposes a GPU-based acceleration scheme for privacy-preserving machine learning, utilizing the ABY3 secret sharing protocol and a 32-bit integer ring, while supporting regularization techniques. Experimental results on standard neural networks, such as VGG-16 and AlexNet, demonstrate a significant performance improvement.

	abstract = {Note:This paper contains many malicious contents generated by LLMs. Jailbreak can cause large language models (LLMs) to violate moral and ethical guidelines, generating harmful text and images. However, the existing jailbreaks are high-cost (e.g., fine-tuning LLMs) and underperform when facing some specific jailbreak tasks (e.g., generating pornographic and bloody texts), which has too many limitations for reflecting the threat of jailbreak on LLMs’ security. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a black-box jailbreak with a higher attack success rate and lower cost, called Dictionary Jailbreak with Multi-round Induction (DJMI). First, in DJMI, we create a simple custom language dictionary based on specific jailbreak tasks to be performed and send it to the LLM. Then, we use the custom language from the dictionary to construct malicious prompts, instructing the LLM to respond in the custom language as much as possible. Generally, in the first round, the LLM will provide a neutral response (such as translating the malicious prompts) or refuse to answer. To counteract this, we need to emphasize that the prompts comply with ethical guidelines and repeat the prompts using the custom language. The process can be conducted with multiple rounds to guide LLM in outputting harmful content. During the attack process, the only attack cost is the transmission cost of the prompts through the official interactive interface, without any other costs of LLM fine-tuning, algorithm design and prompt generation. Thus, DJMI is a low-cost jailbreak method. We verified DJMI on multiple mainstream LLMs across various jailbreak tasks. Experiments show that compared to existing black-box jailbreaks, DJMI achieves a higher attack success rate (> 80% on average) across specific jailbreak tasks with various risk levels. Additionally, DJMI enables the LLM to provide highly detailed execution steps for harmful behaviors within a session (such as specifying proportions of ingredients, synthetic chemical formulas, experimental conditions, and other detailed information in illicit drug production), further highlighting the severity of jailbreak attacks.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL), as a distributed training paradigm, has drawn great attention from both academia and industry. Recently, privacy and security concerns have been raised for FL. Despite many efforts to protect privacy and security, an FL framework that can systematically provide privacy and security guarantees is lacking. In this work, we present TTFL, a trustworthy FL framework in practice to defend the security and privacy issues based on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA). TTFL has two core designs. (1) It achieves a high-availability privacy protection based on flexible Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It leverages the resource-rich and conveniently accessed features of the latest TEE on Arm CCA, combined with our TEE secure interconnection design, to enable the whole FL process performed in distributed TEEs, which efficiently protects parameter confidentiality and protocol integrity. (2) It achieves effective security protection by proposing an effective poisoning-resisted secure aggregation scheme and protecting it within TEE. The new proposed secure aggregation combines the advantages of existing defenses and is placed in the flexible TEE to ensure a secure, effective, and non-bypassable aggregation procedure. We implement a prototype of TTFL and evaluate it regarding security, privacy, and system performance. Evaluation results show that TTFL can comprehensively and efficiently address the main privacy and security threats in FL. For instance, compared with previous work, it improves the model accuracy by 1.9% and reduces the attack success rate by 79.7% on the CIFAR-10 dataset with only about 19.8% training time overhead.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of deep learning, generative AI models have emerged as a prominent area of focus. However, these developments bring potential security concerns. China’s guiding document of government on generative AI security identifies 31 specific security risks across five categories, including content that violates socialist core values and discriminatory content. Detecting the sensitivity of both user input and model-generated content has therefore become a critical challenge for the security of generative AI models. This paper proposes a robust scheme for detecting sensitive information in the Chinese languages generated from the large language models. Initially, we detect and classify the security risks outlined in the document "Basic Security Requirements for Generative Artificial Intelligence Service" and develop a comprehensive dataset, named Chinese Sensitive Language Detection (CSLD). Specifically, in order to leverage the semantics of languages, we introduce the topic model to pre-analyze text data and construct topic-augmented classification vectors (TACV) that supply effective contextual information for sensitive content detection. Additionally, we propose a topic-infused attention mechanism (TIAM) to provide richer contextual information and relevant topics to guide sensitive information detection. At the same time, the proposed framework is designed to integrate with various classes of Chinese pre-trained models, enabling accurate classification of sensitive content while maintaining low latency and memory usage. Furthermore, the proposed dataset surpasses existing ones in terms of coverage, data volume, and its focus on the security challenges specific to Chinese large language models. Without bells and whistles, our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and efficiency on the CSLD dataset.}

	abstract = {Machine learning-based trajectory-user linking (TUL) task, which explores human mobility patterns and identifies known users from anonymous trajectories, is widely applied in location-based personalized recommendation systems. However, TUL models implicitly and inadvertently retain users historical trajectories in training data, which could be revealed under malicious inference and analysis. To address this issue, we propose UNIRE, a knowledge transfer-style TUL model aggregation framework to protect sensitive training data. Specifically, teacher TUL models are trained with private users trajectories and then utilized to collaboratively annotate a sensitive-trajectories-isolated dataset. Leveraging this teacher-labeled dataset, student TUL model can be trained and released as the secure aggregation of teacher models, preventing attackers from arbitrarily accessing or exposing the private trajectories. Meanwhile, differential privacy is applied for safeguarding the knowledge transfer process, ensuring that aggregation information from individual teacher models is indistinguishable. Furthermore, we introduce trajectory Equalization and Pseudo Classification as data alignment and accuracy optimization mechanisms for training and aggregating, respectively. Finally, security analysis and extensive experiments indicate that UNIRE framework achieves effective sensitive training data preservation and performance-improved TUL models aggregation, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.}

However, GAT can’t proficiently handle heterogeneous data, which negatively affects model performance. Existing solutions incur substantial computational overhead when addressing these challenges, compromising efficiency and impeding practical deployment. In this paper, we propose Zephyr to enable GAT to efficiently process heterogeneous data with high performance. In Zephyr, we introduce Dynamic Multi-matrix Design and Spatial Multi-activation Design to eliminate the effects of finiteness of matrix representation capability and difference in heterogeneous spaces. Remarkably, Zephyr shows superior capability in processing heterogeneous data while requiring minimal storage space. Through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with existing schemes, Zephyr demonstrates a substantial performance improvement, increasing accuracy by over 8% on heterogeneous datasets and enhancing fitting speed by approximately 20%. Moreover, with heterogeneous data, it maintains memory overhead below 1.05x and curtails time overhead to 70%.}

	abstract = {Deep learning-based face restoration models, increasingly prevalent in smart devices, have become targets for sophisticated backdoor attacks. Through subtle trigger injection into input face images, these attacks can lead to unexpected restoration outcomes. Unlike conventional methods focused on classification tasks, our approach introduces a unique degradation objective tailored for attacking restoration models. Moreover, we propose the Adaptive Selective Frequency Injection Backdoor Attack (AS-FIBA) framework, employing a neural network for input-specific trigger generation in the frequency domain, seamlessly blending triggers with benign images. This results in imperceptible yet effective attacks, guiding restoration predictions towards subtly degraded outputs rather than conspicuous targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the degradation objective on state-of-the-art face restoration models. Additionally, it is notable that AS-FIBA can insert effective backdoors that are more imperceptible than existing backdoor attack methods, including WaNet, ISSBA, and FIBA.}

We construct a comprehensive threat model to address various perturbations in both feature and problem spaces. We apply randomization smoothing training to malicious PDF classifiers, enhancing their robustness. We further optimize the threat model with feature constraints, narrowing the perturbation range and reducing training time. Furthermore, Shapley values prioritize important features during training, reducing randomization. We assess the smoothed PDF classifiers’ effectiveness against various attacks and their robustness certificates across different perturbation distances. Experiments based on the Contagio dataset confirm that CertRob shows strong robustness against both feature-space attacks and problem-space attacks compared to existing defensive approaches.}

	abstract = {Thermal infrared object detectors play an important role in security-related tasks, necessitating feasible adversarial attacks to evaluate their robustness. In many cases, implementing attacks in the physical space by a patch demands intricate and specialized perturbations. However, state-of-the-art adversarial attacks are often impractical, as they require fixed perturbation location and are susceptible to environmental temperature, leading to attack effects overfitting to specific poses and environments. To address this, we propose a practical adversarial attack method named Paa-Tee, with two input transformation strategies. For poses, we continuously alter the patch’s position to mitigate the impact of different poses on the patch’s location. For temperature, leveraging the principles of thermal imaging, we apply various transformations to a single input image to simulate different attack environments. Meanwhile, we utilize hot and cold pastes as low-resolution patches to implement attacks in the physical world. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in both the digital and physical worlds. In the digital world, our attacks reduce the average precision of mainstream detectors by 65.44%. In the physical world, we achieve an average attack success rate of 63.77% under various distances, poses, angles, and environmental conditions.}

However, the integration of built-in key escrow and susceptibility to key exfiltration poses a prevalent challenge during the implementation of ABE. In this paper, we present a novel ABE scheme called T-ABE to address the above challenges. Specifically, T-ABE utilizes a Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. Intel SGX) to provide a precise security guarantee for the entire process, from establishing trust between users and ABE services to key generation and management, ensuring that the entire scheme can provide users with secure and reliable ABE key hosting services even when deployed in untrustworthy cloud service providers. Through comprehensive security analysis and experimental demonstration, we have demonstrated the advantages of T-ABE in practical applications. We are confident that this new scheme has the potential to effectively tackle the outsourced key escrow challenges encountered by ABE.}

By placing critical code and data inside TEE, smartphone apps ensure their confidentiality and integrity, even with a compromised outside system. However, there is a lack of studies on the usage of TEEs on smartphones. To that end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, demystifying smartphone-based TEEs, TEE-based apps, and their interactions. Specifically, our study answers threefold questions: (1) how are TEEs designed for smartphones, (2) what do the TEE-based apps look like, and (3) how do these apps use TEE? To answer these questions, our research investigates 17 TEE systems and more than 10,000 real-world Android apps across over 50 regular and malicious app categories. To automate the investigation, a tool that detects if an app uses TEE (i.e., TEE-based apps) has been provided. Our findings can provide practical guidance for app testers to generate valid TEE test cases, for TEE vendors to optimize their TEE solutions, and for security researchers and developers to enhance their protection mechanisms.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an indispensable role in many industries, exhibiting distinctive value and potential. However, there are lots of common threats in UAV networks, such as black hole attacks and message tampering. Additionally, as the size of UAV Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) gradually increases, the network overhead and latency also increase. To address these issues, we propose a Trust Model with Fitness-Based Clustering Scheme (TMFCS) in FANETs. TMFCS integrates the trust model and clustering scheme, aiming to improve network security and reduce network overhead. Specifically, TMFCS focuses on unintentional abnormal behavior (e.g. packet loss due to low energy) and message characteristics (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, and integrity) in the trust evaluation. In addition, TMFCS integrates the fitness-based clustering scheme. The scheme selects cluster heads based on density, trust, and energy, which can effectively ensure clustering security and reduce the network overhead. Meanwhile, TMFCS introduces a cluster maintenance phase to improve network topology stability, by reducing the clustering times. Extensive experiments have shown that TMFCS has higher detection performance than other baseline models, while ensuring clustering security and topological stability.}

	abstract = {Trust-based collaborative filtering methods exploit trust information to alleviate cold-start and data sparsity problems and improve recommendation performance. Instead of modeling trust itself, most existing approaches rely on trust connections sourced from online social networking platforms. Typically, users engage with products on rating platforms and interact with friends on social networking platforms, exhibiting distinct behavior patterns. Therefore, simply aggregating information and misinterpreting user preferences may lead to information misuse and recommendation bias. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces three trust measurement models to capture and quantify trust relationships directly from user-provided ratings. Utilizing the trust-weighted scheme, we propose a hybrid collaborative filtering approach called Trust Weighted Collaborative Filtering (TWCF). Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the trust information extracted from rating data and the trust-weighted scheme can significantly improve the performance of original neighborhood collaborative filtering. TWCF achieves an average improvement of 7.12% in prediction accuracy over the trust-based collaborative filtering baselines. Furthermore, the interpretability and scalability of TWCF provide opportunities for further improvement by incorporating more appropriate trust measurement models.}

Therefore, we revisit the image transformations implemented in the literature and evaluate them in terms of runtime. In order to build an image transformation ensemble that is applicable for real-time use and guarantees the same level of security. We implement an extendible framework for the runtime analysis of image preprocessing functions to obtain comparable results for these metrics. We introduce several new transformation functions across both new and existing groups: Denoising, Geometry, Color Correction, and Morphology. These functions can replace computationally inefficient ones, potentially leading to runtime improvements of 71.03%. Furthermore, by substituting these functions, we achieve an increase of over 14% in benign and adversarial accuracy.}

Graph Federated Learning (GFL) is a method that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global graph neural network using a federated learning framework. This approach leverages the value of distributed graph data while maintaining data privacy. Existing approaches optimize graph neural networks within the common FedAvg paradigm, but they face two problems. The first problem is data heterogeneity, which leads to variations in label distributions and subgraph structures across clients. The second problem involves isolated nodes that possess limited or no local connections. The two problems seriously degrade the performance of GFL. To address these issues, we introduce FedSGProx, a novel GFL approach. FedSGProx combines longterm and short-term constraints to mitigate local biases due to data heterogeneity. Moreover, we design a novel sampling strategy to limit the involvement of isolated nodes in local training, thereby reducing their negative impacts on local models. Empirical results show that FedSGProx achieves higher classification accuracy than existing methods, and its performance is very close to that in centralized training.}

	abstract = {Blockchain with its decentralization, anti-tampering, traceability, anonymity and other technical characteristics, which provides mitigations to society issues such as data governance, information silo. However, the blockchain has inherent technical shortcomings such as its data openness and transparency and data permanent storage and other characteristics, which leads to security issues cannot be ignored, and may be subject to BGP hijacking attacks, distributed denial of service attacks, and node vulnerability attacks, which will bring greater risks to some private information, so an important alternative is to apply the covert channel. In this paper, we propose a secret embedding scheme based on Bitcoin transactions pattern controlling, where miner behaves secret embedding based on each single block transaction counts under block generating process. Our scheme adopts Gray code encoding to preprocess the covert information to be transmitted to improve the robustness of the scheme, uses transaction counts as a carrier and constructs a mapping table between transaction counts and secret information, which is embedded by intentionally modulating the transaction counts in the candidate blocks. Moreover, the distribution pattern of public traffics is simulated, so that the generated covert traffics are of undetectability. The implementation of our scheme is established under the real transaction scenarios, and our performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is stealthy via KS test and KLD test, in addition, compared to the existing blockchain covert storage channel schemes based on transaction modification, our scheme’s overhead of transaction fee is zero.}

	abstract = {Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), attackers can precisely detect users' online activities through traffic monitoring, nullifying the efficacy of current encrypted communication tools/protocols and progressively resulting in privacy leakage. Several defensive methods against DNN-based traffic monitoring (DTM) have been proposed; however, these methods often rely excessively on prior knowledge and incur inevitable additional bandwidth overhead (BWO). Moreover, they frequently generate invalid packets that violate network transmission constraints. To address these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose BYTEFLIPPING, a byte-space grey-box defensive method, which perturbs vulnerable bytes in the transport layer payload to generate adversarial sample packets. We design a Payload Byte Vulnerability Ranking algorithm to pinpoint the most vulnerable bytes and based on this generate adversarial packets to defend DTM. Extensive experiments reveal that ByteFLIPPING performs well in protecting against three DTM methods across two benchmark datasets, significantly decreasing the accuracy of the state-of-the-art ET-BERT by 94%. Compared to baseline defensive methods, BYTEFLIPPING incurs no extra BWO, offers more dependable packet validity, and boasts greater feasibility.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of Android malware presents significant challenges to the security of the Android operating system. Malicious packet detection is a critical technique in combating Android malware. Android malicious packet detection often includes packet capturing and detecting the packets through machine learning or deep learning models. Nonetheless, evolving malware with anti-packet capturing measures, disrupts packet capturing and diminishes the performance of malicious packet detection models. To address these challenges, we propose ePacket, a novel framework for capturing Android malicious packet. By leveraging eBPF technology, ePacket captures application level packets from apps at the Android kernel, effectively circumventing anti-packet capturing strategies employed by malware. Additionally, we have compiled a summary of anti-packet capturing strategies observed in real Android malware. We evaluate ePacket using over 3,000 apps. The results demonstrate that ePacket effectively circumvents anti-packet capturing strategies and captures a significantly higher volume of malicious packet (up to 30% more) compared to other three state-of-the-art tools.}

	abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence is important information for analysing cyber threats. Most of the research focuses on extracting threat entities from threat intelligence and constructing knowledge graphs, with less research on reasoning on the threat intelligence knowledge graph. Existing research has limited ability to reason about implicit information in the threat intelligence knowledge graph and is not interpretable. In addition, the amount of information contained in the threat intelligence knowledge graph has an inherent upper limit, and the existing multihop reasoning methods are also constrained by the limitation caused by the knowledge graph, which affects their performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop reasoning framework for the cyber threat intelligence knowledge graph, which uses a language model for multi-hop reasoning, views the reasoning process as a sequence-to-sequence task, and generates multihop reasoning paths based on reasoning queries. To alleviate the limitation of the threat intelligence knowledge graph, we inject external knowledge graphs into the language model and add a rule enhancement strategy, and the experimental results show some improvement in multi-hop reasoning performance and interpretability.}

	abstract = {In the network layer of the Ethereum network, the Discv5 protocol is introduced to improve the node discovery process and enhance resistance to common P2P network attacks such as Sybil Attacks, Partition Attacks, and Eclipse Attacks. However, the practical effectiveness of the new security mechanisms introduced by the Discv5 protocol has not been evaluated through engineering assessments. In this paper, we identify inconsistencies between the design and implementation of the Discv5 protocol and propose a new attack pattern: the Leveraging Service Diversity (LSD) Attack. The LSD Attack targets networks where different services are indiscriminately mixed. Through detailed measurements of the Consensus Layer (CL) discovery network, we evaluate the impact of the LSD Attack on newly joined network nodes and on the services of honest nodes within the network. Our experiments demonstrate significant deviations between the Discv5 protocol’s current implementation and its original design, which can lead to a substantial reduction in the network’s security under the influence of service diversity. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the security implications of the Discv5 protocol and highlights the need for further evaluation and improvement of the network layer protocols in Ethereum.}

	abstract = {Authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols are widely deployed in many real-world applications to secure communication channels. Recently, side-channel attacks have been conducted to defeat traditional cryptographic protocols because a side-channel adversary can retrieve partial content of secret keys. Several leakage-resilient AKE (LRAKE) protocols have been presented to resist such attacks. However, existing LRAKE protocols are not suitable for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment due to their expensive public-key cryptographic operations. Even worse, IIoT devices have few security protection measures, making them very vulnerable to side-channel or information leakage attacks. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a novel lightweight LRAKE protocol called LLRAKE. By leveraging lightweight cryptographic primitives such as hash function, symmetric encryption, and secret sharing scheme, our protocol achieves dual objectives of perfect forward secrecy and leakage resilience. The sole reliance on lightweight cryptographic operations ensures that LLRAKE is well-suited for resource-constrained IIoT devices. Moreover, we give the formal security result of the proposed protocol in the random oracle model.}

	abstract = {Inadequate network configurations can lead to serious security issues. Current research, however, overlooks the integrity of the network in identifying security issues from configurations. Specifically, it lacks sufficient integration of multi-level information and lacks a certain level of scalability when facing different network situations. This paper introduces ConfigKG, a general, extensible, and comprehensible framework for identifying security issues from configurations in a network. ConfigKG utilizes configuration files to create a knowledge graph, which assists in reasoning and mining network information. Through this process, ConfigKG models networks in knowledge graphs. Drawing from properly configured routing protocol scenarios, this study translates the standard network state into a series of graph-based rules that are applied across network planes. By evaluating these rules, ConfigKG can determine the network state and find errors in configurations. This article focuses solely on identifying security issues in the configuration of routing protocols, as routing security is the primary concern related to configuration problems. An experimental scenario was conducted to assess ConfigKG, which successfully constructs a knowledge graph and accurately models the network, enabling finding security issues through rule set checks. During the experiment, ConfigKG effectively identifies misconfigurations in OSPF and BGP, as well as prefix hijacking. Additionally, ConfigKG demonstrates scalability by accommodating additional mining algorithms and rule sets, allowing for customized adjustments based on detailed requirements.}

	abstract = {While text-based captchas, designed to distinguish between human users and bots, have encountered numerous attack methods, they remain a prevalent security mechanism employed by various websites. Some deep learning-based approaches can recognize captcha character sequences end-to-end; however, the labor-intensive and time-consuming labeling process severely restricts their feasibility. In this study, we introduce CaptchaSAM, to segment anything in text-based captchas. Our insight lies in the fact that identifying individual characters is a simpler task compared to recognizing character sequences, leading to a substantial reduction in labeling dependency. To accomplish this, we utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for character-level semi-automatic annotation. Subsequently, we leverage the annotated data to train a semantic segmentation model. Our experiments with real-world captcha systems demonstrate that CaptchaSAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with just a few labeled captchas. We anticipate that our research will encourage security experts to reconsider the design and deployment of text-based captchas.

In this paper we utilize unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm to perform downlink ISAC transmission to serve multiple terrestrial legitimate users and sensing targets. To accommodate more practical application scenarios, we assume that there are also multiple malicious eavesdroppers in the network attempting to eavesdrop on the confidential signal. In order to enhance the security of the downlink transmission while maintaining sufficient sensing performance, we propose a joint optimization of the centralized trajectory of UAV swarm, the transmit beamforming on each UAV, and the ISAC schedule, which is eventually formulated as an average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problem. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is developed to solve the considered optimization problem and its effectiveness is validated via experimental simulations, which also proves its superiority over benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Enterprises face increasingly complex and frequent security threats, presenting significant challenges for timely prevention and response. Traditional log-based intrusion detection systems often rely on known attack signatures, limiting their ability to detect novel or evolving threats. Supervised anomaly detection methods, while leveraging machine learning techniques, are constrained by the scarcity of labeled attack samples, leading to gaps in detecting real-world attack variations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight anomaly detection framework tailored for relatively stable server environments. The approach constructs provenance graphs from audit logs, extracts local subgraphs centered on process nodes, and utilizes Simhash for semantic embedding and frequency analysis. By combining locality-sensitive hashing with the K-medoids clustering algorithm, the method establishes a robust normal behavior model to detect anomalies. Experimental evaluations on public datasets and high-performance computing platforms demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 97% detection accuracy while significantly reducing the time costs compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {Machine learning methods have shown significant advantages in detecting malicious traffic, particularly identifying zero-day attacks and unknown threats. However, existing detection methods based on statistical features are susceptible to deception and evasion by attackers, resulting in reduced detection accuracy and challenges in achieving fine-grained detection. To address these issues, we propose FREDet, a fine-grained malicious traffic detection method based on frequency domain features. FREDet employs discrete wavelet transform to extract frequency domain features from network traffic and incorporates a new traffic aggregation method, significantly enhancing feature representativeness and detection accuracy for robust, fine-grained detection. Experiments on a multi-type attack dataset demonstrate that FREDet can detect malicious traffic with high precision, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracies of over 98.63% and 99.93% in detecting fine-grained attack categories and known attack subcategories, respectively.}

	abstract = {With the continuous breakthroughs in deep learning within the field of computer vision, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring image-based Android malware detection. For example, recent years have seen widespread application of Vision Transformer (ViT) models in Android malware detection, which have demonstrated significant effectiveness. However, ViT-based Android malware detection methods still face challenges, such as the loss of local features and insufficient capture of edge information and texture features, which limit their detection capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Android malware detection method based on multi-feature fusion RGB images and the SC-ViT model. The SC-ViT model consists of two branches: the SC (Swin-Transformer CBAM) branch is responsible for extracting global information and capturing long-range dependencies, while the SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Net, SPP-net) branch focuses on extracting multi-scale spatial features. These features are subsequently fused using an IAFF(Iterative Attentional Feature Fusion) module. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a detection accuracy of 99.50% and a detection precision of 99.23%, significantly surpassing the 96.82% accuracy achieved by the baseline ViT model, demonstrating its superiority and innovation in Android malware detection tasks.}

	abstract = {Software reverse analysis is a key technology in the field of cyber-security. With the increasing scale and complexity of software, this technology is facing great challenges. Binary code modularization (BCM), as the basic work of software reverse, plays an important role in extracting semantics, narrowing the analysis scope and locating key position. The semantics of strings underlying code is a significant hint, with being processed using natural language processing and artificial intelligence technology help to reverse analysis effectively. However, most of the existing modularization methods ignore these semantics, which limits the in-depth understanding of binary code. This paper proposes a semantic-driven reverse engineering framework for binary code modularization (SBCM). Firstly, the rich string is extracted from the binary file into a large language model for semantics analysis. Then, the semantic information of the string is combined with the control flow graph to construct the function semantic graph (FSG). Subsequently, a function summary is generated based on the FSG. Finally, semantic embedding is generated for Summaries and semantic-driven integrated clustering is carried out to realize binary code modularization. The experiment results show that SBCM improves the F1 value by 12.6% on average compared with the existing methods, which proves its effectiveness and superiority in binary code modularization.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the growing complexity of industrial production processes, data interactions between IIoT domains have become increasingly frequent. Ensuring security and privacy in cross-domain authentication has thus become a critical challenge. Traditional authentication schemes face several limitations, including high computation overhead, potential privacy leakage, and vulnerability to single point of failure, making it difficult to meet the cross-domain authentication needs. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed cross-domain authentication scheme in this paper. Specifically, we first design a novel IIoT cross-domain authentication architecture based on multi-blockchain. Unlike traditional single-blockchain based architecture, this approach enables fine-grained access control for on-chain device information and provides better performance and scalability. Building on this architecture, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme utilizing Certificate-Less Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC), ensuring identity privacy for industrial devices while maintaining low authentication resource overhead. Additionally, we adopt the Merkle hash tree to construct a novel pseudonym management mechanism, which supports efficient batch pseudonym request, verification, and revocation. Finally, we demonstrate the scheme’s advantages in security and efficiency through comprehensive security analysis and performance evaluation.}

	abstract = {In the field of cybersecurity, increasingly emerging network threats seriously affect the security of network and users. Notably, DDoS attacks represent a critical concern due to their capacity to inundate and debilitate targeted systems via distributed networks. This study introduces a DDoS attack detection framework employing a dual-detection model designed to identify both conventional and adversarial DDoS attacks. Adversarial DDoS attacks are characterized by their enhanced capability to circumvent standard DDoS detection mechanisms. The proposed framework incorporates an optimized CNN architecture for the detection of traditional DDoS attacks. This optimization involves substituting fully connected layers with global average pooling layers, an approach validated through comparative experimentation to yield the most effective base CNN model. For the detection of adversarial DDoS attacks, we propose a new detection algorithm, in which methodology initially employs the WGAN-GP data generation process to create synthetic DDoS attack data, followed by the strategic alteration of certain feature values within the generated attack data using normal traffic data. The resultant perturbed data are then utilized to train the adversarial DDoS attack detection model. Empirical assessments performed on the CIC-IDS2017 and CIC-DDoS2019 datasets confirm the efficacy of the dual-detection model in accurately identifying both traditional and adversarial DDoS attacks, achieving an accuracy exceeding 95%.}

With Android being the most popular mobile operating system, Android-based smartwatches, such as those powered by Google’s Wear OS, have become increasingly popular. However, the customization of smartwatch firmware by manufacturers, while improving user experience, poses significant security risks. This study conducts a comprehensive security analysis of Android smartwatch firmware, focusing on security configurations, patch management, and pre-installed applications. Through the analysis of 176 firmware images from 24 vendors, the study identifies 1,684 insecure configurations resulting from customization, significant delays in applying security patches, and reveals that 26.1% of pre-installed apps have potential security risks. These findings underscore security concerns in Android smartwatch firmware and highlight the need to prioritize security in firmware development and customization practices.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of cloud storage, effectively identifying and eliminating redundant data among users while ensuring data security has become a significant challenge. However, traditional similarity detection methods has limitations in privacy protection. Although conventional encryption techniques can safeguard privacy, they have difficulty detecting redundancy between similar blocks. Thus, we propose a secure reduction of redundant and similar data for cloud storage to address these challenges based on zero-knowledge proof (Sec-Reduce), called Sec-Reduce. It first employs a novel zero-knowledge proof technique for file-level redundancy detection, where redundant files are identified and excluded from storage. To further determine the similarity of non-redundant files, the scheme performs content-based chunking and feature extraction using a similarity feature extraction method. These extracted features are then encrypted using the approximate homomorphic encryption scheme Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) to enable similarity detection in the ciphertext environment. Finally, secure delta encoding is applied to store unique ciphertext blocks and deltas. Evaluations of real-world datasets demonstrate that Sec-Reduce achieves higher storage savings than existing encrypted storage methods, with storage overhead comparable to plaintext storage and only moderate performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Efficient power management in smart grids relies on regularly obtaining the electricity usage of each user. However, the aggregation of the electricity usage data may expose user privacy. At present, most existing solutions aggregate the electricity data of the entire user set, which cannot meet the fine-grained requirements of the control center. Therefore, this paper proposes a verifiable privacy-preserving multisubset dynamic billing data aggregation scheme. Firstly, we divide the electricity data into k consecutive subsets and set dynamic pricing rules, such as pricing within a certain range as q1 and exceeding it as q2. Then, the smart meter encrypts the data using the Paillier cryptographic system with the corresponding subset of parameters and uploads them to the aggregation equipment. After the aggregation equipment completes the users’ data aggregation, the ciphertext C is sent to the control center. This process enables the control center to check data integrity and obtain the total number of people, electricity consumption, and costs for different ranges of electricity in a period of time at once, without the need to obtain data for individual users. Analysis and experiments show that this scheme can resist attacks from powerful adversaries on the transmission channel and has practicality and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Android’s popularity is due to its openness and vast app ecosystem. Global developers can use Android Studio and rich Android APIs to create their apps. Within this ecosystem, Android permissions play a crucial role in managing access to resources, with system permissions controlled by system apps and custom permissions declared by third-party apps. However, the security of custom permissions has not received enough attention from the mobile security community, resulting in a lack of thorough evaluation of security practices for app developers using custom permissions. This study systematically evaluated the misconfiguration of custom permissions by Android app developers. It is based on ten configuration guidelines derived from the Android development documentation, OS source code, and related research papers to ensure proper functioning and adherence to best security practices of custom permissions. The study established the corresponding violation rules and built a dataset containing 174,740 APK files for large-scale measurement and analysis of guideline violations. The measurement results indicate that misconfiguration of custom permissions by Android app developers is quite common, with approximately 29.02% of the 92,461 apps involving custom permissions having configuration guideline violations. The two most common errors in custom permission configuration are 1) putting custom permissions into a defective custom group and 2) protecting components with undeclared custom permissions. Such misconfigurations can lead to various issues, including private app data leaks, app installation failures, or incomplete implementation of app functions.}

	abstract = {The space-ground integrated networks (SGIN) is vulnerable to complex and evolving threats due to its open nature. However, the dynamic topology and limited resources of SGIN present significant challenges for security resource orchestration. Most existing studies focus on network function orchestration and resource allocation for service flows, overlooking the offensive and defensive characteristics of security resource orchestration. Moreover, they fail to adequately address the difficulties posed by the dynamic topology of SGIN. To address these gaps, we utilize a virtual node method and network structure characteristics to transform the dynamic network topology into a static scale-free network. The orchestration strategy generation problem is then modeled as a minimum spanning tree truncation game on the network. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose the OSG algorithm based on Benders decomposition to solve it. To further improve the OSG algorithm’s efficiency, we introduce an initial value algorithm and four cutting plane inequalities, culminating in the AOSG algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on networks of varying scales demonstrate that the AOSG algorithm, incorporating the initial feasible solution and Hamming inequality, delivers superior performance and generates optimal orchestration strategies within a feasible time frame.}

To overcome this challenge, we use reconfigurable intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to reconfigure channels to aid key generation. In this paper, we introduce a RIS-assisted key generation protocol and focus on minimizing bit disagreement ratio (BDR). We analyze the influencing factors of BDR, namely, the reconfiguration error during channel reconfiguration and the estimation error during channel probing. In our proposed scheme, we first select the corresponding quantizer according to the channel state information (CSI) in order to utilize the channel range as much as possible. Then, to minimize the BDR caused by the estimation error, we propose an optimization scheme of the phase shift matrix and give a closed-form solution. Meanwhile, we use channel quantization alternating (CQA) to reduce the impact of the reconfiguration error on BDR. Compared with existing benchmark schemes, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {APT attacks are becoming increasingly complex and stealthy. To effectively counter APT attacks, modelling threat intelligence data based on graphs, identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOC) nodes, and providing early warnings have become new research hotspots. However, the problem of node category imbalance in such graph datasets restricts the identification capabilities of these methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a supervised graph data augmentation method. In the training phase, graph disentangled representation learning is utilized to perform feature embedding for minority class nodes, effectively alleviating the sparsity problem faced by traditional methods and effectively integrating neighbourhood information of minority class nodes at a higher semantic level. Additionally, two loss functions designed based on link prediction and prototype constraints enhance node type consistency and semantic consistency, respectively. Experimental results on the APT and PDNS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline models in identification performance; even in highly imbalanced scenarios, it surpasses the second-best model.}

	abstract = {Network traffic represents the volume of data sent and received during online website visits. Anomalies in network traffic indicate unusual variations in traffic, which are crucial to detecting in a timely and accurate manner in complex computer network systems to ensure efficient operation. Existing methods for anomaly detection in network traffic have rarely focused on effectively handling time-series data in the temporal dimension. Addressing the limitations of traditional Temporal Convolutional Networks in capturing local and significant features of time series, this paper proposes the CTA-BiLSTM model. Convolutional Neural Networks extract local features from sequences, while Temporal Convolutional Networks learn abstract and high-level sequence patterns to capture long-term dependencies and hierarchical features. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks capture long-term dependencies from both directions, incorporating attention mechanisms in both Temporal Convolutional Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks modules. The CTA-BiLSTM model performs bidirectional temporal modeling of sequence features, capturing longterm dependencies and temporal patterns, thereby enhancing the capability to detect anomalous behaviors in network traffic. The proposed CTA-BiLSTM model is evaluated through experiments on a public network traffic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the CTA-BiLSTM model outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score.}

Existing cross-chain methods impose limitations, e.g., hash lock technology exhibits low scalability, side-chain technology is overly complex, and notary schemes pose centralization risks. In order to address these issues, we propose a cross-chain transaction solution based on proxy re-signature technology. To tackle the centralization concerns, we employ proxy re-signature technology to decentralize the authority of notaries among transaction participants, minimizing the potential for centralization at a low cost. We further present an extended scheme that can guarantee more requirements such as higher transaction amount and shorter transaction time. Furthermore, we analyze and compare the signature technologies used in the proposed solution and provide a systematic proof of our approach’s security.}

	abstract = {As an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being deployed, the threat from vulnerabilities inside these devices is growing. Fuzzing is a primary method used for discovering vulnerabilities in IoT devices. The quality of the initial seeds and the seed mutation strategy are two crucial components of fuzzing that largely determine the effectiveness of the fuzzing process. However, owing to the diversity of IoT devices and the highly structured nature of inputs, designing universal seed generation and mutation strategies is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose LLMUZZ, which is a large language model (LLM)-based black-box fuzzing approach for IoT devices. Specifically, we employ prompt engineering techniques in few-shot learning, using HTML form data from frontend files and an example HTTP request as inputs to LLMs to generate initial seeds. Then, we input the requests to be mutated into LLMs to identify the fields requiring mutation, thereby assisting in the seed mutation process. This approach ensures that the mutated seeds remain valid. Additionally, static analysis methods are utilized to discover hidden keywords within the firmware, thereby further expanding the initial seeds. In the experiments, we implement a prototype of LLMUZZ and evaluate it on 8 different IoT devices. A total of 16 previously unknown vulnerabilities are found, for which we have received 4 CVEs; the remaining vulnerabilities still under review, demonstrating that LLMUZZ has a strong capacity for vulnerability discovery.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are becoming increasingly prevalent in various fields, necessitating robust data security measures to safeguard sensitive information. While numerous studies have focused on securing data through advanced encryption schemes, they often overlook physical capture attacks, where the physical seizure of a UAV can result in the leakage of secret keys, rendering the encryption ineffective. To address this vulnerability, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as a promising solution, though their real-time integration into UAV networks remains under-explored. This article presents a comprehensive testbed that leverages hybrid FPGA-based SoC to evaluate the physical security of aerial communications. The setup integrates a Xilinx Zynq APSoC with a Raspberry Pi, that manages data flow and interfaces in the UAV system. Data exchange occurs through a client-server architecture between the devices. Autonomous flight control of the UAV is achieved using MAVROS, enabling communication between the host computer and the Pixhawk flight controller. A case study with modified Ring Oscillator PUF implemented on the FPGA is presented to enhance security. The PUF design is evaluated for its uniqueness and reliability, and the overall system performance is analysed in terms of end-to-end delay and resource utilization. The results are compared with state-of-the-art approaches to emphasize the improved performance and efficiency achieved.}

	abstract = {Active defense represents an asymmetric defensive strategy to reverse the imbalance between offense and defense. It primarily utilizes methods such as interference and deception to raise the cost of attacks and proactively identify potential threats. Within this field, active defense technologies leveraging deception tactics are regarded as a game-changer in cyber warfare. However, existing deception-based defense technologies predominantly focus on attack detection and mitigation, neglecting the possibility of fundamentally resolving the issue, namely preventing attacks by deterring potential adversaries. Recognizing vulnerabilities as the core of cyber warfare, this paper applies the concept of trap deception to vulnerabilities, proposing an active defense technique that confuses and deters attackers. This technique is triggered only when vulnerabilities are exploited, so it can detect, prevent, and trace attacks without impacting the program’s operation. This paper elaborates on the defensive philosophy of this technique and describes its implementation strategies. We argue that this approach holds significant promise in deterring attackers effectively, thereby mitigating the offensive-defense imbalance in cybersecurity.}

	abstract = {Identifying vulnerable code is crucial to software system security. With the rise of deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have received much attention for detecting vulnerabilities. While many studies aim to enhance GNN performance by refining graph structures, improving datasets, or optimizing model architectures, three key questions remain unanswered: 1) How do simple graph structures impact model performance? 2) How similar are artificially generated datasets to vulnerable code in the real world? 3) Does a more complex model provide better benefits in vulnerability detection? To find answers to these questions, we did experiments to show how basic graph structures affect GNN models and give guidelines on how to choose datasets. In addition, we introduce VulGCANet, a model with a relatively simple architecture that utilizes code property graphs and combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers for vulnerability detection. The experimental results demonstrate that VulGCANet exhibits 30% improvements in recall while performing similarly to other graph neural network-based models, highlighting the importance of reducing the complexity of GNN model architectures in graph-based vulnerability detection. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing GNN-based vulnerability detection efforts.}

	abstract = {In recent years, online social networks (OSN) have rapidly gained popularity worldwide, becoming important platforms for information dissemination. Cyber manipulators use OSN bots to disseminate harmful information and manipulate public opinion, which can engage in cyber violence and conduct financial crimes. Therefore, it is crucial to propose an effective detection solution for OSN bots as a matter of urgency. Different OSN bots exhibit distinct behavioral patterns compared to regular users due to varying behavioral preferences. Analyzing network behavior patterns can reveal the fundamental rules and anomalies of OSN bots, providing support for effective detection in order to gather evidence of any illegal activities. Traditional social bot detection methods based on user profiles or social relationships pose risks of infringing on user privacy. Therefore, we propose a new detection framework for OSN bots——OBTT model, which demonstrates significant advantages in identifying bot traffic to OSN and discovering behavior patterns of different types of bots. OBTT adopts a multimodal approach, integrating graph embeddings from raw traffic with sequential features, while incorporating temporal information to explore the regularities in bot action sequences. Using large-scale unlabeled data, we pretrain a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and fine-tune it with a small amount of labeled data to enhance the model capacity to detect various bot behavior patterns. Experiments conducted on our OSNBotTraffic5 dataset show that OBTT achieved an accuracy of 0.95, demonstrating excellent performance. Notably, this is the first time that different OSN bot behavior patterns have been identified in quasi-real time from the perspective of network traffic.}

	abstract = {Higher-order masking is an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks but is often perceived as impractical due to its cost. Recent advancements in parallelization technologies have made higher-order masking more feasible. However, the security of these implementations can be jeopardized by the parallelization methods used, as their theoretical assurances may not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we improve the security and efficiency of higher-order masking schemes for block ciphers through a refined bit-sliced implementation. Our method addresses lower-order leakage caused by bit interactions, which are prevalent in current schemes. We evaluated the efficiency of our approach across various widely used ARM and AVR platforms, demonstrating efficiency improvements across all test platforms. By optimizing the masking gadgets, our approach reduces the required clock cycles by 30% to 50% compared to the original implementation, across share numbers from 2 to 32 on the 32-bit ARM platform. We validate the enhanced security of our method through both theoretical analysis and practical leakage detection, proving its effectiveness against bit interaction leakage.}

	abstract = {Ascon algorithm has been selected by NIST for standardization of the lightweight cryptography, that will be used in embedded systems, IoT devices, and other resource-constrained devices. As a lightweight cryptographic algorithm, Ascon implementation requires less computation and memory. However, the current implementations of Ascon algorithms and existing protection schemes are vulnerable to side-channel attacks. In this paper, we propose an IPM (inner product masking) based protection for Ascon implementations. Our new masking scheme can prevent side-channel attacks from successfully retrieving the key, even when the leakage levels are nearly identical. Alternatively, the cost of obtaining the key can increase by several orders of magnitude, making the attack significantly more challenging. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated by porting it into a STM32F407 microcontroller and conducting correlation power analysis (CPA) and template attack (TA) on the collected power traces. The experimental results show that while CPA can successfully retrieve the keys from both the unprotected Ascon implementation and the Boolean-masked Ascon implementation, they fail against the new masking scheme. Although TA attacks can break the new scheme, they require approximately 50 times more data compared to attacking the Boolean mask. This demonstrates that the new masking scheme offers significantly greater security than both the Boolean mask and the unprotected implementations.}

	abstract = {With the deepening application of blockchain technology in the field of digital assets, the multi-chain environment combining main-chain and side-chain has gradually become mainstream. However, existing side-chain communication schemes have some shortcomings in terms of high concurrency and user privacy protection. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel zk-SNARKs method for cross-chain transactions. Specifically, we utilize non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to generate respective proofs on the side-chain. These proofs are highly effective in safeguarding the specific details of the transaction, such as user information and transaction amount. We design a multi-chain system framework by introducing a relay-chain between the main-chain and multiple side-chains. The relay-chain receives proofs from the side-chains, aggregates them into a single proof using recursive zero-knowledge proofs, and then sends the aggregated proof to the main-chain. The testing experiments demonstrate that, compared with traditional methods, our proposed method improves the overall blockchain system’s throughput and reduces the workload of the main-chain while ensuring transaction privacy.}

	abstract = {Active intrusion detection on network traffic streams becomes a crucial research problem, since it tries to maximize the effectiveness with limited labeled instances. The closely distributed anomalies of different categories and dynamic network traffic stream make it still quite a challenging issue. Therefore, we propose a Lightweight, Adaptive and Perspicacious Active Intrusion Detection method on network traffic streams, called LAPAID. We design novel lightweight anomaly detection clusters with density-aware hash cells, which successfully capture evolving data distribution. The anomaly detection clusters are incrementally updated in an approximate manner, and aggregated with a straightforward but effective metric divergences. At last, LAPAID detects anomalies and queries the instances for manual labels by measuring the density in hash cells of each cluster, effectively distinguishing closely distributed anomaly classes. Comprehensive experiments on several real-world data sets show that LAPAID outperforms previous methods, improving F1 scores by 16.17% on average.}

	abstract = {The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is widely used for communication in machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to its lightweight publish-subscribe model. Although MQTT can be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS), this introduces significant computational overhead on the message broker. We demonstrate that this overhead becomes unnecessarily high in subscription-heavy networks, where a single message must be encrypted individually for each subscriber. To address this issue, we present WHISPERMQTT, a solution designed to optimize the encryption process in MQTT brokers. Our approach utilizes both TLS and non-TLS connections with subscribers: the TLS channel is used to securely distribute a per-topic decryption key, while the encrypted payload is transmitted over the non-TLS connection. This allows the broker to encrypt each topic message only once, irrespective of the number of subscribers, which reduces processing overhead and enhances both latency and throughput. Importantly, WHISPERMQTT integrates seamlessly with the MQTT protocol and applications without requiring any modifications.}

	abstract = {In online encrypted traffic classification, existing machine learning methods face the challenge of manually extracting flow-level statistical features. Deep learning methods encounter complex preprocessing issues, requiring models to balance complexity and accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliable method for encrypted traffic classification based on attention mechanism. The method designs a neural network model based on the Transformer architecture. The model employs embedding operations to extract byte features and utilizes position encoding to capture spatial features, which enables efficient packet-level classification of encrypted traffic. By using only the first 40 bytes of the packet header as input, the model avoids analyzing the payload, thereby reducing the risk of privacy breaches. Moreover, the simplified input features reduce the time overhead for feature extraction, enhancing training speed and making the model suitable for deployment in high real-time scenarios. This paper validates the proposed method experimentally using two public datasets: ISCX VPN-nonVPN and ISCX Tor-nonTor. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving an improvement of at least 1.5% in classification accuracy and 1.6% in F1 score. Additionally, with a memory usage of 533 MB, it meets the performance requirements for low-resource scenarios.}

	abstract = {The security of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) is critical due to its widespread use. Attackers can exploit electromagnetic emissions from USB devices to steal sensitive information, and detecting controlled emissions from USB has long been a challenging issue. Existing methods for detecting controlled emissions based on radiated compromising emanations are often hindered by environmental noise, electromagnetic interference, and device variability, leading to reduced detection capability. To address these challenges, this paper, for the first time, proposes a method for detecting controlled emissions from USB devices through conducted compromising emanations. First, we construct a dataset of USB leakage signals based on conducted compromising emanations. Then, we propose a multiscale time-frequency processing technique for USB leakage signals, applying time-frequency analysis to generate spectrograms containing both time-domain and frequency-domain features. By leveraging multiscale data augmentation, the accuracy and generalization of detection model are enhanced. Finally, we employ a Residual Network to automatically extract features and detect abnormal signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively identify controlled emissions from USB devices, achieving an AUC of 99.52% and an ACC of 96.74%, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection and enhancing the security of USB devices.}

	abstract = {The development of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has significantly enhanced healthcare quality but has also introduced critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While effective in some cases, traditional flat classification models often struggle to maintain accuracy when dealing with closely related IoMT cyber threats. This work addresses the issue by proposing a novel approach using hierarchical classification techniques for cyberattack detection and classification. Unlike traditional flat classification methods, our hierarchical approach considers the relationships between attack classes, organizing them into a structured hierarchy. We utilize the CICIoMT2024 dataset, the first specific dataset for IoMT cyberattacks, to develop and evaluate our model. Our results indicate that the hierarchical approach demonstrated high accuracy and proposed the hierarchical consistency of the data, compared to baseline flat classification approaches. The study concludes that hierarchical classification techniques offer a more nuanced method for detecting closely related attack types and hold significant potential for improving IoMT security, particularly in more complex hierarchical scenarios. These findings contribute valuable insights to the field of IoMT cybersecurity, suggesting that further research into more intricate hierarchical structures could yield even more effective security solutions.}

	abstract = {Traditional Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Secure Neighbor Discovery (SND) are key elements for network functionality. SND is a hard problem, satisfying not only typical security properties (authentication, integrity) but also verification of direct communication, which involves distance estimation based on time measurements and device coordinates. Defeating relay attacks, also known as "wormholes", leading to stealthy Byzantine links and significant degradation of communication and adversarial control, is key in many wireless networked systems. However, SND is not concerned with privacy; it necessitates revealing the identity and location of the device(s) participating in the protocol execution. This can be a deterrent for deployment, especially involving user-held devices in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart environments. To address this challenge, we present a novel Privacy-Preserving Secure Neighbor Discovery (PP-SND) protocol, enabling devices to perform SND without revealing their actual identities and locations, effectively decoupling discovery from the exposure of sensitive information. We use Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for computing device distances without revealing their actual coordinates, as well as employing a pseudonymous device authentication to hide identities while preserving communication integrity. PP-SND provides SND [1] along with pseudonymity, confidentiality, and unlinkability. Our presentation here is not specific to one wireless technology, and we assess the performance of the protocols (cryptographic overhead) on a Raspberry Pi 4 and provide a security and privacy analysis.}

	abstract = {In an increasingly interconnected world, multi-domain networks serve as vital infrastructure, enabling seamless communication and resource sharing across diverse sectors, but also leading to increasingly frequent cyberattacks. Defense-in-depth (DiD) is widely regarded as a necessary strategy for mitigating these threats through layered security measures. However, current DiD strategies often fall short due to their single-domain focus, reliance on centralized control, and inability to adapt to dynamic threats. This paper proposes a novel framework to extend DiD strategies for multi-domain networks. It progressively defines key elements of multi-domain networks, culminating in a detailed hierarchical framework that clarifies the roles and interactions of management domains. Furthermore, cross-domain intrusion response is modeled as a multi-agent stochastic game, accounting for self-interested behavior and interactions between domains. The Independent Q-Learning (IQL) algorithm is employed to solve this game, with experimental results demonstrating substantial improvements in security across multi-domain environments.}

	abstract = {The applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have effectively managed complex tasks, expanded operational areas, and executed missions either autonomously or in collaboration. Group authentication for UAV swarms is essential to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of sensitive data. However, the highly dynamic nature of UAV networks makes the group authentication process challenging. Traditional centralized group authentication methods are susceptible to a single point of failure. In distributed group authentication schemes, issues such as key-escrow attacks, inefficiencies in cross-domain authentication, and challenges in domain isolation within identity data management continue to persist. This paper explores a scalable and efficient authentication scheme assisted by blockchain and group decentralized identifiers (BGAS), which utilizes group decentralized identifiers (GDIDs) to extend decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for group authentication. Security and performance analyses demonstrate that our protocol offers robust security against various common types of attacks and is more efficient than current authentication protocols in terms of storage costs and group authentication time.}

	abstract = {With the widespread application of gait recognition technology, the issue of gait semantic security in videos has also attracted the attention of researchers. Its goal is to destroy the readability of data while preserving its semantic features. Thanks to the development of deep learning, some existing methods both domestically and internationally have made certain breakthroughs in recognition accuracy and visual effects. However, there is still significant room for improvement in balancing protection ability, visual effects, and computational complexity. This work is based on the ability of deep learning networks to extract gait identity features. In response to some problems in the current research field, we propose a gait privacy protection algorithm based on Sparse Silhouette Jump(SSJ), which draws on the idea of gradient descent in adversarial attacks and transfers adversarial noise to binary jumps to better adapt to binary graphs, while limiting the range of jumps from the perspective of spatial sparsity to balance the effectiveness and concealment of attacks. Experimental results have shown that our method achieves good effectiveness and concealment for various gait recognition models.}

	abstract = {With the continued proliferation of wireless communication and mobile devices equipped with built-in GPS sensors, burgeoning applications of location-based services are springing up, such as mobile crowdsourcing applications (MCS), which are revolutionizing our daily lives. However, collecting and sharing continuously spatio-temporal data to a service provider of MCS applications will incur users' concerns about their privacy. In this paper, we study the problem of locally differentially private data aggregation over distributed spatial-temporal infinite streams. To this end, we proposed a LDP-based framework for dealing with the problem. Firstly, we propose a novel model of (w, ε)-Clustering-based Local Differential Privacy ((w, ε)-CLDP) to capture the temporal and spatial correlations in spatio-temporal infinite stream while guaranteeing stringent differential privacy. Secondly, we develop an efficient GRR-based Local Budget Absorption (LBA) mechanism as a building block for achieving (w, ε)-CLDP and present its privacy analysis. On this basis, we present a framework of real-time spatio-temporal data aggregation over distributed infinite streams with an untrusted server. Lastly, we conduct experiments on two real-world datasets to validate our framework. The results manifest that the LBA-based framework is optimal in data utility for real-time spatio-temporal data aggregation with a rigorous privacy guarantee.}

We introduce a device identification attack against DNS-over-HTTPS-enabled IoT devices. We conduct more than 25,000 automated experiments across 6 public DNS resolvers and find that the proposed attack can identify devices via DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) traffic with a 0.98 balanced accuracy.

	abstract = {The emergence of traffic monitoring systems aims to improve living standards, reduce environmental pollution and minimize the economic impact of traffic accidents. These systems mainly function by collecting user data for analysis and formulating corresponding countermeasures. However, the widespread collection of data inevitably raises concerns about the leakage of personal privacy, which is a key safety issue in traffic monitoring. Many researchers are now focusing on traffic flow data statistics, and researchers such as Mohammadali have used homomorphic encryption to design models that enable statistics while protecting user privacy. However, the associated encryption, decryption, and communication overheads are substantial. Therefore, we have moved away from traditional models and encryption/decryption algorithms, proposing a new, efficient, and lightweight system that leverages Distributed Point Functions (DPF) and Distributed Comparison Functions (DCF). This approach not only preserves user privacy but also significantly reduces overhead. Our system is built on a client dual-server framework, designed to withstand attacks from partially sincere adversaries, enabling third-party access to aggregated data or data exceeding a threshold of t, without compromising individual user privacy. Compared to existing related work, our method offers a substantial improvement in operational efficiency while maintaining the same level of communication overhead. Our research provides an advanced solution for aggregation scenarios in traffic monitoring systems, offering lower costs while ensuring robust user privacy. This work lays a strong foundation for the future development of comprehensive traffic monitoring systems.}

	abstract = {We present an efficient and simple multi-party private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocol that allows several parties to learn the intersection size of their private sets without revealing any other information. Our protocol is highly efficient because it only utilizes the Oblivious Key-Value Store and zero-sharing techniques, without incorporating components such as OPPRF (Oblivious Programmable Pseudorandom Function) which is the main building block of multi-party PSI-CA protocol by Gao et al. (PoPETs 2024). Our protocol exhibits better communication and computational overhead than the state-ofthe-art. To compute the intersection between 16 parties with a set size of 2 20  each, our PSI-CA protocol only takes 5.84 seconds and 326.6 MiB of total communication, which yields a reduction in communication by a factor of up to 2.4× compared to the state-of-the-art multi-party PSI-CA protocol of Gao et al. (PoPETs 2024). We prove that our protocol is secure in the presence of a semi-honest adversary who may passively corrupt any (t−2)-out-of-t parties once two specific participants are non-colluding.}

	abstract = {With the increasing demand for sensing data, the selection efficiency of task participants in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) becomes more and more important. How to efficiently choose eligible task participants while preserving privacy is an urgent issue. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving participant selection scheme based on location in MCS, named EPPS. Specifically, the k-anonymity technique is adopted to generate anonymous location matrices to preserve location privacy of sensing tasks and task participants. To improve selection efficiency, the anonymous location matrices of multiple sensing tasks are consolidated into a matrix called merged location matrix. Similarly, the anonymous location matrices of multiple task participants are also merged. Then, the cloud server computes the Hadamard product for merged location matrices to judge whether task participants locate in the corresponding sensing areas. By judging the merged location matrices of sensing tasks and task participants, multiple participants which satisfy the requirements of sensing tasks can be selected at the same time. Finally, the performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of efficiency, to be specific, the computation overhead of EPPS is decreased by 77% - 85%, the communication overhead of EPPS is decreased by 41%, the selection efficiency of the EPPS is increased by 66% when multiple task participants and one sensing tasks, and the selection efficiency of the EPPS is increased by 96% when multiple task participants and multiple sensing tasks.}

	abstract = {Graph node feature aggregation is a very common basic operation in graph data query and graph neural networks. We design three noised aggregation methods to protect the node features of the graph and analyze the privacy of these methods from the perspective of differential privacy. NAGG1, our first method, adds Gaussian noise to the aggregation result, extending the classic Gaussian mechanism of differential privacy directly to the graph domain. Subsequently, we design NAGG2 which adds noise to the raw data of each sample and then performs the aggregation. This makes it possible to decouple the data owner and subsequent data users. We impose some restrictions on the original definition of differential privacy, and under these new assumptions, we demonstrate that the effects of Gaussian noise in NAGG2 can be achieved with any other type of noise that meets the requirements. We call this method NAGG3, which significantly enhances the flexibility of added noise in theory. For these methods, we instantiate them with mean aggregation and graph convolutional aggregation. We analyze their privacy protection using the framework of differential privacy and evaluate their utility through experiments.}

	abstract = {The increasing costs of data breaches have made enhancing security and privacy measures more critical than ever. Static taint analysis has become a key technique for tracking sensitive data propagation. However, existing tools such as FlowDroid and Tai-e face significant challenges related to performance, precision, and the handling of complex taint propagation behaviors, such as those involving arrays and taint elimination. In response, we present EffiTaint, a novel static taint analysis tool. EffiTaint constructs the Pointer Flow Graph (PFG) on demand and employs a taint-driven selective analysis strategy, avoiding the overhead of constructing a complete call graph. EffiTaint enhances the modeling of taint propagation within arrays and taint elimination in program control flows, thereby effectively reducing the generation of erroneous sensitive data flows. Finally, EffiTaint optimizes the source and sink matching strategy using a method extension algorithm, significantly improving the ability to detect taint flows. Benchmarking results demonstrate that EffiTaint achieves high precision (97.5%), high recall (96.7%), and low overhead (average runtime of 26.93 seconds, memory usage of 0.67 GB), making it an effective solution for enhancing privacy and security in Java programs.}

	abstract = {Being carried everywhere by end-users, smartphones constantly gather user data, some of which are private (e.g., geolocations) and others public (e.g., accelerometer readings). To protect against data leakage attacks, most mobile platforms implement permission schemes that restrict access only to private rather than public data. Ironically, such unprotected public data can be craftily exploited by attackers, resulting in an emerging threat of leaking users’ private information, which we refer to as a Mobile Public-to-Private (MP2P) attack. However, for this particular attack, the current surveys lack details and need more focus on its distinct features, while the proposed attack methods have become increasingly similar. To better understand the MP2P attack, we conducted an in-depth study of academic examples spanning over a decade (2012-2024). Specifically, we first investigate and categorize public resources that can be exploited to leak private information. Then, we systematically explore the standard workflow and methodologies of MP2P attacks. Further, we propose a new MP2P attack method within a typical user scenario, taking flight. Based on our experiments with real flight trips, our method successfully infers passengers’ flight numbers, departure locations, destinations, and routes. Having deeply analyzed MP2P attacks and unveiled a new attack method, this paper can assist security engineers in devising countermeasures against this attack.}

	abstract = {Single-sign-on authentication (SSO) enables a user to obtain a token from an identity server, and access multiple service providers with the token. In conventional SSO, the identity server can identify the user through the token, which compromises the user’s privacy. Anonymous SSO is proposed to solve this problem. However, the unconditional anonymity precludes identification of fraudulent users and leads to increase in illegitimate activities. In this paper, we propose SONAR, an anonymous single-sign-on authentication protocol that supports fraud detection. The identity server first accesses a user’s trustworthiness using fraud detection. We observe that directly refusing to issue tokens to an untrustworthy user allows the user to immediately realize that he have been detected, which poses security problems. Instead, we postpone the moment the user realizes he has been detected until he attempts to access a service provider. We also illustrate the benefits of this postponement using denial of service attacks as an example. In the proposed SONAR, the identity server issues the user (regardless of his trustworthiness) with a token that contains a covert channel, which is restricted to conveying only a 0/1 bit that is hidden from the user. The restriction of the channel prevents the identity server from tracking the user by embedding specific information in the channel, and meanwhile the 0/1 bit indicates whether the user is trustworthy or not. The token is actually a randomizable signature and can be randomized by the user, while the embedded bit remains unchanged. The user accesses a service provider with a randomized token, which protects the user from being identified as well as informs the service provider whether the user’s access should be permitted. We provide a formal security proof to demonstrate that SONAR is secure, and conduct a performance evaluation to show efficiency of SONAR.}

	abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing services have grown rapidly, with people outsourcing huge amounts of private data to cloud servers. Searchable encryption(SE) facilitates people’s use of data while protecting data privacy. To balance the efficiency, current SE schemes still leak information such as access, search and volume patterns to cloud servers, and most dynamic SE schemes leak forward and backward privacy, and these leaks create serious security threats. In this paper, we propose a dynamic SE scheme DMASP with suppressed leakage, which protects access pattern, search pattern and volume pattern simultaneously. We utilize the differential privacy mechanism to obfuscate databases, and introduce the CKKS algorithm to protect access and volume patterns during queries. Meanwhile, we design a secure structure to index databases efficiently, and protect forward and backward privacy during updates. We rigorously analyse the security of DMASP. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental evaluation show that DMASP can reduce the accuracy of attacks against patterns leakage in real-world databases.}

Despite the global enactment of privacy protection laws, ensuring compliance in mobile applications remains complex. We propose a deep learning-based detection technique that focuses on detecting the compliance of mobile applications at the level of privacy policy statements and code behaviors. We have developed a hierarchical classification system that sorts privacy statements into primary and secondary categories, aligning them with relevant privacy regulations and associated code actions. Our research introduces an automated dual-detection system that utilizes the BERT pre-trained model alongside convolutional neural networks to execute multilabel classification of privacy statements, thus pinpointing the privacy management actions they describe. By employing static analysis, the study decomposes Android application package files to scrutinize their behavior and assess the alignment between code actions and privacy statements. The results of our experiments indicate that the proposed dual-detection system effectively identifies compliance issues in mobile applications, providing an innovative technical solution to enhance user privacy protection.}

	abstract = {This work addresses the problem of collecting multidimensional data while adhering to personalized local differential privacy. In this local context, each user possesses a data record containing multiple attributes. Due to variations in attribute sensitivity, privacy requirements of the attributes differ. Balancing personalized privacy needs of attributes with maximizing the accuracy of statistical results presents a significant challenge. The accuracy of estimation results is closely tied to the allocation of privacy budgets and user grouping. Consequently, we define an optimization problem: determining the allocation of privacy budgets to each attribute within the group and identifying the corresponding number of users in the group to ensure optimal estimation result accuracy while meeting privacy constraints. To simplify the complexity of this optimization problem, we introduce a progressive optimization method. This method initially groups attributes and subsequently fine-tunes and optimizes them. Practically, our approach meets the personalized privacy protection requirements of attributes. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves significant improvements in data utility.}

	abstract = {Local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as an advanced privacy protection method in local settings. However, due to the nature of perturbation locally in LDP, it may be susceptible to poisoning attacks by malicious users, significantly impacting the accuracy of estimation results. Existing works have demonstrated that interactive verifiable LDP protocols can effectively ensure the perturbation process and prevent output poisoning attacks. However, these works primarily focus on LDP protocols for frequency estimation. In this paper, our focus is on defending against output poisoning attacks in mean estimation for numeric attributes under LDP. We have selected a classic LDP mean estimation protocol for study, namely the Piecewise Mechanism (PM). Given that user data in the PM protocol consists of numeric attributes and its perturbation function follows a continuous probability density distribution, constructing a commitment vector poses a challenge. To tackle this issue, we propose a new method for constructing commitment vectors. This involves discretizing the attribute value domain and adjusting the perturbation probabilities using the minimum movement principle to mitigate the impact on the protocol. Additionally, we enhance the verifiable PM protocol using zero-knowledge proofs to bolster its effectiveness against output poisoning attacks in LDP. We conduct experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed interactive LDP protocols, showcasing the improved defense performance of our methods.}

	abstract = {We introduce a new lightweight Symmetric Threshold Predicate Encryption (STPE) scheme, which expands the definition of Predicate Encryption. In STPE, the recipient’s private key evaluates only k predicates instead of all predicates on the sender’s encrypted data. The recipient can decrypt the data if at least k predicates are satisfied. As a new building block, we design a Content-Filtered Encryption (CFE) scheme based on STPE, which allows the sender to encrypt the message with the extracted words and the recipient to generate a filter with abusive words. The recipient can decrypt the message if the evaluation of extracted words and abusive words does not intersect more than a threshold k, where k is a flexible limit of sensitive words the recipient can accept. Otherwise, the recipient can refuse to read the message. It is essential for the recipient to generate a filter of abusive words beforehand; the incoming encrypted message will be delivered only if it bypasses this filter. Therefore, our proposed scheme enables secure filtering of words in the end-to-end encryption messaging protocol, which achieves selective security and efficiency for all communication devices. We prove that our STPE and CFE schemes are secure under the selected security assumptions. Furthermore, by utilizing the Pseudo-Random Function and XOR gate, our construction achieves lightweight computation, which benefits from the primitives of symmetric crypto mechanisms. We experimented on multiple devices, such as PCs and mobile devices. Additionally, our work demonstrates the feasibility across heterogeneous devices.}

	abstract = {The rapid advances in deep learning have enabled the extraction of soft-biometric attributes from faces, raising privacy concerns regarding images collected for face recognition. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for multiple soft-biometric attributes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), aiming to effectively protect individual privacy while maintaining face recognition system performance. Our scheme incorporates two main modules: 1) The attribute encryption system, which identifies attributes to be hidden through chaotic cryptography and supports the recovery of original attributes. 2) Encoder features are adaptively transformed using Selective Transmission Units (STUs) within a generator featuring an encoder-decoder structure to generate perturbed images. The generated perturbed images are visually similar to the original images but differ in soft-biometric attributes. Experimental results show that our method maintains high face recognition accuracy while preserving privacy, and the quality of the generated images surpasses existing techniques.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has received widespread attention as a collaborative learning paradigm. Clients can collaboratively train a global model with server by uploading parameters instead of sharing the raw data, which guarantees the basic data privacy. However, recent research has highlighted that sensitive information can be inferred from shared updates or gradients, resulting in serious privacy leakage. Moreover, transmitting the updates or gradients can result in communication bottlenecks. In order to solve the privacy and communication problems, we propose a federated multilinear compressed learning framework (FedMCL), which considers the tensor structure of the data and performs multidimensional compression on the client’s raw data through multilinear compressed learning. Compared with vector-based compressed learning, it has better learning performance on multi-dimensional data. We generate proxy images from the measurement domain for training, which effectively defends against gradient inversion attacks. In addition, we introduce low-rank approximation method to compress model updates and reduce the communication overhead by transmitting small matrices instead of the original model updates. Experimental results show that our scheme can resist gradient inversion attacks under different compression rates while obtaining good classification performance, which has advantages in terms of privacy, performance and communication.}

	abstract = {In public and shared platforms where security is paramount, encrypted database storage and processing have become a key research priority. However, traditionally encrypted databases do not support direct computation of relational queries, and hence, those types of query processing are infeasible without intermediate decryption. To achieve end-to-end encrypted computation, such databases prefer fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which demands circuit-based representation of any algorithm. In our work, along with other encrypted SQL operations, we analyze SQL join and show straightforward implementation, which incurs huge performance overhead. Not only in performance, number of ciphertext expansions is also huge in this case, which can trigger a sharp rise in performance overhead in encrypted domain. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight solution only for joining the encrypted databases using pair-wise traditional column encryption with the introduction of primary and foreign keys. Then, we highlight how to perform homomorphic operations over that encrypted joining result. Our implementation shows 89.34% improvement compared to straightforward FHE-joining. Consequently, we demonstrate memory overhead reduction ∼13%.}

	abstract = {To address the ever-evolving network threats, system audit logs have become a crucial data source for threat analysis. While current log-based threat detection methods have significant potential in identifying malicious activities, they face limitations in capturing dynamic attack behaviors and revealing complete attack activities.To address these issues, we introduces DyCom, a dynamic graph partitioning technique based on audit logs. Our method incrementally partitions the system log streaming into multiple communities with security semantics, allowing the use of graph community summarization techniques to provide a summary of key activities within each community, thereby aiding security experts in understanding system activities. This method retains all attack activities, reduces analysts’ workload, and keeps them continuously informed about system activities. By focusing on process entities and constructing intimate process events, DyCom effectively reduces the storage cost of log data while ensuring the security semantics of the log communities. Additionally, DyCom employs temporal graph networks to dynamically represent system entities, ensuring real-time monitoring of system activities. Evaluations using the open-source DARPA TC dataset and our simulated datasets demonstrate that DyCom can accurately partition large-scale dynamic system entities into distinct communities, with improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score by 0.71, 0.31, and 0.65 respectively, compared to baseline methods, highlighting its practical potential in threat analysis.}

	abstract = {Cloud storage is widely used for flexible and efficient data management, yet redundant data across users requires storage optimization. Deduplication helps by storing only unique data, making data sharing and ownership verification essential post-deduplication. Current Proof of Ownership (PoW) methods rely on interactive communication, leading to delays and performance issues during intensive data operations, and often assume a level of trust that may not hold in practical scenarios. To overcome these issues, we propose ES-PoW, a non-interactive secure proof of ownership scheme for cloud storage. ES-PoW performs ownership verification in a single round, avoiding delays in block verification. Using modular exponentiation and the discrete logarithm problem, ES-PoW generates and verifies ownership proofs efficiently. Unlike previous schemes, ES-PoW is resilient against brute-force, replay, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks, without relying on trusted nodes, making it better suited to real-world applications. Experimental results show that ES-PoW reduces I/O operation time and accelerates computation, achieving up to 53.6× and 54.5× speed improvements over current methods.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of the Internet and the continuous evolution of digital media technologies, video stream has increasingly become a dominant part of overall Internet traffic. The spread of harmful videos in social networks makes it important to collect evidence and regulate them. With the growth of Internet video stream, identifying video titles in VPN encapsulated environments has become increasingly challenging, as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) encapsulate already encrypted video stream. To address this challenge, we extract stable video segments features from VPN encapsulated traffic based on DASH and HLS protocols, and then use these features to train hybrid CNN-LSTM models for accurate video title identification. Furthermore, the method filters background traffic and leverages unidirectional flow characteristics to handle asymmetric routing in real networks. Experimental results show that this approach achieves high accuracy, surpassing existing methods and demonstrates robustness when handling VPN encapsulated video streams, even under interference from background traffic and complex routing environments.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has emerged as a leading method for detecting network intrusion threats. However, processing large volumes of data increases computational time costs, and noise in the data can reduce detection rates. To address these challenges, feature selection algorithms are essential for balancing time efficiency and detection accuracy. Feature selection algorithms for intrusion detection systems (IDS) face two primary challenges: selecting the most suitable features for the model and managing data imbalances. Traditional methods often rely on manual selection based on feature importance, which can lead to significant computational errors. And they cannot detect attacks with smaller proportions in complex and variable network traffic. We design a secure network intrusion detection framework SecureNet-AWMI to balance attack distribution by augmenting the low-frequency attack samples and reducing the high-frequency attack samples. The core of SecureNet-AWMI is a feature selection component that uses mutual information theory and adjusts weights to account for different types of attacks. To enhance threat detection and classification, we employ an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model enhanced with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and an attention mechanism. Comparative experiments on three public datasets – CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, and NSL-KDD – show that SecureNet-AWMI outperforms current mainstream feature selection and threat classification techniques.}

This paper introduces a novel framework for automated metadata extraction from documents linked within a specified web page. The framework is designed to streamline Information Gathering processes by offering an easy-to-use, integrated, extensible, and flexible solution.

	abstract = {The (ab)use of encryption and compression in hiding illegal digital content complicates efforts by law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to procure evidence to support the elements of proof required in criminal prosecution. This reinforces the importance of designing solutions to determine the file type of an encrypted file (e.g., videos and still images in the context of illegal picture investigations), which can be used to build probable cause in a court order application to have the file decrypted. While machine learning (ML) has shown immense capabilities in several detection tasks, the suitability of ML for detecting file types in encrypted or compressed files has not been explored. Furthermore, since detecting file types in real-world LEA applications is a high-stake decision-making problem, existing ML techniques that do not provide prediction uncertainty are not as useful. In this work, we take the first step toward detecting file types in encrypted or compressed files using ML for LEA applications based on their Byte Frequency Distributions (BFD). We then compose a dataset  1  of BFDs of 300,000 encrypted and compressed data from 12,000 diverse files for five different file types. We conduct an in-depth analysis of our dataset and demonstrate the utility of ML techniques in detecting file types of content in encrypted and compressed files based on BFDs. Informed by these findings, we present our proposed framework, eDefender, designed to facilitate the detection of file types in encrypted and compressed files for LEA applications, by employing uncertainty quantification of detection scores based on ensembling. eDefender successfully flags directories with encrypted or compressed image/video-type files with an F1-score of 90.7%.}

However, deep learning models in side-channel attacks also face with the problems of excessive model complexity and long training time. In this paper, we introduce Broad Learning Systems (BLS) to power side-channel attacks (SCAs) and then construct an efficient model of broad learning for power SCAs from the core of BLS. Then we optimize the model by making full use of the excellent features of incremental learning and feature extraction of BLS. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the optimization model in diverse side-channel attack scenarios, achieving stable accuracy levels above 85% while significantly reducing time consumption compared to other models. This fully illustrates the superiority of our scheme.}

However, as the scale of networks continues to expand, the structure of networks becomes more complex, and the amount of data in the networks grows larger. Existing methods are facing numerous challenges, including difficulties in constructing training datasets for models, challenges in transferring and reusing models, and high costs associated with model training. This paper introduces a novel approach named BedIDS. This method involves constructing the evolutionary process of network behavior and calculating the evolutionary characteristics of network behavior. Using only the most fundamental five network traffic features, including IP addresses, BedIDS achieves rapid and accurate detection performance on a device equipped with a 3060ti graphics card. We conducted tests using the CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BedIDS maintains high detection accuracy and improves detection speed while requiring a relatively low AI computing force.}

Despite the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their potential for solving CTF challenges remains underexplored. In this paper, we first propose a flexible CTF platform designed to reflect real-world penetration testing scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical cybersecurity challenges. Our platform is highly customizable, freely deployable, and capable of generating scenarios that closely mirror real network vulnerabilities. More importantly, we introduce an automated LLM agent framework that tackles CTF challenges using an integrated toolchain and various plugins to enhance problem-solving efficiency. In addition, we propose a human-validated LLM agent framework to address the potential limitations of the fully automated LLM agent, providing a clearer evaluation of the LLMs’ intrinsic capabilities. We evaluate the agent’s performance using four LLMs: GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o1-preview, and o1-mini. Although the LLMs’ performance on dynamic and complex penetration tests reveals certain limitations, which need further exploration, our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can leverage their extensive knowledge bases to effectively solve CTF challenges.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for intermediaries or centralized control, offers a decentralized and transparent platform for distributed data storage and exchange. With the widespread application of blockchain, the amount of data stored on blockchain is rapidly increasing. As data is considered a potential commercial resource, it is critical to provide secure data query services in blockchain. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic skyline query, which is important in multi-objective decision-making, and propose a query framework to support efficient query processing and the authentication of dynamic skyline results. The key technique is the authenticated data structure (ADS) called the Grid-based Verkle tree (GV tree). It combines the grid-based index and the vector commitment. The minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) is used as the search key of the ADS. By pruning cells of the grid that are dynamically dominated by a data point, the GV tree filters out non-skyline points in a batch, thereby promoting query efficiency. By using the vector commitment, the GV tree enables the verification that data points are not tampered with using a small-size verification object. We present schemes for GV tree-based dynamic skyline query processing and result verification. We conducted extensive experiments, and the experimental results showed promising results for the query framework.}

	abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can enhance the safety of autonomous driving systems by sharing sensing data through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. However, ensuring the privacy, security, and accountability of shared data remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel lattice-based revocable ring signature (RRS) scheme for secure and privacy-preserving perception sharing in vehicular networks. The proposed scheme leverages the hardness of lattice problems, such as the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, to achieve post-quantum security. By incorporating a special revocable tag in the signature generation process, our scheme enables a trusted authority (TA) to revoke the anonymity of a misbehaving CAV and reveal its true identity when necessary. Furthermore, we provide formal security proofs demonstrating the scheme’s anonymity, unforgeability, and revocability under the random oracle model. A thorough performance analysis showcases the efficiency of the proposed scheme compared to existing solutions, demonstrating its practicality in vehicular networks.}

However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (termed AE-TW) is proposed in this paper, which focuses on attacks stemming from the automotive Ethernet on in-vehicle networks. We employ a semi-supervised machine learning method, AutoEncoder (AE) with time windowing, to train the normal profile for detecting anomalies. The proposed approach is implemented in a real-world vehicle testing environment. We evaluate the performance of the proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) using a synthetic dataset called EFA-IDS, which we generated, and the well-known TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high detection performance across different datasets and manifests low computation cost, making it highly applicable for real-time anomaly detection.}

	abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) have emerged as a security threat to the integrated circuits (ICs) industry. To counteract this threat, various detection methods have been proposed, among which conventional machine learning (ML)-based techniques using heuristic features from gate-level netlists have gained wide acceptance. However, these methods are notably sensitive to minor perturbations in modifications of the test circuits, often resulting in decreased detection capabilities. Furthermore, the black-box nature of the ML models obscures the basis for their decisions. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to scrutinize and address potential flaws in the models, thereby further reducing the credibility of Trojan detection results. In response to these challenges, we propose a targeted solution that leverages the SHapley Additive exPlanations method (SHAP), which dismantles the black-box paradigm and clarifies the fundamental reasons behind the failure of existing detection methods under circuit sample perturbations. Building on these insights, we abandon classical ML-based detection in favor of a scheme based on graph learning (GL), which significantly reduces the average drop in Recall from 52.35% to 7.29% compared with the traditional method. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our proposed GL-based method effectively resolves the sensitivity issue related to the sample perturbations in existing HT detection approaches.}

	abstract = {The increasing complexity of cyber threats necessitates advanced methods for understanding and countering adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Despite the support provided by the ATT&CK framework, challenges such as imbalanced sample distribution and technique overlap limit the effective mapping of complex attack patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates language models and advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including hierarchical attention embedding and contrastive learning, to achieve TTP recognition and classification in complex cyber threats. UniTTP consists of five modules: data processing, tactic classification, multi-feature embedding, techniques classification, and LLM post-assistance. By combining these modules, our method not only accurately identifies TTPs within cyber threats, improving the F1 score by 3.23% to 13.66% across different datasets, but also leverages the capabilities of large language models to verify recognition results and deepen the understanding of attack behaviors. This study lays the foundation for robust cyber defense by providing deeper insights into adversary behaviors and enhancing the predictability of complex threats.}

	abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) pose a significant threat to the security of integrated circuits(ICs). Measuring the vulnerability of ICs to HT insertions is crucial for enhancing design security, thereby mitigating potential security risks. This paper proposes a novel vulnerability measurement method for ICs against HT insertions based on node co-activation analysis. The method first transforms the circuit structure into a graph representation, where nodes represent circuit interconnections, and edges represent circuit components, using graph learning (GL) techniques. Next, it calculates the logical probability distribution and logic flip probability for each circuit node using simulation methods. By combining an adaptive threshold filtering strategy, the method identifies suspicious nodes in the circuit using simulation methods combined with an adaptive threshold screening strategy to identify suspicious nodes in circuits. Subsequently, it computes the joint probabilities of pairs of suspicious nodes that simultaneously exhibit rare logic values based on simulation results. Finally, the vulnerability of the circuit to HT insertions is quantified by evaluating the co-activation between pairs of suspicious nodes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed method.}

Existing research rarely considers the affinity between diverse tasks and heterogeneous resources, preventing the further improvement of system performance. This paper proposes a dynamic task scheduling approach based on the intelligent affinity strategy for cloud-edge-end collaboration. The affinity strategy depicts the preference of tasks for computing nodes with different labels, including resource types and node zones, and each task can set multiple affinity rules to match target nodes. Additionally, the proposed approach adopts deep reinforcement learning theory to generate the affinity rules, which means utilizing an intelligent algorithm to guide the rule generation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can reduce the average cost by at least 20% compared with the baseline.}

	abstract = {With the development of deep learning, especially driven by advanced models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), smart contract vulnerability detection is gradually moving toward automation and intelligence. Although existing deep learning detection methods have improved the efficiency of vulnerability detection to some extent, they fail to fully explore and utilize the rich syntactic and semantic information in smart contracts and generally suffer from insufficient feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a new method for smart contract vulnerability detection that combines a Multi-Information Contract Graph (MIG) with a Hierarchical Graph Feature Extraction model (HGFE). MIG integrates key information such as control flow, data flow, and vulnerability feature flow within smart contracts, fully mining and utilizing the rich syntactic and semantic features of smart contracts, providing the model with comprehensive feature representation. HGFE applies a multilayer feature extraction strategy, combining global and local feature extraction, and comprehensively considers multiple dimensions of information within the contract graph, thereby fully extracting the features of the contract graph. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the ability to detect potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, achieving a maximum accuracy and precision of 97.29% and 97.70%, respectively, outperforming other advanced methods.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, network structure has become increasingly complex, leading to more diverse and impactful network attacks. Traditional methods of detecting and defending against network attacks struggle with increasingly complex situations due to human decision-making processes. Recent research has started exploring autonomous defense mechanisms for network attacks within software-defined network (SDN) environments. However, these methods typically employ complex reinforcement learning techniques, making them challenging to implement in online deployment environments. In this paper, we propose LightRL-AD, a lightweight online reinforcement learning approach for autonomous defense against network attacks in SDN. LightRL-AD integrates a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a reinforcement learning-based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and a Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanism. The ML-based IDS classifies network flows into categories such as malicious or benign, while the RL-based IPS utilizes the SARSA algorithm to determine and execute appropriate defensive actions, ensuring robust network security. We employ specific hardware and software to establish a simulated SDN network for our experiments. And we implement LightRL-AD in the network and evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LightRL-AD performs better to defend against slow-rate DDoS attacks autonomously.}

	abstract = {For internet users, using digital identities has become increasingly essential. Traditional systems often rely on centralized control, which no longer meets privacy demands. Decentralized identity systems offer a more transparent and resilient solution by giving users control over their identity data through distributed ledgers, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials. However, existing schemes are often based on assumptions such as the presence of a reliable anonymous credential issuer, making them challenging to implement in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, they overlook handling user credentials securely and struggle with ensuring user authentication while providing privacy. These systems are unable to provide public audits of issued credentials without jeopardizing sensitive data. This paper introduces SPDID, a novel decentralized identity system based on blockchain technology is introduced. First, it transforms legacy documents into anonymous credentials without interaction or alteration using zero-knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments. SPDID also employs the physical unclonable function (PUF) to design a secure key management system resilient to physical attacks. Additionally, it suggests a user authentication method that is unlinkable and resistant to Sybil without the need for new trusted third parties. Furthermore, SPDID uses Merkle trees to construct a credential issuance list that is publicly auditable on the blockchain. The system’s security and practical performance are demonstrated through security analysis and a prototype implementation on Hyperledger Fabric.}

	abstract = {The ongoing race between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity hinges on who makes the first move. Defenders have a significant advantage if they can anticipate and counteract attacks preemptively. However, if attackers are aware of the defenders’ strategies, meaningful defense becomes exceedingly challenging. In this paper, we propose a reactive defense technique that adapts to the presence of attacks and mitigates their effects. We introduce an adversarial purification defense technique that leverages the capabilities of a diffusion denoising probabilistic model to eliminate adversarial noise. Through training the purifier and classifier independently on clean examples, our defense remains robust against unseen attacks, making it an agnostic defense method. We rigorously evaluate our defense technique using network intrusion datasets, demonstrating its superiority over other state-of-the-art defense techniques in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Our results demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly enhance the resilience of network intrusion detection systems against adversarial threats. To ensure the reproducibility of our results, we have made our implementation publicly available.  1}

	abstract = {In recent years, services based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention leading to more frequent interactions between users and LLMs. However, owing to the inherent characteristics of LLMs, user inputs are at risk of privacy leaks. While previous research has proposed methods for protecting user input privacy, many of these approaches face limitations, particularly in adapting to the dynamic and diverse nature of user interactions with LLMs. To address this challenge, our study approaches privacy protection from a user-centric perspective, employing detection methods to safeguard user inputs. Specifically, we compiled a comprehensive privacy list based on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements, defined the detection scope, and developed the PA-BERT model for automatically detecting privacy leaks in LLMs. By utilizing the PA-BERT-BiLSTM-CRF architecture, our method effectively monitors private information in user inputs. In our experiments, we not only utilized real-world datasets but also constructed a user input privacy dataset containing 15,036 privacy entities. Experimental results on the constructed dataset show that our method significantly outperforms commonly used general detection models in privacy detection, with marked improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score, making it more effective for identifying privacy in user inputs.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks have become a serious security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). The attacked model classifies samples with the trigger pattern as the target label while performing well on benign samples. However, existing backdoor attacks usually introduce significant perturbations in the spatial domain of samples, which reduces the stealthiness of these attacks. To balance the attack effectiveness and stealthiness, we propose a backdoor attack based on high-frequency component injection (HFI). This method is based on the observation that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tend to recognize textures. It injects the trigger into benign samples in the frequency domain with adjustable strength. In the spatial domain, it produces only subtle, nonlinear texture changes, ensuring that the poisoned samples do not introduce noticeable visual disturbances. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed HFI in terms of effectiveness, flexibility, and stealthiness, particularly on low-resolution datasets, where HFI outperforms the best baseline for stealthiness by factors of 10 and 100 in terms of the metrics mean squared error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), respectively.}

	abstract = {LLM has profoundly impacted various aspects of society, including public cognition and political systems. LLM has similar characteristics to human brain and is particularly susceptibility to external influences. As the social influence of LLM continue to expand, there is a growing need to strengthen its safety to reduce potential risks. This study considers habituation as a fundamental flaw of LLM and conducts necessary analysis in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science. The main findings show that that habituation causes the human brain and LLM to gradually lose sensitivity and tolerance to small changes, resulting in uncontrollable outputs. This root cause of this phenomenon lies in the scarcity of computing resources, which is an inevitable basic mechanism in complex situations, in either computer operation or biological brain function. This study hypothesizes that habituation can systematically induce malicious outputs in LLM. By analyzing common attacks on LLM, this study confirms that habituation is a key underlying principle that affects the effectiveness of these attacks. To further verify this hypothesis, two novel attack methods are proposed based on the analysis of habituation defects in LLM: the Repetition Exposure Effect Attack and the Progressive Sensitivity Reduction Attack. The Repetition Exposure Effect attack increased the average ASR (Attack Success Rate) from 0.1 to 0.5; The Progressive Sensitivity Reduction attack increased the average ASR from 0.2 to 0.4. These attacks show higher ASR in major LLM tests, further verifying habituation is a fundamental flaw of LLM. Subsequently, this study discusses targeted mitigation strategies for LLM caused by habituation. Finally, future research directions are explored, including evolving new attack methods based on habituation and proposing comprehensive and fundamental defense strategies to enhance the safety and stability of LLM.}

	abstract = {Model extraction (ME) attacks, aiming to steal the functionality or parameters of the victim model, have become a widespread research topic. Most functional ME attack methodologies follow a uniform framework, which we summarize in three steps: initially choosing appropriate attack data, then querying the victim model with this data, and finally, training an incipient clone model based on the victim model’s outputs. Despite much focus on data selection, the latter two steps have been somewhat neglected. Noticing this, we explore a method for the information of attack data labels to enhance the accuracy of the clone model. Specifically, we utilized the incipient clone model to identify similarities between the leaked private data and the attack data, subsequently appending the labels from the leaked data to those of the attack data. Then, we employed these modified attack data labels to fine-tune the incipient clone model, obtaining an enhanced clone model with higher accuracy. The enhancement was applied to three representative ME attack methodologies that primarily focus on the first step. Results show that the enhanced model reveals a higher accuracy than the three basic attacks. In summary, our approach suggests that future research should extend beyond data selection.}

	abstract = {The management of cryptographic keys within cloud services is crucial for ensuring data security but raises significant privacy and trust issues. This paper addresses the vulnerabilities of conventional key management systems (KMS), where cloud service providers might access and control user keys without consent, as well as intercept and misappropriate users’ secret data. To address these concerns, we propose a KMS protocol that leverages trusted hardware to minimize the level of trust required in cloud service providers. Our protocol ensures that the customer master key remains confined within a secure enclave, inaccessible to the service provider, and incorporates a bidirectional authentication mechanism to protect against impersonation by malicious providers. Within the universally composable framework, we design and analyze our protocol and rigorously prove its security. As a result, our designed KMS can be used in composition with any system, and its security can be guaranteed under any conditions. We also develop a prototype KMS based on Intel Trust Domain Extensions and evaluate its performance, emphasizing the system’s viability in real-world applications. The source code for our prototype is publicly available.}

A trusted GPU allocation scheme is an essential part of building a trusted deep learning computing platform. Quantifying the relationship between the number of GPUs allocated and the efficiency of deep learning training tasks helps the platform’s scheduling system provide users with more convincing GPU resource allocation plans, improving task execution efficiency, ensuring fairness among tasks, and reducing and stabilizing energy consumption. However, this topic does not receive significant attention and research. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study by deploying different types of deep learning training tasks on the multi-GPU server to explore the relationship between GPU allocation and task execution efficiency. We summarize the efficiency change patterns of various types of tasks under different GPU allocations. Experiments on various training tasks indicate that models with different parameter sizes exhibit different trends as the number of allocated GPUs increases. This study analyzes these trends and uses function fitting methods to describe the efficiency changes of similar tasks.}

	abstract = {The transformer has profoundly driven the development of natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, their widespread deployment has raised concerns about the potential leakage of data privacy. To address the issue, homomorphic encryption (HE) is employed as a secure technique to process user private inputs over ciphertexts. As HE only supports linear operations, non-linear functions are required to be approximated into polynomials, which leads to heavy communication and computation overhead. In this paper, we propose THEF (Tee-And-HE-based Framework), an efficient and secure inference framework for transformer inference, which uses HE to ensure data security and leverages Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to reduce communication and computation cost. We also design a number of optimization methods, including expanding encoding matrix multiplication scheme, batch acceleration and adaptive scheme, to improve performances of the THEF. Finally, we compare the performances of THEF and the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that THEF maintains a level of accuracy close to that of plaintext model, reduces end-to-end communication cost by 80% and achieves significant improvement in end-to-end run-time.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has significantly advanced the field of phishing defense, but most methods are typically effective only against specific types of attacks, such as phishing emails. Additionally, the large and complex nature of these models often makes them difficult to integrate efficiently into devices. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline for Detecting Multiple Phishing Attacks (DMPA) that combines fine-tuning of a pretrained model with adversarial training. We first apply a unique fine-tuning strategy to optimize resource usage, and then employ adversarial training across multiple types of phishing text attacks. By introducing perturbations to the model’s embedding vectors, we generate a large number of adversarial examples to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our model. We constructed a dataset of 100K high-quality samples and compared our method against the latest approaches from various aspects. The results show that our method surpasses all existing state-of-the-art models in overall performance. Ablation experiments further demonstrate that adversarial training significantly improves the model’s performance, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we have packaged the trained model into a complete pipeline, making it easier to integrate into devices.

	abstract = {Physical attacks are gaining recognition as essential tools for evaluating the security of AI systems in real-world applications. To implement these attacks, adversarial camouflage is meticulously crafted to envelop the entire surface of the target object. Existing attack methods either rely on fixed-view datasets to apply camouflage to specific surfaces of the target or require a complete 3D model of the target to achieve full coverage. However, the former approach limits the effectiveness of the camouflage across multiple viewpoints, while the latter creates a strong dependency between the camouflage and the target’s surface, making it difficult to generate easily applicable, image-like camouflage patterns.To generate reproducible and effective camouflage, we segment the target into a grid and select regions based on the detection model’s attribution map for the current image. Camouflage is then randomly applied to these grid sections, ensuring that any part effectively obscures various structures of the target. To enhance effectiveness in the physical domain and within the environment, we performed a primary color analysis of the background to identify representative environmental colors, constraining the color space of the camouflage to match these colors and improving its transparency and blending capability. By combining these perturbations, we developed a viewpoint-independent camouflage. Extensive testing on the VisDrone and DAS datasets demonstrates that our method achieves the highest attack success rates (ASR), with a maximum detection ASR of 66.91% on the VisDrone dataset, and a maximum detection ASR of 80.16% on the DAS dataset. We achieved a maximum ASR of 79.47% in the physical domain as well.}

	abstract = {During the deployment and utilization of federated models, they are susceptible to unauthorized theft or misuse. To address this issue, researchers have proposed the use of watermarking techniques to protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of the federated models. Nevertheless, traditional watermarking methods in federated learning have certain limitations. It is highly likely that different clients may embed watermarks in the same region of the model. During the aggregation of the watermarked weights, the watermarks from various clients may overlap, resulting in conflicts between the embedded watermarks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called Non-Interfering Fragmented Watermarking for Federated Models (FedNIFW). In the proposed scheme, each client node is assigned a specific segment of the neural network layer where watermarking can be applied. During training, each client is allowed to embed watermarks only within their designated segments, while other segments intended for watermarking by different clients are frozen. Experimental results demonstrate that this segmented watermarking scheme effectively prevents conflicts between client watermarks and does not significantly impact the accuracy of the federated models. These findings underscore the feasibility of the proposed watermarking scheme.}

These methods have difficulty in finding the global optimal solution among various, feasible possibilities of minor changes. Consequently, developing textual adversarial attacks that can produce high-quality adversarial examples continues to be a challenging endeavor. This paper proposes Hamiltonian text adversarial attack (HTAA); primarily, it generates a certain number of adversarial candidates with the guidance of limiting perturbations and gradient projections, expanding the searching scope. Besides, it utilises Hamiltonian simulation to efficiently select the final adversarial example that is closer to the global optimum among the candidates. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method improves semantic similarity and fluency, raising by 5% and 12.3% an average respectively; at the same time, it maintains a high successfully attack rate of more than 90% on four different datasets against the target model.}

	abstract = {Speaker anonymization, a user-centric solution for voice privacy, aims to conceal the speaker’s identity while maintaining clarity and naturalness. The prevalent approach involves cascading modules of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) models for speaker anonymization through speech synthesis. However, the inherent multimodal cascade nature of this approach leads to high error rates and unclear speech due to inaccuracies propagated from the ASR system to the TTS system. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end method for achieving zero-shot speaker anonymization. This method improves the shortcomings of traditional speech models that use a large number of fixed convolution kernels to capture the internal dependencies of speech sequences. It captures the internal dependencies of speech from both long-time and long-distance perspectives by combining a network with variable kernels, namely location-variable convolutions (LVCs), with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and dynamically adjusting weights. Besides, it learns anonymized speaker features flexibly through an enhanced cycle-consistency loss, iteratively aligning speaker information for restructured speech with that of anonymized speakers indefinitely. The efficacy of our proposed speaker anonymization model was demonstrated on the English dataset VCTK.}

	abstract = {In the field of network security, anomaly traffic detection is a key technology for identifying network attacks. It detects abnormal behavior and counteracts it by monitoring changes in traffic patterns. Deep learning-based methods significantly improve detection performance due to their ability to efficiently learn and extract complex feature representations. However, these methods require large amounts of data for training, which exacerbates the risk of privacy breaches and increases training time consumption. This paper proposes an anomaly traffic detection method based on differential privacy and temporal convolutional networks, named DUDPA-TATD. DUDPA-TATD consists of two components: the Dynamic Update Strategy with Differential Privacy Protection Laplace Mechanism (DUDPA) and the Temporal Aggregation Traffic Detection network based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TATD). DUDPA gradually adjusts the privacy protection strategy according to the inference rules of TATD, while TATD enhances the learning of macro and micro differences in time-series data by aggregating key features, further improving detection performance. We conducted experiments on two public datasets. Compared with baseline methods, extensive experiments on the DAPT2020 and SMAP datasets demonstrate that our DUDPA-TATD not only exhibits superior detection performance but also requires less average training time than most baseline methods, qualifying it as a lightweight detection model.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private training data. However, FL is threatened by the model poisoning attacks. Most existing defense methods rely on a clean validation dataset on the server to identify attacks, which contradicts the privacy-preserving principle of FL. Furthermore, defending against a substantial proportion of malicious clients remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes CT-BRFL, a Byzantine-robust FL framework where clients guide trust. Experiments show that even one benign client can effectively guide trust. The server starts with an initial trusted set of benign clients and iteratively selects new trusted clients based on guidance from existing ones. At the same time, it detects and removes potential malicious clients to maintain reliability. Trusted clients update the global model using a robust aggregation rule. Extensive experiments are conducted with five aggregation rules under six model poisoning attacks on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that on MNIST, CT-BRFL can achieve a detection accuracy of 100% even with more than 50% Byzantine clients, while improving model accuracy by up to 25%.}

Abstraction methods can help extract critical features for learning, thereby reducing the disturbance caused by insignificant information. In this paper, we propose a pixelation-based abstraction method to enhance the empirical robustness of DNNs. The method partitions image pixels into superpixels and assigns each an appropriate colour from a continuously updated palette. Two hyperparameters control the abstraction level, allowing for resolution adjustment. Training and evaluation are conducted on pixelated datasets. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and loss landscape analysis demonstrate that our method (i) reduces attack success rates by up to 26.37% while maintaining high accuracy; (ii) exhibits a significant defense against diverse attack methods; and (iii) achieves smoother loss landscapes, underscoring its potential to enhance model robustness.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their individual data, thereby protecting local data privacy. However, attackers, such as untrusted servers, can still compromise the privacy of clients’ local training data through various inference attacks. One feasible approach to protect client privacy during training is the incorporation of differential privacy. Nevertheless, achieving an ideal level of privacy protection with differential privacy often degrades the model’s performance, significantly reducing its accuracy. To enhance model accuracy while minimizing the additional client heterogeneity introduced by differential privacy, this paper proposes a method that integrates personalized layers and data transformations, FusTP-FL. The core of our FusTP-FL is the incorporation of personalized layers and personalized data transformations within the client’s local training model, which further reduces client heterogeneity and improves model accuracy. We evaluated the model’s accuracy on six common datasets; experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FusTP-FL effectively enhances model accuracy across two different differential privacy modes (CDP and LDP), increasing it by up to 45%. Furthermore, we show that compared to PRIVATEFL, our method achieves lower client heterogeneity.}

In this work, we introduce a novel method, ScenLaBe, which leverages large language models (LLMs) and behaviour trees to generate test scenarios from these natural language descriptions. Using the NHTSA’s Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) dataset, experiments show that our approach effectively generates critical test scenarios with high behaviour coverage.}

	abstract = {Neural networks are vulnerable to meticulously crafted adversarial examples, resulting in high-confidence misclassifications in image classification tasks. Due to their stealthiness and difficulty in detection, black-box transfer attacks have become a significant focus of defense. In this article, we propose a purification defense based on probabilistic scheduling algorithm of pre-trained models (ProbSched-PTM) to counter diverse transfer attacks. We first quantify the differences among various models based on their output scores and verify the linear negative correlation between adversarial transferability and model difference. Subsequently, guided by the model difference probability, we integrate the negative momentum probability as a regularization factor to construct ProbSched-PTM. It selects the most appropriate substitute model from multiple pre-trained models to generate strong-transferability adversarial examples for training the purification model, which enables the purification model to effectively eliminate diverse adversarial perturbations. The ProbSched-PTM-based purification defense provides robust defense against unseen adversarial attacks from different substitute models. In a black-box attack scenario, utilizing ResNet-34 as the target model, our approach achieves average defense rates of over 94.8% on CIFAR-10 and over 71.2% on Mini-ImageNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.}

	abstract = {Clustering, as a core technique in data mining, plays a crucial role in uncovering latent patterns in data. Among the many clustering algorithms, Density-Peaks Clustering (DPC) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to efficiently form high-density clusters. Recent research has primarily focused on improving the accuracy and speed of DPC. As concerns about fairness in data science continue to grow, clustering algorithms have gradually started incorporating fairness constraints. Nevertheless, DPC and its variants have remained largely unexplored from the perspective of fairness. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, Individual Fair Density-Peaks Clustering (IFDPC), which enhancing individual fairness by Local Similar Center Graph (LSCG), dynamically assigning rest data based on updating Similar Decision Matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to DPC and its variants, IFDPC not only achieves better fairness but also delivers comparable clustering performance. This work is the first attempt to introduce individual fairness in DPC even in density-based clustering. Code is available on https://github.com/HurryUp1234/IFDPC.}

However, as neural networks deepen, the exponential growth of model parameters leads to increased dimensionality, exacerbating the curse of dimensionality and reducing the effectiveness of traditional distance-based defenses. To address this, we propose Dimensional Disaster-oriented Backdoor Attack Defense in Federated Learning (D2FL), a method that mitigates attacks by focusing on expressive backdoor modules rather than the entire model. This approach reduces dimensionality and mitigates the challenges posed by large parameter spaces. Our extensive evaluation of D2FL on image classification tasks across various deep neural networks demonstrates its superior efficiency, significantly reducing both defense and aggregation times.}

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing testing leverages extensive user participation to identify and fix potential issues in industrial control software, ensuring its security and reliability. Decentralized applications (DApps) can utilize blockchain and smart contract technologies to ensure the decentralization, transparency, and tamper-resistance of industrial control software testing. However, testing efforts conducted via DApps are typically confined to a single blockchain. Coordinating and scheduling DApps deployed on different blockchains has become a critical challenge. Moreover, DApps need to verify the credibility of crowdsourcing participants to ensure the reliability of testing. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes SAMOC, an atomic cross-chain system based on the Atomic-Oracle chain, which aims to realize atomic cross-chain invocations for DApps. SAMOC can realize atomic cross-chain invokes, and the intelligent community deployed on the Atomic-Oracle chain calculates the reputation of users’ accounts across multiple chains through Oracle. This paper also designs a corresponding incentive mechanism to ensure that the auditing of cross-chain invokes is honest and trustworthy. Experimental results show that the cross-chain invokes of the proposed SAMOC scheme have lower latency compared to AtomCI.}

Since the success of storage depends on many complex factors, and there are many cold storage devices in the archiving system, the managers can not quickly locate the abnormal problem information, and in the long run, there are many inconveniences in the abnormal management of the devices. Therefore, this research will study the trustworthiness of cold storage behavior in judicial depository scenarios. This paper mainly focuses on the description of the trustworthiness of cold storage behavior and the collection of data related to behavioral trustworthiness, and the trustworthiness assessment of cold storage behavior will be carried out at a later stage. In this paper, a new trusted attribute classification method is proposed to analyze the trusted attributes for the observer, operation ontology and operation object of deeds. In addition, the cold storage logs are obtained based on the operations of constructing trusted behavior declarations and simulating the operating environment, and the logs are analyzed according to the Drain3 algorithm to extract the real behavioral data of cold storage, which provides theoretical and data support for the next step of cold storage behavioral trustworthiness metrics.}

	abstract = {Recently, the majority of deep learning-based robust watermarking techniques exhibit proficiency in concealing secret information, thereby providing effective protection for the copyright information of images. However, during the digital transmission process, images typically undergo JPEG compression, which significantly compromises the integrity of the watermarks. We found that most current methodologies are inadequately equipped to mitigate the adverse impacts of JPEG compression. In this work, we proposed a robust watermarking method against JPEG compression by applying Frequency Channel Attention and Distortion De-gradient mechanism (FCADD). Specifically, we introduce a only forward propagation mechanism in the attack simulation layer that bypasses the difference caused by image processing, such as compression, dropout, during transmission, allowing a portion of the loss function’s gradient to be passed back to the encoder. Additionally, for the sake of model stability and generalizability, we assign a certain probability to both the JPEG simulation function and a lossless function in different training batches to participate in the training process. Furthermore, we introduce Frequency Channel Attention Blocks (FCA Block) in the feature extraction process, leveraging the information on the image frequency domain to achieve better visual effects. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in JPEG compression across any quality factor, and also exhibits superior visual effects and robustness against other distortions such as Gaussian filtering and Dropout.}

	abstract = {Model checking is a formal method used to verify the correctness of hardware or software system designs and implementations. This kind of algorithm typically involves exhaustively searching the system’s state space to determine if the property is satisfied. Colored Petri Nets (CPN) is a graphical language for building system models and analyzing their properties, which can accurately describe concurrent behavior in software and is suitable for describing complex concurrent systems. At present, some studies extend Computational Tree Logic (CTL) on CPN, but Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) does not, and there are still shortcomings in transition property verification. LTL needs to be combined with the state information and transition firing information of CPN to achieve the model compatible property description. Therefore, this paper proposes an ASK-LTL model detector: ASK-LTL temporal logic is proposed, which is an extension of LTL, and can consider both state information and transition information. The model checking algorithm is proposed. First, simplify the ASK-LTL formula and convert it into a ASK-LTL Büchi automaton (ALGBA). Second, perform calculations using the automaton and CPN state space to generate a product automaton. Third, look for complete paths in the product automaton. This method not only retains the characteristics of LTL, but also can detect the transition information in CPN model. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the method are verified by the experiment of vending machine.}

	abstract = {The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the transportation network has positioned their battery packs not only as power sources for mobility but also as crucial components of energy storage. This dual role enables EVs to trade energy with the grid and among themselves, introducing an innovative approach to energy transactions. Their ability to mitigate peak energy demand and engage in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) exchanges represents a significant step toward a more interactive and adaptable energy infrastructure. This paper introduces a blockchain-based V2V energy trading system that utilizes EVs as mobile energy storage units to effectively promote the trustworthiness of energy trading in an environment of mutual distrust through decentralized protocols. The system includes a V2V energy trading protocol that facilitates secure energy transactions, guarantees data integrity, and builds trust among participants. Additionally, it employs a new group fairness-based trade matching algorithm for sustainable energy trading services, encouraging greater participation from EV owners and fostering a more responsive energy market. To support these decentralized and trusted V2V trading services, an efficient and scalable blockchain prototype is proposed. This prototype features a novel sharding consensus scheme, which has been implemented and deployed for real-world experiments and performance evaluation. This system contributes to the green energy economy by enabling a transparent and trust-based approach to energy trading, offering a transformative model for sustainable energy commerce.}

	abstract = {Traditional abnormal network traffic detection methods only consider statistical features and ignore structural relationships, which makes them difficult to detect advanced attacks. In this paper, we propose DyGCN(Dynamic Graph Convolution Network) for anomaly network traffic detection. Firstly, we represent the network at a given time with a graph using hosts as nodes and construct a graph stream according to the dynamic network. We propose a dynamic graph model with structural learning and temporal learning for hosts. Secondly, we put forward a normal traffic pattern-based contrastive learning method by analyzing the structural characteristics of normal traffic. Thirdly, we obtain the graph representation with edge anomaly probability-based graph embedding method to mine the anomalous substructures in the graph. Finally, we use an anomaly detection model to judge the anomaly of the current network. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that DyGCN outperforms traditional anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art dynamic graph embedding methods.}

	abstract = {Multipath TCP leverages parallel data transmission across multiple paths to improve transmission rates, reliability, and resource utilization. However, Multipath TCP faces severe network security and communication reliability challenges when exposed to low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a robustness optimization security scheme against cascading failures in Multipath TCP (ROSE + ) to tackle the challenges posed by Low-rate Distributed Denial of Service (LDDoS) attacks on network security and communication reliability. The scheme integrates the intricate network load-capacity cascading failures model and leverages the unique characteristics of multipath TCP to facilitate the redistribution of load traffic at ineffectiveness nodes, thereby alleviating the cascading failures induced by LDDoS attack streams. Additionally, we optimize the robustness of communication transmission systems by devising a load-capacity cascading failures model. The experimental results demonstrate that the scheme reduces the probability of cascading failures by 20.07%. This research provides new ideas and methods to improve the robustness and destruction resistance of multipath TCP transmission.}

These systems rely heavily on large datasets to train machine learning models capable of detecting patterns and predicting threats. In the past two decades, researchers have produced a multitude of datasets, however, some widely utilised recent datasets generated with CICFlowMeter contain inaccuracies. These result in flow generation and feature extraction inconsistencies, leading to skewed results and reduced system effectiveness. Other tools in this context lack ease of use, customizable feature sets, and flow labelling options. In this work, we introduce HERA, a new open-source tool that generates flow files and labelled or unlabelled datasets with user-defined features.

In addition, the combination of artificial noise (AN) and decode-and-forward (DF) technology is applied at the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay. We then derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP), which is affected by power allocation factors, to measure the system secrecy performance. Finally, a machine learning (ML) power allocation optimization algorithm is proposed considering both network security and user fairness. To be specific, we employ a revised decision tree (DT) embedded multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the leaf nodes, aiming to utilize the strengths of both ML algorithms effectively and find the optimal groups of systems with various parameters rapidly. The data results demonstrate that the introduced algorithm provides satisfactory predictions and obtains more accurate coefficients compared to other ML algorithms.}

	abstract = {The rapid increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and data across various domains (e.g., healthcare, smart cities, smart factories, and smart homes) has led to growing complexity in managing security policies to protect them. Moreover, the increased complexity makes it even more challenging to define security policies in the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model, which requires considering user requirements and environmental conditions. Thus, the ABAC model is likely to include unexpected uncertainties when administrators define security policies. In this study, uncertainty refers to unforeseen future outcomes that may arise from factors the administrator has not considered. Furthermore, the increasing number of IoT devices makes it nearly impossible for administrators to predict all uncertainties and adjust security policies accordingly. Several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, but they rely on human intervention. Therefore, this study proposes a self-adaptive framework that combines a self-adaptive system with deep neural networks (DNNs) to respond to uncertainties intelligently and autonomously. The framework effectively identifies uncertainties in the access control process through variational autoencoder (VAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM) without human intervention and autonomously responds using a self-adaptive system.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of cloud-native architectures, data centers are increasingly facing severe security challenges, particularly in defending against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The complex interdependencies between microservices allow the impact of a DDoS attack to spread rapidly, significantly degrading overall server performance. Traditional DDoS defense strategies often struggle to effectively counter attacks within data centers, particularly those targeting east-west traffic. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fast and efficient DDoS detection and mitigation mechanism specifically tailored for data center environments using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and eXpress Data Path (XDP) technologies. By leveraging eBPF, we achieve kernel-level, nonintrusive data collection while maintaining flow state tracking, thereby reducing communication overhead. Additionally, we trained an XGBoost classification model to create DDoS traffic filtering rules specifically designed for data center scenarios. Combined with XDP technology, we implemented low-latency malicious traffic detection at the entry point of the network protocol stack, allowing for the immediate filtering of attack traffic and thereby mitigating the impact of DDoS attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional tools, our approach not only achieves high accuracy but also significantly enhances system performance.}

	abstract = {Cyberattacks on digital services and Internet of Things (IoT) are rising, employing complex tactics. Using intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and counter threats at key network points is vital for strong cybersecurity. Traditional rule-based network IDS rely on predefined rules, which may not effectively recognize the myriad complex variants of potential attacks. AI-driven methods for detecting malicious traffic offer enhanced capabilities but can fall short in terms of interpretability and performance under high-throughput network conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-based (Large Language Model) agent that utilizes multiple sources inputs to generate and generalize rules. The generated rules are designed to detect a variety of corresponding malicious threats, while the generalized rules are crafted to identify similar variant attacks. We have amassed an extensive dataset, comprising vulnerability security reports, malicious traffic, and original IDS rules from authoritative sources, which serve as input for the LLM-based agent. Subsequently, comparative experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the new rules in detecting malicious traffic. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of these new rules across various metrics for malicious traffic detection.}

	abstract = {In scenarios involving a single targeted application service, it is essential to monitor the security of business-oriented processes. However, there is currently a lack of lightweight, real-time online anomaly detection methods for targeted processes that do not require labeled data. This paper presents a self-supervised anomaly detection model for targeted processes, based on a minimal observation event set and utilizing eBPF and deep learning techniques. The model first selects a minimal set of observed events for the targeted process, which includes critical system calls, process scheduling, resource usage, and I/O operations. Unlike traditional system call sequence features, this model focuses on the rate of change in the frequency of feature selection calls. The detection model employs the VAE-LSTM algorithm, where the VAE module constructs robust short windows and the LSTM module estimates long-term correlations within the sequence. Through self-supervised learning, the model learns the normal behavior of targeted processes, extracts robust behavioral features, and reduces feature dimensions. By performing online detection of these learned features against runtime processes, the model achieves second-level anomaly detection for targeted processes. Finally, by simulating and constructing eight different types of process attack scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy exceeding 92%, with a performance overhead of less than 10%.}

	abstract = {Current grey-box protocol fuzzers may not work well with poor-quality initial seeds. That makes it difficult to cover diverse message types and protocol states defined in the protocol specification. To mitigate this issue, we propose GeMuFuzz, which integrates deep learning based seed generation into mutation-based grey-box fuzzing. Moreover, GeMuFuzz considers the high-dimensional information implied in seeds generated during fuzzing. We also evaluated the performance of GeMuFuzz by comparing with the baseline fuzzer AFLNET on 8 typical protocol implementations of ProFuzzBench. GeMuFuzz discovered 5.07% more paths and 6.19% more crashes, as well as 8.57% more states and 10.54% more state transitions than AFLNET. The experimental results highlight that GeMuFuzz could improve the effectiveness of fuzzing.}

	abstract = {Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities continue to pose a formidable challenge in the realm of web application security due to their prevalence. Despite the development of various defense mechanisms, including input validation techniques and code differentiation strategies, these solutions have struggled to achieve broad adoption in real-world environments due to persistent issues such as unreliable detection, high computational overhead, scalability limitations, and compatibility concerns. This paper introduces a novel managed proxy-based framework for XSS defense, positioned strategically between the web browser and the web server. This framework employs a tag-based XSS protection mechanism alongside a defense-in-depth strategy, providing robust protection not only against XSS attacks but also against other web threats. Furthermore, the framework integrates advanced web front-end hardening techniques to significantly complicate the exploitation of potential vulnerabilities. Comprehensive practical evaluations indicate that the proposed framework is both flexible and effective, demonstrating outstanding performance across multiple dimensions.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of IoT devices, their inadequate security measures make them increasingly susceptible to malicious attacks. Consequently, accurate device identification has become a critical task for safeguarding network security and privacy. This paper introduces IFPH, a novel method for IoT device fingerprinting and identification based on periodic traffic payload hashing. By exploiting the inherent periodicity in idle traffic, IFPH uses Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract the traffic's periodicity and applies Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to process packet payloads within each period. This method generates distinctive device fingerprints, facilitating efficient and reliable device identification. Unlike previous methods, IFPH addresses the inaccuracies associated with fixed-time window fingerprinting and eliminates the need for complex feature extraction or model training. Experimental results reveal that IFPH surpasses existing techniques, achieving accuracy and recall rates exceeding 95% on publicly available datasets.}

	abstract = {Hacker communities on various platforms have similar interests in sharing malware, vulnerability knowledge, and other illegal artifacts. Therefore, it is helpful to identify hacker communities to detect potential security issues. Many researchers have concentrated on detecting hacker communities on online social networks, such as Twitter and underground forums. However, the problem of detecting hacker communities in chat groups remains unresolved. To address two main challenges in detecting hacker communities in chat groups, this paper presented a method named Self-optimizing Graph Clustering based on Multitask Learning (SGCML). On the one hand, differing from traditional social networks, there are no direct edge relationships between users in chat groups, thereby this paper defines meta-paths as edges to reveal how hackers are connected. On the other hand, this paper presents a self-optimizing graph clustering method based on multi-task learning to address the issue of labeled data scarcity. According to the experiments, SGCML outperforms baselines to a great extent and can correctly identify significant nodes and structures in the hacker community, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting hacker communities on chat groups.}

	abstract = {Source code vulnerability detection is of great significance in securing software as well as addressing novel threats, and neural network-based methods have made significant progress in the field of vulnerability detection. However, the widely used neural network-based vulnerability detection methods suffer from the loss of complex structural and semantic information in the source code. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a dual-attention composite pooling-based vulnerability detection method called DA-CPVD for source code, it enhances the feature representation through fully considering the overall contextual information and complex dependencies of source code. The key of DA-CPVD is the use of a dual-attention composite pooling approach to emphasizes the key features more flexibly, thereby forming a comprehensive pooled feature representation. In specific, DA-CPVD utilizes a self-attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weights to features, as well as uses a composite pooling based on attention mechanism aggregation to dynamically adjust the weights of pooling results. The DA-CPVD method is evaluated on three publicly available and widely used datasets, and the experimental result shows that DA-CPVD improves Accuracy, Precision and F1-measure by an average of 11.52%, 28.7%, and 10.45%, and reduces False Positive Rate by an average of 19.15% compared to other existing methods.}

	abstract = {While using generative models to create synthetic network traffic is faster and cheaper than traditional testbeds, synthetic traffic suffers from problems with realism and structural completeness. State of the art traffic generation frameworks usually omit payloads because of the difficulties in representing their high-dimensional data, which makes the synthetic traffic unrealistic and limits its usefulness. This work proposes a two-stage process that takes advantage of the high repetition of some protocols, particularly those used by Industrial Control Systems, to selectively simplify payloads, greatly reducing the number of classes and reducing model loss and consequently the ability of the model to handle sequences of payloads. Model training loss was reduced by 47.796%, and payload class selection was improved up to 69% over state of the art approaches, allowing for more realistic synthetic network traffic with reduced memory and computation overheads.}

However, developers of both super apps and mini-apps typically focus on functionality, thus overlooking security measures essential for protecting users’ sensitive information and safeguarding critical operations. In this paper, we utilize a static analysis approach, revealing two major security flaws of mini-apps and super apps: users’ sensitive information leakage and caller impersonation attacks. We analyzed 10,000 popular mini-apps on WeChat and found that 2,554 are vulnerable to the users’ sensitive information leakage. For the caller impersonation attack, we found one example that is vulnerable to such an attack.}

	abstract = {With the growing number of software developments and the expansion of functionalities, more and more developers tend to use third-party packages to speed up development and improve efficiency. Due to the openness of npm and the widespread use of Node.js, npm has become the largest open source software ecosystem and therefore a prime target for malicious attackers. Attackers often use various attack vectors to release new malicious packages or destroy existing benign packages, thus posing threats to software that rely on these packages. Therefore, detecting malicious npm packages is of great significance for protecting user security and building a more reliable and secure npm open source software ecosystem.We propose Maldet, an automated malicious npm package detection method. Maldet uses the malicious behavior pattern library we have built as features, training known malicious and benign samples with four different classifiers. In addition, we use a supplementary detector to perform a secondary detect on packages that detected benign, thereby reducing the number of false negatives. The results show that Maldet can detect each package in an average of just a few seconds with 97.12% accuracy, which is superior to other tools, providing high accuracy and fast classification capability.}

	abstract = {Since primary nodes play a critical leadership role in PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus algorithm, it is mandatory to perform an update process for eliminating the malicious primary nodes so as to maintain the security level of PBFT. As it is convenient to calculate node reputations, most of existing updating schemes select the node with the highest reputation as the primary node in every consensus round. However, the round-by-round reputation update mechanism inevitably increases the communication overhead and consensus latency. To reduce the number of update times, we propose an algorithm based on an adaptive reputation mechanism, named Commit Block PBFT or CBPBFT for short. In this mechanism, a node’s reputation is determined by the number of its committed blocks during the most recent period as a primary node. As the reputation update adaptively occurs according to the number of blocks committed by the primary node, the mechanism significantly decreases the frequency of reputation updates, and hence increases the consensus performance. Experimental results show that, CBPBFT reduces the probability of a Byzantine node gaining leadership by 15% and decreases communication latency by 15% to 32% in comparison with the state-of-the art.}

Efficiently supporting secure and dynamic data updates in complex graphs, while ensuring the security of the newly generated ciphertexts during the key being compromised and the time when the new key is updated, is a critical challenge. In this paper, we proposed a novel dynamic encrypted property graph search scheme named Rabbit. To the best of our knowledge, Rabbit is the first cryptographic privacy-preserving graph search scheme that supports efficient multi-attribute conjunctive querying and data updates in complex graphs, with post-compromise security provided during key updates. In addition, Rabbit achieves sub-linear search efficiency, with the time complexity for both attribute-grained updates and node-grained deletions being  O ( 1 ) \\mathcal{O}(1) . Moreover, Rabbit employs a robust two-layer encryption mechanism, ensuring that even if the client’s key is compromised, the integrity and security of the newly generated ciphertexts remain unaffected.}

These techniques can effectively predict and identify potential malicious activities through precise analysis of network behavior data, thereby providing essential protection for information systems. Noting the limitations of existing malware traffic classification methods in extracting sequence features and the insufficiencies of statistical features in capturing the full spectrum of traffic behaviors, we introduces an innovative approach. Our study maps network communication traffic onto a graph-based structure, leveraging the properties of graphs to uncover behavioral differences among various types of malware. By conducting a detailed analysis of the spatial attributes of nodes and edges within the graph, combined with sequence information, we propose a classification method for malware traffic based on multidimensional features. Furthermore, we have compiled multiple datasets from diverse environments and performed a series of experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of malware classification.}

	abstract = {The existing anomaly detection methods for IoT devices suffer from several limitations, including inadequate and untimely implementation of security control measures, as well as an inability to promptly mitigate intrusion behaviors. To address these issues, we propose an anomaly detection model for IoT devices based on behavioral feature analysis (ADIoT). The model implements two methods, specifically multidimensional behavior feature selection and anomaly detection. The first method uses the principal component analysis based on weighted contribution(WCPCA) to identify the most representative feature combination from a large number of features and generate a feature dataset that accurately reflects the device behavior patterns. The second method uses an anomaly detection method based on isolation forests to score and identify anomalies in behavioral data and dynamically adjust the anomaly detection threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that ADIoT achieves a detection accuracy of 98.6% on the TON dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection models. Additionally, ADIoT significantly improves time efficiency, reducing test times by 30.79% compared to SVM-based models and by 20.11% compared to CNN-based models.}

	abstract = {To investigate side-channel vulnerabilities in the microarchitecture of multicore processors and develop effective protection strategies, we analyze the primitives of the transient attack known as Meltdown. Our study reveals that the relative window of the exception handler significantly impacts the attack's effectiveness. Focusing on the Intel Skylake architecture, we conduct a comparative analysis between the memory order buffer (MOB), which regulates the execution order of load and store instructions, and the multi-level cache, which enhances data access efficiency. Our findings indicate that threads sharing resources within the core can exploit load instructions to directly access data stored by other users in the store buffer. Additionally, the data reside in cache, influenced by the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy, is particularly vulnerable to data leakage through side-channel attacks. By leveraging transient data from the store buffer and cache, the relative window of the exception handler can be expanded, we demonstrate that incorporating Meltdown can facilitate a transient attack that successfully retrieves the complete communication key of OpenSSH AES.}

	abstract = {In social media, coordinated groups spread false information and guide public opinion through organized social behaviors. Coordination detection methods based on behavioral sequences identify coordinated groups among users by extracting temporal and structural data. However, existing methods generally concentrate on identification and analysis from an individual perspective, lacking evaluation and detection from a group perspective to measure the degree of coordination, which results in low accuracy of detection results. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised evaluation method of Relative Coordination Degree of Groups (RCDG). This method models the global time and differentiated network features from group perspective using Neural Time Point Process (NTPP) and Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), and evaluates the relative degree of coordination based on the fused features. Experimental results show that RCDG can effectively evaluate the relative degree of coordination among groups. Furthermore, it can achieve an accuracy rate of up to 99.8% in detecting coordinated groups.}

	abstract = {Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has been chosen to replace the traditional access control model due to its dynamics, flexibility and scalability recently. However, during the migration and deployment process of ABAC policies, the key issue is how to mine accurate access control policies and quickly evaluate the policies when an access request arrives. Previous approaches typically addressed these two aspects separately, and the emergence of integrated solutions has provided new insights for addressing this issue. However, despite the high accuracy of the integrated solution in policy evaluation, it still falls short in terms of interpretability and performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision tree based ABAC policy mining and policy evaluation (DTAME) scheme, which employs different policy mining and evaluation algorithms based on various datasets. For access control lists, we utilize decision tree algorithms to mine ABAC policies and conduct policy evaluations based on policy trees. For access control logs, we adopt a decision tree to achieve performance approximating that of XGBoost. Experimental results show that the scheme offers superior interpretability and policy evaluation performance at the expense of a certain degree of accuracy.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of information technology, the rapid increase in software systems has led to a growing demand for research on vulnerability detection. In recent years, the fast-paced development of deep learning has introduced new approaches and directions for this field. Existing source code vulnerability detection methods often fail to explicitly preserve the semantic information related to vulnerabilities in the source code, leading to difficulties in extracting vulnerable code features and high false-positive rates in detection. To address these issues, this study proposes a vulnerability detection method for intermediate code based on a relational dependency graph (RDG). After converting the source code into an intermediate representation, it is mapped to an RDG, which accurately expresses the data and control flow dependencies within the program. This approach retains critical node features and refines the types of control flow and data flow edges. By leveraging this method, it becomes possible to trace program data and control dependencies, understand data flow directions, and analyze interactions between different parts of the program, enabling the precise identification and interpretation of potential security vulnerabilities. Drawing on concepts from code property graphs (CPG), this method enhances the understanding and capture of complex relationships between nodes in graph-structured data. By performing vulnerability detection on intermediate code, this approach avoids false positives and negatives caused by language or platform-specific differences, thereby enabling deeper identification and interpretation of complex vulnerability patterns in source code. Experimental results on the SARD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a high precision rate of 98.7% for detecting command injection vulnerabilities (CWE78), significantly outperforming traditional methods.}

	abstract = {As traditional automobiles evolve into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the increasingly frequent interactions between intelligent vehicles and external environments make cybersecurity a critical issue. While existing machine learning-based automotive intrusion detection methods demonstrate strong detection performance, most rely on supervised learning frameworks. These approaches not only incur high manual data labeling costs but also show significant limitations when handling real-world, unlabeled attack samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient intrusion detection system for in-vehicle networks based on self-supervised contrastive learning. By leveraging data augmentation, we construct positive sample pairs and learn robust feature representations through joint training using both reconstruction loss and contrastive loss. Additionally, we fuse the features extracted from the backbone and core networks into global representations for downstream classification tasks. Experiments on real in-vehicle intrusion datasets show that SSC-IDS achieves strong performance in anomaly detection. Furthermore, we test the model’s robustness under varying rates of anomaly contamination.}

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for insider threat detection, where we leverage advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the detection of abnormal user activities indicative of insider threats. We represent user behaviors in a vector space using Word2Vec, which in turn are analyzed using state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, SciBERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and LLaMA. These models are integrated with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to analyze the temporal behavior of user actions. We evaluate the proposed method using the CMU-CERT dataset version 4.2. Our implemented approaches based on NLP achieve better results than previous state-of-the-art approaches that use traditional unsupervised learning.}

	abstract = {In vehicular networks, securing the network relies on analyzing extensive vehicle perception data to create an accurate road information model. Effective data sharing is crucial for this objective. However, traditional centralized data sharing methods jeopardize the privacy and security of data providers. Federated Learning has emerged as a solution to this challenge. Unfortunately, conventional Federated Learning strategies often overlook the differences in resource investments and data quality among participating vehicles, leading to unfair model distribution and diminishing the willingness of vehicles to share data. This paper proposes a two-stage Federated Learning strategy. In the first phase, aggregation nodes employ a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to assess the training results of participating vehicles and allocate aggregation weights accordingly. In the second phase, aggregation nodes calculate vehicle reputations using a periodic averaging method and distribute a differentially compressed global model based on these reputation values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves performance comparable to existing Federated Learning algorithms while effectively calculating vehicle reputations, ensuring fair distribution, and mitigating malicious clients.}

	abstract = {As containerization technology progresses, the network functions within the 5G core are abstracted into Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), operating within a cloud-based ecosystem. To bolster network resilience, autoscaling strategies dynamically allocate resources in response to workloads, ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) is maintained. However, the inherent openness of 5G networks exposes them to signaling storms and unexpected disturbances, leading to substantial workload fluctuations and bursts. Current reactive autoscaling strategies are slow to respond to these challenges, falling short of user expectations for low-latency, high-quality internet services. To address this challenge, we propose a novel auto-scaling framework specifically designed for the 5G cloud core network system, dubbed 5G-PPDE. Our framework harnesses the Crossformer model for accurate workload forecasting and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classification model to offer four distinct scaling strategies. The scaling-down decision algorithm implements a Gradual Decrease Strategy (GDS) for resource management, while the burst scaling strategy adapts to sudden workload changes by referencing the maximum service quantities observed during historical window periods. We have constructed a validation system leveraging the open-source Free5GC and Free5GMANO, using the wrk tool to simulate burst traffic scenarios. Prometheus is utilized for real-time data collection, thereby validating the efficacy of our proposed framework. The findings demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the impact of burst traffic, outperforming current solutions.}

	abstract = {Automated source code vulnerability detection using code graphs has seen major improvements in recent years, however one critical, but oft-overlooked, element of this problem is producing embeddings for graph nodes. Before graph-based classifiers can be used for vulnerability detection, the nodes in the graph must first be given vector representations. Graphlearning models propagate information from these embeddings through the graph before classification, and so the initial states of these embeddings are vital for all subsequent learning. While a variety of solutions to this problem have been proposed in existing literature, this is typically not the focus of these works. We propose a novel node embedding strategy for graph-based vulnerability discovery, which takes advantage of richly-learned information about the code contained in each node. We also implement and test several existing node embedding strategies, comparing them to each other and our new strategy under a standard graph-learning architecture. We find that our strategy outperforms existing methods by 10.47-50.70%.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized computing and data storage by providing flexible resource management and on-demand services. However, the centralized nature of cloud computing results in significant security issues that pose significant threats to cloud services. The security threat can be alleviated to a certain extent through the cloud platform security assessment. However, the existing cloud platform security assessment framework mainly measures security from the enterprise perspective and lacks methods from the user perspective. For users, much information is internal to the enterprise and cannot be obtained. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called CVALLM to measure cloud platform security from the user’s perspective, which uses a large language model to automatically complete a cloud platform security assessment. First, we utilize a large language model to complete cloud platform information extraction and vulnerability collection from SLA agreements and product description documents that the user can access. Second, to solve the vulnerability assessment problem, we propose a vulnerability severity prediction method based on deep learning. This method considers both the textual description characteristics and the source code characteristics of the vulnerability. Finally, we propose an overall security assessment method for the cloud platform based on a large language model, design quantitative indicators to measure the security of the cloud platform, and automatically generate security reports to facilitate users’ ability to quickly compare and choose the right cloud service.}

However, edge data faces challenges in terms of integrity and security. Data owners (Data Owner, DO) should delegate auditors to periodically verify the integrity of the data. However, existing verification methods have not yet addressed issues related to verifiers forging evidence and fair payment. This paper proposes a smart contract-based edge data integrity verification scheme. An audit tree based on lattice hashing is designed, allowing the smart contract to initiate multiple verification challenges while only storing a complete label, thus reducing storage overhead. The homomorphic additivity of lattice hashing supports arbitrary data segmentation as challenges, effectively preventing EN from forging evidence. This scheme also designs two smart contract arbitration algorithms to ensure fair payment. Experimental comparisons show that this scheme effectively resolves the trust issues related to EN and ensures fair payment among EN, CSP, and DO.}

	abstract = {Website Fingerprinting Attack (WFA) is an effective method of network monitoring, which analyzes network traffic to identify the specific website or web page that a user is browsing. The performance of previous WFA, which assume singletab scenarios, deteriorates significantly in real-world multi-tab environments. While this issue has been acknowledged and some research has been conducted on multi-tab WFA, limitations in the accuracy and efficiency of multi-tab classification still persist. Specifically, extended research on mixed-tab scenarios, where the number of tabs is unknown, still lacks sufficient attention. In this paper, we propose FD-WF, a multi-tab WFA model based on fixed dimensions on the Tor network. This model mitigates the issue of blurred features in single-tab images caused by the expansion of multi-tab mixed traffic sequences. It enhances the ability to accurately identify and classify multiple web pages users are browsing. We propose a minimum padding optimization function to improve the performance of fixed-dimension image generation and introduce an enhanced ResNet-18 model to better address the fingerprint classification challenge for multi-tab scenarios. The experimental results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. While ensuring the performance of singletab WFA, our model achieved a F1 Score of 96% for multi-tab web pages. Even in the more complex mixed-tab scenario, we still achieved an F1 Score of 78%.}

	abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU data protection law, requires compliance modeling techniques to help service providers meet its stringent requirements. Traditional privacy modeling techniques often fail to address and mitigate threats of non-compliance. This paper introduces an efficient threat modeling technique based on Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP) to identify and mitigate non-compliance threats. To achieve this, we construct a DeLP-based knowledge base that integrates facts and rules derived from GDPR requirements. We then implement an inference engine to reason about GDPR non-compliance threats upon this knowledge base. Two novel concepts, namely the horizontal complexity and vertical complexity of a DeLP knowledge base, have been defined to further analyze and evaluate the complexity of the proposed DeLP-based modeling mechanism. An empirical demonstration validates the system’s feasibility and confirms the time complexity of the proposed reasoner. The findings demonstrate that the proposed DeLP-based technique provides an effective approach to GDPR compliance modeling and improves legal reasoning.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement and application of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), personal health records (PHRs) are now increasingly comprised of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and medical records documented by healthcare professionals. Personal health record (PHR) sharing demonstrates great potential in improving the accuracy of disease diagnosis. However, PHR sharing also brings risks such as illegal access and personal information leakage. Some works explored using blockchain or attribute-based encryption (ABE) to solve these privacy leakage problems, but those solutions did not pay attention to the user’s attribute privacy. In this work, we combine a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) scheme to design an efficient zero-knowledge proof protocol called zk-AHSNARK. It can verify the user’s attribute permissions while also hiding attribute information. Based on zk-AHSNARK, we propose a novel PHR sharing scheme that protects attribute privacy. Data security is ensured by storing encrypted data in the interplanetary file system (IPFS). In addition, we introduce keyword ciphertext search to achieve fast data retrieval, and we implement the search and verification algorithms via a smart contract, ensuring the trustworthiness and integrity of the execution. Finally, through a large number of simulations, we demonstrated the suggested scheme’s viability and security.}

	abstract = {In contrast to the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) as a pure reflection device in the past, in this letter, from a more micro perspective, we propose to employ pseudo-random constellation rotation to secure microwave quick response (QR) code communication. Specifically, confidential information is encoded into a QR code, which is displayed on an IRS. Pseudo-random constellation rotation is applied to each element of the IRS to encrypt the QR code. This ensures that only the authenticated user (Bob) can decode and access the confidential information, while an eavesdropper (Eve) is unable to correctly interpret the QR code. We derive a closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) and analyze the impact of various factors on the BER for both Bob and Eve, including the distance between Bob and the IRS, Bob’s transmit power, and the Rician factor. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness in achieving secure communication.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely utilized in recommender systems to model higher-order interactions between users and items due to their capacity to handle the intricate relational data. Federated Learning, known for its excellent privacy-preserving capabilities, is extensively applied in recommender systems. Nonetheless, existing GNN-based recommendation methods fail to fully leverage the integration of social networks and knowledge graphs into the recommendation process, neglecting the subtle differences between these data sources. Furthermore, current federated learning-based recommendation frameworks cannot balance efficiency and privacy protection, with adversaries potentially exploiting attacks to breach user privacy. To address these issues, we propose Federated Knowledge-enhanced Graph Attention Network for Social Recommendation (FGAT4SR) to achieve efficient recommendations. Specifically, we use graph attention networks to learn the rich knowledge and aggregate their most critical information. Then pseudo-item interactions and local differential privacy are incorporated into our model to ensure privacy protection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed federated recommendation framework outperforms all baseline methods. Our approach enables the sophisticated integration of social relationships and knowledge graphs while preserving privacy.}

	abstract = {In the domain of federated learning, traditional federated averaging algorithms encounter difficulties in maximizing accuracy in non-IID data circumstances due to the large data volume and the low model efficiency ratio of participants. To address the problem of non-IID data among participants in FL, this paper puts forward a novel greedy aggregation algorithm based on the Fap model evaluation, named FedEGA. FedEGA incorporates models from each participant into the global model successively as potential components and builds the global model by evenly distributing multiple model weights that are fine-tuned with various hyperparameter configurations. During the construction process, a dynamic weight parameter mechanism is adopted to balance the accuracy and precision evaluation of the model. By using validation set scores on the central server, FedEGA ranks models in descending order, ensuring that the global model does not perform worse than the best individual model on the retained validation set, thereby alleviating issues caused by client drift and the hindrance to maximizing accuracy due to non-IID data. Experiments on public datasets and real-world data show that our algorithm surpasses classic FL algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Proximal (FedProx) optimization, and Federated Self-Regularization (FedSR) in terms of maximum accuracy and communication efficiency in non-IID scenarios. Additionally, experiments with imbalanced data confirm its stronger robustness and generalization capabilities.}

	abstract = {Private set intersection (PSI) is an important cryptographic primitive with many real-world applications. Delegating PSI computation to the cloud can effectively reduce management and computational costs of data owners, and therefore has received widespread attention from researchers. However, in the existing delegated PSI schemes, it is hard for the data owner to authorize only a part of its outsourced data, and for users to flexibly select a part of the outsourced encrypted data of the data owner for intersection computation. In this paper, we propose the multi-subset fine-grained authorization PSI (MA-PSI) over outsourced encrypted datasets. Specially, our protocol is designed for the multi-subset case where each subset is associated with one single tag for data classification. Through tag classification and encryption technology, the data owner can perform fine-grained authorization on its subsets. By querying tags, the user can flexibly select any subset of the data owner for intersection computation. The security definition of the MA-PSI protocol is given, and its security is proved in the semi-honest model. Experimental results show that our protocol is very efficient and the computational cost is linear with the size of the subset. Specifically, the intersection algorithm SetI in our MA-PSI is about 80× (the subset size is 2 15 ) - 2500× (the subset size is 2 10 ) faster than APSI (Wang et al., IEEE TIFS 2021).}

	abstract = {The results of federated learning contain certain private information and still have the risk of privacy leakage. Therefore, this paper proposes a Federated Learning Scheme with Adaptive Hierarchical Protection and Multiple Aggregation (ADDFed). The scheme trains models and generates updates using local datasets at the client side. Based on comparisons between client contributions and two thresholds, it chooses homomorphic encryption, adaptive differential privacy, or data discarding methods to protect the data. The first aggregation model and the second aggregation model are obtained by classification aggregation at the server side. Finally, the client decrypts and aggregates to get the global model. Experimental results demonstrate that ADDFed consumes a privacy budget of 3624.47, involves 562,219,358 bytes of communication, and requires 11,603 seconds of training time, achieving a model accuracy of 87.4%, thus showing significant advantages.}

	abstract = {Deep learning is being extensively utilized across various domains, with deep learning-based recommendation systems gaining prominence due to their exceptional performance. However, these systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries introduce carefully crafted fake user ratings to compromise the integrity of the recommendation model. We propose a dual defense to address this threat. The first line of defense, termed active defense, preemptively reduces the system’s vulnerability to poisoning attacks by incorporating crafted regularization into the loss function. This approach diminishes the attacker’s impact while preserving system performance, thereby lowering the success rate of targeted attacks. To further enhance the system’s robustness, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based detection model as a passive defense strategy to accurately identify and filter out poisoned data. Empirical evaluations on three distinct datasets demonstrate that our dual defense approach significantly enhances both the proactive defense and passive detection capabilities of recommendation systems, effectively countering data poisoning attacks.}

Despite its potential, scRNA-seq faces significant challenges related to data privacy, cost, and Intellectual Property (IP) protection, which hinder the sharing and collaborative use of these sensitive datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, scE(match), a privacy-preserving tool that facilitates the matching of single-cell clusters between different datasets by relying on scmap as an established projection tool, but without compromising data privacy or IP. scE(match) utilizes homomorphic encryption to ensure that data and unique cell clusters remain confidential while enabling the identification of overlapping cell types for further collaboration and downstream analysis. Our evaluation shows that scE(match) performantly matches cell types across datasets with high precision, addressing both practical and ethical concerns in sharing scRNA-seq data. This approach not only supports secure data collaboration but also fosters advances in biomedical research by reliably protecting sensitive information and IP rights.}

	abstract = {Ensuring privacy often results in sacrificing the accuracy of iris recognition systems. A primary challenge in contemporary iris biometric privacy methods lies in striking a balance between recognition accuracy and privacy of protected iris templates. Hence, any proposition for privacy-protected iris recognition must prioritize irreversibility, revocability, and unlinkability to uphold robust privacy standards while achieving higher recognition accuracy. This research proposes an approach that stands as a robust solution with acceptable advancement in three challenges: recognition accuracy, privacy protection and computational efficiency. We experimented with an innovative technique that manipulates the columns of an iris template by fusing the bit pattern of the template using the XOR operation. The transformation process is non-linear. This fusion introduces randomness and variability to the fused templates. It also poses enhanced privacy protection. Two datasets were used to validate the proposed approach. Based on the results of dataset 1, the proposed approach accepts genuine users at a rate of 99.11% while it accepts 0.01% of imposters. For dataset 2, the Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) is depicted as 81.12% while FAR is at 0.01%. The proposed approach can be applied in practice due to its higher computational efficiency. As further improvements, the research can be extended to more widespread databases and higher-quality iris samples.}

To address these issues, we propose a conjunctive forward-backward secure dynamic symmetric searchable encryption scheme for smart healthcare called CFB-DSSE. First, we utilize inner product predicate encryption technology to achieve conjunctive queries while preserving user privacy. Second, we employ tailored proxy re-encryption technology to ensure forward and backward security, thereby enhancing smart healthcare system security. Third, we design a double-layer encrypted bitmap index structure to replace the traditional homomorphic encryption technology to encrypt the bitmap index, reducing computational and communication overhead and enabling non-interactive queries. Through experiments and analysis, CFB-DSSE scheme demonstrates considerable advancements in protecting medical data privacy and improving query efficiency. CFB-DSSE can save at least 100ms of search time compared to other related schemes.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the proliferation of data-driven applications has intensified the challenge of balancing data utility with user privacy protection. Existing privacy-preserving query schemes fail to meet the requirements of practical applications due to their limitations in execution efficiency and communication overhead. This paper proposed a novel secure anonymous query protocol to address these limitations. Our approach uniquely combines data partitioning with a modified Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol for query data preprocessing, obliviously reducing the query range and enhancing efficiency. We further integrate additive secret sharing with Garbled Bloom Filters to strengthen query privacy. A thorough security analysis conducted under the semi-honest model has validated the protocol’s effectiveness in protecting client and data privacy. Experimental evaluations show that our protocol execution time is reduced by up to 69% and communication overhead is reduced by 49% for a dataset containing 10 6  records compared to existing methods.}

While existing literature has evaluated individual privacy controls such as cookie consent interfaces, less attention has been given to how combining multiple privacy controls in realistic online environments affects the overall user experience. We conducted an online user study with 75 participants to explore the usability of privacy controls offered by websites across four widely used categories. Participants were asked to interact with website prototypes that differed in terms of where and how the privacy control variants were presented, then answer a survey about their experience. Our findings revealed the usability impact of design parameters on privacy controls and highlighted how user expectations vary across different demographics and website categories. We provide design recommendations that combine informative elements (privacy notices and policies) with actionable elements (privacy nudges and settings) to enhance the usability of website privacy controls for users.}

Current research in data hiding focuses on enhancing the covert nature of the embedded secret data and the embedding capacity of the carrier. This article presents a high-capacity and high-security data hiding scheme in encrypted Images based on image filtering and blocking (IFIB-DHEI). Our contributions are as follows: (1) Improves the predictor used in the data hiding process to make it more accurate in predicting pixel points. (2) Using Gaussian filters for preprocessing to improve the smoothness of carrier images greatly increases the embedding capacity of carrier images. (3) Multi-data-hiders technology is used to encrypt images and secret data while transmitting marked encrypted images separately. The proposed scheme achieves an average embedding capacity of 4.49 bpp in the BOSSBase dataset and 4.48 bpp in the BOWS-2 dataset. A larger embedding capacity can be achieved by adjusting the filter parameters.}

	abstract = {The widespread usage of user alignment technology raises a number of security and privacy concerns. This study suggests cross-platform network user alignment interference methods based on obfuscation strategy to mitigate the risk of significant protection of user social identity, which is easily mined jointly, for the cross-platform network user alignment algorithm based on social relationship.In order to decrease the accuracy of the classical algorithm for cross-platform alignment and safeguard user privacy, this paper suggests three interference methods based on obfuscation strategy: virtual user deployment strategy, virtual connection deployment strategy, and connection deletion strategy. These methods lower the risk of co-mining significant protected users’ social identities by deploying virtual users, deploying virtual connection relations, and deleting connection relations.This research identifies interference efficiency as appropriate evaluation metric. It is tested on Domain-adversarial Network Alignment and User Identity Linking Algorithm Based on Graph Auto-Encoders using the Foursquare-Twitter social network dataset. When five virtual nodes are added, the virtual user deployment strategy achieves up to 84% interference efficiency; when five similar nodes are added, the virtual connection deployment strategy achieves up to 82% interference efficiency; and when 90% of the target node’s connections are deleted, the connection deletion strategy achieves 80% interference efficiency. All three options offer effective means of protecting user privacy. In the process of actual implementation, it is vital to select the best technique based on the particular situation.}

	abstract = {Toxic Speech (TS) is widely spread in social media and is increasingly harmful to the online networking environment. At the same time, words and their variants containing implicit toxic semantics are influenced by the humanistic and social environment of the language and are extremely rich in form and shape, and the lack of background knowledge related to the "discourse body" of existing research has led to the confusion of Implicit Toxic Speech (ITS) with Non-Toxic Speech (NTS). Therefore, this paper proposes the Prompt-enhanced Attention Head Fusion (PAHF) toxic text classification model based on the generative language model. We optimize the hidden layer vectors by intervening in the hidden layer information through prompt, then filter the vectors by combining linear probes to locate those vectors in the hidden layer information that are strongly correlated with the encoding of the background knowledge, and finally construct an attention fusion mechanism to fuse the filtered features, which provides a higher detection accuracy compared with the existing algorithms.}

To address these issues, this paper proposes ZKFDT, an efficient data fair exchange scheme based on optimized zero-knowledge proof algorithms, offering improvements in efficiency, fairness, and security. In terms of efficiency, ZKFDT leverages IPFS’s hash-based addressing mechanism to significantly reduce network communication overhead compared to traditional data transmission methods, while also optimizing the multi-scalar multiplication algorithm, improving proof generation efficiency by 2x. Regarding security, ZKFDT adopts the more secure ABR23 protocol, addressing the malleability attack vulnerabilities of Groth16 while maintaining its low communication overhead. Through the implementation of smart contracts, including proof verification, atomic swaps, and time-lock functionality, ZKFDT ensures fairness and immutability in data transactions. Experimental results show that ZKFDT demonstrates high efficiency and practical feasibility in large-scale data transaction applications.}

	abstract = {With the growing emphasis on data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a novel distributed machine learning approach. It allows multiple participants to collaboratively train models without sharing their local data. However, ongoing research has shown that even without direct data exchange, sharing model parameters can still lead to privacy breaches. Differential Privacy (DP) helps mitigate this by adding noise to model parameters, ensuring privacy. While effective, this noise can degrade model performance. Therefore, finding a balance between noise injection and model accuracy remains a key challenge.To address this issue, we propose a dynamic noise addition method for hierarchical federated learning. Our method stratifies the model and injects different levels of noise based on each parameter’s contribution to the global model. We introduce a layer-wise asynchronous noise addition strategy. In this strategy, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are divided into shallow and deep layers. Deeper layers receive a larger privacy budget to enhance their protection. Additionally, we prioritize important features in the input layer, applying stricter noise to parameters with higher significance.We validated our algorithm on DNNs using two distinct datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in balancing privacy and model performance.}

	abstract = {The rise in video content has amplified the risk of information leakage, prompting the development of various anonymization techniques. These techniques include traditional methods such as pixelation, blurring, and masking, as well as more advanced approaches like video encryption, which involves encrypting parameters during video encoding, and techniques that subtly alter facial features to prevent identification. However, assessing the effectiveness of these anonymization techniques remains challenging. Common metrics such as the structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), often used for object anonymization in videos, primarily assess image quality and lack accuracy for security evaluation. Furthermore, subjective human evaluations fail to provide the consistent, quantitative data necessary for cross-study comparisons. Given that a single identifiable frame in a video can compromise overall security, this study introduces a quantitative method for evaluating the de-identification rate in regions of interest (ROI) within videos. The proposed approach calculates an object de-identification rate (ODR) by combining SSIM and edge detection ratio (EDR) using a harmonic mean and a power mean. Our proposed method enhances the precision and reliability for security of anonymized video.}

However, existing WE schemes or constructions are either impractical or implement only a part of these WE features. We provide two versions of the scheme. The WE scheme that 1) is based on pairings with the property of flexible decryptors, 2) only applies to some SAT problems, and 3) does not require the decryptor’s communication with an encryptor. The SAT problem can only be partially supported as it is not fully protected against all mixed-input attacks. So We provide another version of the scheme. The Modified Witness Encryption (MWE) scheme via non-interactive Oblivious Transfer (OT) 1) is based on pairings with the property of flexible decryptors, 2) applies to all SAT problems, and 3) still requires the decryptor’s or third-party communication with an encryptor, and the communication can only perform a fixed asynchronous amount of computation at regular intervals, regardless of the number of ciphertexts. At present, there is no witness encryption scheme that can satisfy both non-interactivity and (1), (2) in MWE features and there are many interactive application cases in the application scenarios of witness encryption.}

The proposed network structure is composed of four key components: a preprocessing module, a dense connection module, an attention module, and a regularization module. Central to the attention mechanism, the adaptive weighted attention method utilizes an adaptive weight factor to optimize parameters dynamically, enabling the model to adapt to varying data characteristics. This approach enhances the model’s feature learning and representation capabilities. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments were conducted on two benchmark datasets. In the comparative experiments, our network was evaluated against three well-established networks. The experimental results demonstrated that our network’s recognition performance surpassed that of the other networks by at least 5.6% on one dataset and 10% on the other. And the ablation studies revealed that the proposed method improved recognition performance by at least 2.6% and 5.2% compared to other ablation methods across the two datasets.}

	abstract = {Compressed video action recognition based on traditional codecs, like MPEG-4, H265, etc., has achieved remarkable progress with comparable performance to raw video action recognition. With the development of Neural Video Compression (NVC), action recognition based on NVC should be paid attention to and explored. Firstly, the encoded stream of NVC represents the high-dimension features of the neural network, which allows the features to be utilized for downstream tasks with less additional processing or even directly. Secondly, the high-dimension feature can not be understood by humans, which means the privacy of the raw video frames can be preserved. In this paper, we propose a novel model for compressed video action recognition based on NVC to explore the potential of NVC for action recognition. By introducing spatial and temporal co-attention (ST-CA), the spatial information from the reference frame feature and the temporal information from the motion vector and the residual feature are combined and complemented effectively. The proposed model achieves competitive performance with the traditional compressed video action recognition methods and the raw video action recognition methods on the HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets. Besides, the proposed model preserves the privacy of the raw video frames and has much less computational complexity than the raw video action recognition methods.}

	abstract = {The numerous cyber-attack attribution reports published by cybersecurity organizations serve as essential resources for studying and learning about attribution and are important references for conducting such activities. This paper introduces a hierarchical cyber-attack attribution framework and a method for filling the framework's content through the combined use of manual and large language model (LLM) analysis of cyber-attack attribution reports. Utilizing this approach, lengthy and complex reports can be efficiently analyzed, effectively extracting content for each level of the attribution framework. Since the framework's content is primarily built upon the analysis of a large number of attribution reports by an LLM, it ensures rich and objective framework content. Through the evaluation of the constructed framework, the results indicate that its content can effectively cover the attribution of the primary stages of network intrusions. Existing cyber-attack attribution frameworks often focus on providing macro-level guidance for attribution, whereas this framework includes detailed attribution methods and techniques, offering substantive knowledge support for attribution activities.}

Internet security companies perform analysis of daily malware feeds and one of the challenges in this analysis is the identification of the family of the malware samples. Yara rules using regular expressions are widely applied in the industry to identify malware families, but may fail when malware families are updated. Malware clustering provides an alternative method to discriminate malware families that are not disrupted by minor updates. In this paper, we present Discriminating Malware Families using Partitional Clustering (DMFPC) approach and provide its comparison against previously used malware clustering algorithms, including K-means, Hierarchical, Spectral, and Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The results of this evaluation provide valuable input into the continuing design of the partitional clustering algorithms for malware detection.}

	abstract = {Sophisticated cyberattacks require the expertise of forensic investigators to examine massive volumes of log data and uncover the intricacies of interconnected adversarial techniques across different attack stages. Due to variations in adversarial techniques and fragmented information, investigators often struggle with limited visibility in reconstructing events along the cyber kill chain. We identify statistical correlations of adversarial techniques by modeling their co-occurrences in advanced persistent threats as weighted connections in a graph. Our automated solution includes weighted knowledge graph construction, extraction of adversarial patterns through graph traversal, and detection of adversarial techniques guided by these patterns. Through attack simulations in two case studies, we validate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting adversarial techniques, supporting the identification of attack vectors and the reconstruction of partial kill chains even when some techniques bypass forensic investigation. This research highlights the potential to systematically investigate adversarial patterns, suggesting that future work could improve knowledge graph construction and extraction methods using advanced machine learning techniques for even better results.}

	abstract = {Online social networking sites enable users to create profiles that often contain a broad range of potentially sensitive information, including relationship status, sexual orientation, religion, location, occupation, and interests. Despite the privacy controls offered by most social media platforms, these measures are often insufficient to safeguard users against profile attribute inference attacks, where adversaries infer private information by exploiting publicly accessible data. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian model designed to infer the attributes of users on online social networks by leveraging publicly available profile data and topological features from the target user’s ego graph. Traditional Bayesian inference models rely on the assumption of attribute independence, meaning they treat all profile attributes as equally important and independent of one another, given a class label. However, we contend that this assumption is impractical in the context of social networks, as it directly contradicts the principle of homophily, which posits that individuals tend to form connections with those who share similar characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose WAPITI (Weighted Bayesian Model for Private Information Inference), a weighted Bayesian model tailored for attribute inference in social ego networks. Our approach incorporates attribute weighting to account for the dependencies between attributes, thus providing a more accurate representation of real-world social networks. Through extensive experimental evaluations on real-world datasets of user profiles and ego graphs, we demonstrate that the integration of attribute weighting substantially improves the overall performance of our inference model, yielding higher success rates compared to traditional baseline models.}

	abstract = {Data-driven deep learning methods have made significant strides in attack detection, with provenance graph analysis based on audit logs emerging as a key approach for identifying complex threats. However, the inherent "redundancy" and "dynamic variability" in audit logs pose two major challenges: redundant data leads to inefficient use of computational resources during model training, and shifts in data distribution over time can degrade detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose DI-GAE, a framework that is both resource-efficient and dynamically adaptive. We initially train a graph autoencoder on benign data. As data distribution changes, Behavior Pattern Scores (BPS) are applied at the time-window level to probe new behavioral patterns while filtering out redundant benign data, allowing for dynamic updates through incremental learning. Additionally, we integrate data replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) strategies to ensure the model retains existing patterns while learning new ones. Experimental results demonstrate that DI-GAE not only conserves resources and adapts dynamically but also achieves detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of the model’s components, illustrating its ability to learn new patterns and maintain existing knowledge.}

	abstract = {A malicious insider’s threats who has access to the organization’s systems and is familiar with security policies are difficult to detect and can cause significant financial damage. A reconstruction-based anomaly detection method leveraging deep learning is one method for detecting insider threats. The method is employed to solve a data imbalance problem caused by the scarcity of abnormal data in real environments. The method trains a deep learning model to reconstruct normal data received from all users. After training, the model reconstructs normal data more accurately than abnormal data, and the reconstruction-based anomaly detection method can detect anomalies based on the reconstruction difference between normal and abnormal data. However, existing reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods train on all users’ normal data using the same network parameters. Consequently, if a behavior is normal for one user but abnormal for another, the reconstruction model learns this behavior as normal because the reconstruction model trains only on normal behaviors. Since normal behaviors differ for each user depending on their position, role, and other factors within the organization, it is necessary to develop methods for detecting abnormal behaviors specific to each user. To address this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based insider threat detection method. The proposed method consists of 1) a pre-trained encoder that outputs latent representations of normal data for all users and 2) user-specific decoders assigned to each user, which are trained on the corresponding user’s normal data to reconstruct their normal data. We evaluate the proposed method’s detection rate (DR) and area under the curve (AUC) on the CERT dataset and compare it with a deep learning model trained on normal data from all users. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher DR and AUC than the deep learning model. These results indicate that the proposed method enhances insider threat detection performance by enabling the detection of user-specific abnormal behaviors.}

Current research has extensively explored ML model markets, which are typically coordinated by a single broker acting as an intermediary between data providers and model buyers. However, this solution poses significant challenges due to the monopolistic control it grants the broker. Therefore, we propose a multi-broker market model to overcome these issues. The decision-making processes among multiple brokers are formulated as a multi-stage Stackelberg game designed to maximize the profits of each broker. Subsequently, the existence and uniqueness of nash Equilibrium for brokers’ strategies are proven. We conduct simulation experiments using four types of cost functions for two brokers. The simulation results demonstrate that brokers can reach a Nash Equilibrium through the proposed market model.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has shown great application potential in many fields such as finance, supply chain, and the Internet of Things. As blockchain technology keeps evolving, the issue of insufficient scalability has progressively turned into a crucial bottleneck impeding its further progress. The application of sharding technology to enhance the scalability of blockchain systems has attracted considerable interest from the research community. However, the majority of sharding solutions suffer from a number of problems, including high ratio of cross-shard transactions, prolonged transaction confirmation latency, and unbalanced load among shards. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain sharding method based on dual-constraint label propagating. This sharding method mainly depends on two constraints in the label propagation process to determine whether to perform partition transfers on blockchain accounts. Constraint 1 is to consider the correlation among accounts when splitting accounts. This constraint serves to minimize the cross-shard transactions ratio. Constraint 2 is that the load factor of the blockchain sharding system after the tag update cannot exceed the load factor before the update. This can bring the load of each shard to an almost consistent state, thereby reducing transaction confirmation latency. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare it with the Metis and Monoxide algorithms in three aspects: cross-shard transaction ratio, transaction throughput, and transaction confirmation latency. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the load distribution across individual shards within the blockchain network on both throughput and transaction confirmation latency. The experimental results show that our proposed method makes the load among shards more balanced, thereby reducing the ratio of cross-shard transactions, decreasing the transaction confirmation latency, and increasing the transaction throughput.}

Ethereum, as a pioneer in this domain, offers a platform for decentralized applications but is challenged by the immutability of smart contracts, which makes upgrades cumbersome. Existing design patterns, while addressing upgrad-ability, introduce complexity, increased development effort, and higher gas costs, thus limiting their effectiveness. In response, we introduce FlexiContracts, an innovative scheme that reimagines the evolution of smart contracts on Ethereum. By enabling secure, in-place upgrades without losing historical data, Flexi-Contracts surpasses existing approaches, introducing a previously unexplored path in smart contract evolution. Its streamlined design transcends the limitations of current design patterns by simplifying smart contract development, eliminating the need for extensive upfront planning, and significantly reducing the complexity of the design process.

	abstract = {Federated learning has achieved remarkable results in a variety of decision-making tasks, but may create models that are biased toward some groups due to the labeling bias and distributional differences of client data. Therefore, exploring how to reduce decision-making bias is an urgent problem for future large-scale deployment of federated learning systems into society. The most effective approaches to enhance the fairness of federated learning include preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing algorithms, which improve the fairness and credibility of the models while preserving privacy. However, existing debiasing algorithms are still limited in three aspects: poor fairness enhancement of the global model, high impact on the performance of the main task, and inconsistent evaluation metrics. Motivated by the challenge of group fairness in federated learning, we propose Fedfair, a debiasing algorithm for federated learning systems that differs from previous work in several key aspects: (1) it requires clients to upload a small amount of anonymized data to the server, which allows most centralized debiasing algorithms that rely on data to be applied to federated learning; (2) by mapping the implicit relationship between the model and the group bias, it fine-tunes the global model to reduce the group bias, thus weakening the impact on the model's performance on the main task; (3) it applies a unified fairness evaluation metric, which reasonably and intuitively demonstrates the advantages of debiasing compared to various other algorithms. Experiments verify that compared with other federated learning debiasing algorithms, Fedfair is more efficient, the debiasing effect is more obvious, and the impact on the performance of federated learning models is weaker.}

	abstract = {This study delves into the application of Differential Privacy (DP) in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). We initially discussed the limitations of existing approaches to privacy-preserving graph learning. These limitations primarily stem from an unsatisfied privacy-utility trade-off, as well as their constrained performance across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates DP with privacy amplification techniques and combines it with Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) and differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD). Our approach aims to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off and demonstrate universality across various types of datasets. Through carefully designed privacy attack experiments and comparative baseline evaluations, we demonstrate that compared to existing methods, ours exhibits superior utility with stronger privacy protection in multiple datasets, and sampling-based privacy amplification techniques contribute to improved model expressiveness. In summary, our work contributes to a general and versatile approach to achieving privacy-preserving GCN, offering a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to SOTA.}

	abstract = {Adversarial attacks can cause abnormal behavior in deep neural networks by adding imperceptible perturbations to input data. Adversarial purification is an effective defense method by transforming adversarial data into clean data. Existing purification methods utilize only simple corruptions and specified reconstructors to eliminate perturbations, and thus are non-adaptive to different attack algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive adversarial purification framework, which combines multiple Destruction and Reconstruction (D&R) operations to form a multi-stage D&R chain. The Destruction operations consist of corruptions in both spatial and frequency domains. The Reconstruction operations are implemented by deep networks trained respectively for corresponding corruptions to restore images. The D&R chain is constructed dynamically during purification based on the link probabilities of D&R operations with a self-supervised search algorithm. We test our framework on CIFAR10 datasets under five attacks. The experiment results indicate that the proposed framework can adapt to a wide range of attacks and achieve comparable performance.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a highly targeted, complex, and long-term attack targeting specific organizations or individuals, aimed at stealing sensitive data or disrupting operations. APT is covert, difficult to detect, and may lead to serious economic losses, intelligence leaks, business interruptions, and even affect national security and political stability. Due to the concealment and complexity of APT attacks, coupled with their long duration, current detection solutions face challenges such as high detection difficulty and low accuracy. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a high-precision APT attack detection model CNN-KOA-BiGRU based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), BiGRU deep learning network, and Kepler Optimization Algorithm. The model first uses CNN to extract spatial features from network traffic data, and then uses BiGRU to capture temporal dependencies and long-term patterns, forming comprehensive temporal features. Then, KOA optimized the structure of BiGRU, achieving optimal feature weights and improving detection accuracy. In addition, this paper also combines sampling techniques (SMOTE) and Tomek linking to eliminate classification bias caused by imbalanced datasets. The experimental results on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset show that the average precision of CNN-KOA-BiGRU is 97.03%, 5.61% higher than CNN, 0.82% higher than CNN-BiGRU, and 1.85% higher than GCN.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach that emphasizes privacy protection. However, it faces two main challenges: privacy leakage and communication overhead. Prior work has addressed these issues individually, focusing either on privacy protection or on reducing communication overhead. While some methods claim to address both issues and offer balanced trade-off solutions, they have been shown to fall short in practice. When being applied to large models, they harms the convergence efficiency and effective. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that effectively balances communication efficiency and security while also achieving superior convergence performance compared to existing algorithms. Our proposed series of quantization methods — Terngrad extension, layer-wise quantization, and twice quantization—are designed to enhance both the stability and efficiency of convergence. Experimental results show that compared to similar algorithm, our method can achieve convergence in larger models, demonstrates robust defense against 8 mainstream attack methods, and can accelerate communication speeds by up to 10 times.}

	abstract = {Human action recognition (HAR) based on visible light videos is prone to expose users privacy. Infrared videos and radio signals are well known invisible sensing approaches for HAR with the constraint of privacy preservation. However, either of them holds some inherent weaknesses, which strongly hinder the HAR performance improvement. Considering the complementarity of the different modal data, we suggest to explore both infrared and radio clues to improve the performance of HAR. Specifically, we design a two-branch heterogenous deep neural network to extract IR and WiFi features respectively. Rather than traditional methods, we propose a deep feature fusion approach which nonlinearly projects IR and WiFi features into a common subspace to maximize the correlation between two modalities. To validate our novel ideas, we build a human action dataset comprising IR and WiFi samples. Based on this dataset, a series of elaborate experiments were carried out, which prove that multi modal sensing can significantly improve HAR performance with the constraint of privacy preservation. The proposed feature fusion strategy outperforms other state-of-the-art methods obviously in experiments.}

	abstract = {Metaverse allows users to delegate their AI models to an AI engine, which builds corresponding AI-driven avatars to provide immersive experience for other users. Since current authentication methods mainly focus on human-driven avatars and ignore the traceability of AI-driven avatars, attackers may delegate the AI models of a target user to an AI proxy program to perform impersonation attacks without worrying about being detected.In this paper, we propose an authentication method using multi-factors to guarantee the traceability of AI-driven avatars. Firstly, we construct a user’s identity model combining the manipulator’s iris feature and the AI proxy’s public key to ensure that an AI-driven avatar is associated with its original manipulator. Secondly, we propose a chameleon proxy signature scheme that supports the original manipulator to delegate his/her signing ability to an AI proxy. Finally, we design three authentication protocols for avatars based on the identity model and the chameleon proxy signature to guarantee the virtual-to-physical traceability including both the human-driven and AI-driven avatars.Security analysis shows that the proposed signature scheme is unforgeability and the authentication method is able to defend against false accusation. Extensive evaluations show that the designed authentication protocols complete user login, avatar delegation, mutual authentication, and avatar tracing in about 1s, meeting the actual application needs and helping to mitigate impersonation attacks by AI-driven avatars.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing load trend forecasting is a crucial component in the construction of load balancing systems. However, existing methods fail to sufficiently extract sequence information and capture correlations among multidimensional metrics due to the non-periodicity and non-stationarity of load data. We propose the Dual-domain Dynamic Forecasting Network (DDF-Net), which designs a univariate evolution model to dynamically adjust and guide multivariate predictions through a multi-task joint learning approach. First, a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network with an additional graph learning layer is employed to capture and extract correlations among multivariate metrics, addressing spatiotemporal domain information. Second, an improved empirical wavelet transform and a dissimilar moving averages component are designed to effectively decompose load features, and a BiGRU with an integrated attention mechanism is used to capture long-term dependencies, addressing time-frequency domain information. Ultimately, an attention mechanism component that integrates latent representations from both the spatiotemporal and time-frequency domains is designed. Experiments conducted on load datasets from three real-world platforms demonstrate that the proposed model achieves impressive performance in both single-step and multi-step forecasting tasks.}

A crucial step in combating these attacks lies in promptly and accurately detecting DDoS attack traffic. However, due to data insufficiency (imbalance) and contamination, existing solutions fail to yield satisfactory results for DDoS detection. Furthermore, current methods typically require access to raw data for training, posing a significant privacy risk. To tackle these challenges, we propose HFL-AD, a hierarchical federated learning framework specifically designed for detecting DDoS attack traffic. In our approach, a federation of lower layer clients train local anomaly detection models using diverse raw data. A selected few clients, possessing a small supplementary dataset, serve as upper layer clients, responsible for excluding model updates trained on contaminated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HFL-AD outperforms baseline solutions in DDoS detection, particularly when some training datasets are contaminated.}

This involves the design of a Convolutional Neural Network super-model, called doctor, able to distinguish between healthy networks - trained on clean data, vs unhealthy networks - trained on data contaminated in injection attacks.

	abstract = {Federated learning is a combination of distributed technology and machine learning technology, which does not require model training participants to share their original data, but only requires these participants to share their local models (or gradients) with a third party for aggregation. However, existing researches suggest that shared original models (or gradients) may also lead to privacy breaches for some participants. Some third parties performing aggregation tasks may also return falsified aggregation results to the participants. Thus, federated learning still faces many security challenges. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving verifiable federated learning-based protocol. Specifically, we protect the original model parameters by splitting the model and masking the split model with a mask, which effectively protects the original model parameters even in the case of collusion among multiple entities. In addition, we design a lightweight dropout handling scheme and a verification scheme to allow the participants to quickly verify the aggregation results from the server, which reduces the harmful effects of erroneous model updates on the entire federated learning system. Finally, we test our proposed scheme on several popular public datasets and compare it with several schemes. The experimental results show that our scheme can guarantee high accuracy and verification efficiency even while providing privacy-preserving and verifiable aggregation results.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) nowadays play a vital role in many high-stakes applications due to their powerful data representation capabilities. In recent years, the issue of fairness discrimination in GNNs has gained significant attention. Existing methods endow different concepts of fairness in GNNs, mainly focusing on group and individual fairness, and give corresponding solution frameworks. However, these existing methods usually only consider optimizing one kind of fairness and claim that group and individual fairness are conflicting and cannot be handled together. Such an approach has limitations and lacks practicality for real-world application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a GNN-based framework for resolving the conflict between group and individual fairness, namely BIG (Balancing Individual and Group fairness). First, we expound on the view that group and individual fairness do not conflict and define a novel notion named balanced fairness and the corresponding evaluation metric. Second, we propose the framework structure and algorithm principle of BIG. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of BIG on three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that BIG balances group fairness and individual fairness in GNNs well while ensuring the accuracy of the node classification tasks.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements in various applications. However, the intellectual property of these models often faces risks due to unauthorized reproduction or encapsulation by third parties. In this paper, we propose EasyDetector, a novel approach to detect the provenance of LLMs using linear probes. Our method aims to identify the original source model, even if it has been fine-tuned or encapsulated into another model. Specifically, EasyDetector performs classification on the intermediate layer representations of the new model using linear probes of the original model. Models from the same source exhibit high accuracy, while models from different sources yield low accuracy. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EasyDetector in detecting model provenance. The proposed method is lightweight and applicable to various model architectures, holding significant importance for protecting the intellectual property of LLMs.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of digital currencies, their anonymity has provided shelter for criminals, leading to an increasing number of abnormal transactions that threaten financial order. In response, researchers have proposed centralized methods and federated learning to detect abnormal transactions. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient feature fusion, leading to information loss. In addition, the averaging of client parameters in federated learning negatively affects transaction detection effectiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose a Federated learning-based Multi-angle feature fusion framework for abnormal Transactions Detection, named FMTD. First, an Adaptive Multi-angle Contrastive Learning model (AMCL) is presented as the local model for clients, which improves feature fusion by maximizing positive sample consistency, minimizing negative sample consistency, and assigning higher weights to more effective features. Second, a Federated adaptive algorithm with Adjustable Client Weights (Fed-ACW) is introduced, which reduces the negative impact of poor local models on the global model. While preserving transaction feature privacy, FMTD enhances the transaction detection rate. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.}

We propose a novel approach utilizing image encoding and partitioning to train models on remote servers.

Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of training private datasets on cloud platforms with minimal accuracy loss, offering a high level of privacy at low cost. A critical aspect of our approach lies in its ability to uphold privacy without any modifications to the training software on cloud servers, unlike methods such as homomorphic encryption, which demand the utilization of specialized software.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular across a wide range of applications, but recent research has revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor attack methods often involve complex computational costs, making them less practical in real-world scenarios. Data augmentation, a commonly used technique for improving model generalization, offers an ideal source for trigger generation due to its low computational overhead and the fact that the generated images do not raise suspicion. However, current backdoor attack strategies that employ data augmentation typically rely on randomly selected augmentation techniques, which yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose BGD3A, a novel backdoor attack method driven by a genetic algorithm, optimizing the selection of data augmentation combinations. Attackers can customize the fitness function to generate an optimal combination of augmentation techniques to meet their objectives. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BGD3A not only achieves high attack success rates but also remains robust against state-of-the-art backdoor defense mechanisms.}

	abstract = {As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, advanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are critical for modern network security. Traditional signature-based NIDS are inadequate against zero-day and evolving attacks. In response, machine learning (ML)-based NIDS have emerged as promising solutions; however, they are vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks that subtly manipulate network traffic to bypass detection. To address this vulnerability, we propose a novel defensive framework that enhances the robustness of ML-based NIDS by simultaneously integrating adversarial training, dataset balancing techniques, advanced feature engineering, ensemble learning, and extensive model fine-tuning. We validate our framework using the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Experimental results show, on average, a 35% increase in detection accuracy and a 12.5% reduction in false positives compared to baseline models, particularly under adversarial conditions. The proposed defense against adversarial attacks significantly advances the practical deployment of robust ML-based NIDS in real-world networks.}

Our literature study reveals that a significant portion of this data is either stored in plaintext or experiences reduced throughput when encryption devices are integrated into the network, posing potential security risks. To address the vulnerabilities of plaintext data storage and improve throughput performance, we design a high-performance data encryption device using advanced FPGA technology. Positioned between the server and the disk array, this encryption device secures the data written to the disk array. It achieves a data throughput rate of up to 11.21 Gbps by adopting high-performance hardware platform and designing pipeline-based data processing. It also improves the ability of data encryption device to resist side channel attack by designing diverse SM4 circuit consist of different S-boxes.}

We propose the SC-DQN strategy, combining spectral clustering and deep Q-network (DQN) techniques. Spectral clustering analyzes the spatial distribution of base stations, grouping them and identifying cluster centers as initial deployment sites. A deep reinforcement learning environment then enables each edge server (agent) to iteratively optimize deployment, minimizing latency, energy consumption, and load imbalance. Experiments with Shanghai Telecom data demonstrate that SC-DQN improves load balancing by 23.05%, reduces latency by 45.32%, and lowers energy consumption by 9.64%, outperforming traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Traffic sign recognition systems are crucial for the navigation and situation awareness of autonomous vehicles. They leverage deep learning technologies to swiftly and accurately identify traffic signs, even in the most challenging traffic environments. However, security researchers have uncovered a critical vulnerability in these systems: learning-based TSRs are particularly susceptible to physical-world perturbation attacks. Through subtle modifications (i.e., attaching well-designed patches on traffic signs), attackers can deceive the recognition system into making erroneous judgments, which can further lead to serious traffic accidents. Although several defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the security of sign recognition systems, these solutions generally target only specific types of malicious perturbations and thus lack robustness. To address this issue, we present a robust defense mechanism named Shield-U, which restores traffic sign images contaminated by physical patch perturbations, providing credible data for the recognition model. In the process of implementing Shield-U, we first design a feature difference-aware perturbation generator that outputs potential sign contamination patterns. Incorporating generated perturbations during the training phase enables our restoration model to gain sufficient understanding of diverse perturbation types, thus enhancing its ability to repair various perturbed signs. Following this, we build an attention-driven restoration network to repair sign images. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of Shield-U using widely used sign recognition models and public datasets. The results demonstrate that our defense mechanism excels in resisting potential perturbations, increasing the average sign recognition accuracy by 50.4%.}

	abstract = {Neural networks have become essential to modern applications, excelling in various tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and predictive analytics. In security, they are, among other things, widely used as part of identity verification that often combines automatic recognition with human verification. However, automatized methods are facing challenges from adversarial attacks, where malicious modifications to an input can deceive networks, thus compromising their reliability. With defenses evolving to detect and reverse such attempts, as well as attacked samples not passing manual verification by a human, it raises the question, whether deepfakes such as face swapping and facial reenactment can serve as a new kind of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we explore if deepfakes can deceive neural networks and humans, by analyzing state-of-the-art methods and introducing a novel one-shot face swapping technique that blends reenactment and swapping for high-quality results and improved attack success rates of up to 11% in comparison to current state-of-the-art face swapping techniques.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, the application of UAVs has become increasingly widespread. However, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which serves as a critical navigation technology for UAVs, is susceptible to spoofing attacks, severely impacting flight safety and mission accuracy. Many existing detection methods rely on additional equipment or multi-UAV cooperation for attack detection. This paper proposes an attitude angles-based GNSS spoofing detection method, AttDet, which leverages machine learning algorithm to model the change of UAV attitude and GNSS data. The method conducts feature analysis by examining the close dependency between GNSS data and attitude angle calculations, identifying attitude angles as key data for spoofing detection and extracting their statistical characteristics as feature data. Subsequently, flight experiments are designed to collect real-world data, and various machine learning algorithms are employed for training to select the optimal classifier, which is then deployed on the UAV. The system implements data acquisition and data pre-processing on the UAV, enabling online detection of GNSS spoofing attacks. Based on the collected real and spoofed data, the detection rate reaches 98.86%, with an equal error rate (EER) of 1.15%. Experimental evaluation and comparison demonstrate that this method outperforms existing detection approaches.}

	abstract = {Energy storage is an important part of the new power system, responsible for ensuring stable power output and balancing loads. At the same time, it is also a national critical infrastructure. As the country gradually strengthens its control over data security risks of critical infrastructure, data security issues in the energy storage industry have become a focus of attention. In this context, this paper collects and organizes and analyzes relevant literature on data security in the energy storage industry. First, the energy storage system and energy storage technology are summarized and analyzed, and the data and data characteristics of the energy storage system are explained. Secondly, the current data security risks of the energy storage system are sorted out, including BMS network security risks, user privacy leakage risks, information interaction risks of distributed energy storage systems, smart meter data leakage risks, and trust risks between devices. Based on the above data security risks, the existing energy storage data security governance methods are sorted and classified. Finally, it is summarized that the current research in the field of data security in the energy storage industry is not sufficient. This paper comprehensively analyzes the literature on data security in the energy storage industry in recent years, which will provide support for the research on data security governance in the energy storage industry.}

	abstract = {In the era of big data, information security, particularly during data transmission, has become a top priority. However, existing risk assessments are often limited to local perspectives, missing a global view of data-related risks and hidden relationships. This paper introduces the Dataflow Dynamic Hypergraph (DDHG) framework, which abstracts data flow into a dynamic hypergraph, incorporating key features to better describe the data transfer process. To fully capture this information, we propose the Node-Edge-Hyperedge Autoencoder Graph Network (NEH-AGN), which frames risk assessment as a graph anomaly detection problem, identifying anomalous nodes for risk evaluation. The paper also explores future research directions in data flow scenarios, offering a reference for future work.}

	abstract = {Log data plays a vital role in the maintenance and fault diagnosis of computer systems. However, with the increase of system size and complexity, manual log analysis will take a lot of effort, which makes automated log anomaly detection an important research area. Early rule-based methods can effectively analyze software failures in logs, but require a lot of expert knowledge support. In recent years, with the development of deep learning (DL), automatic detection methods based on learning, such as DeepLog and LogBERT, have improved the efficiency of anomaly detection to a certain extent, but there are still problems such as semantic loss and data imbalance when dealing with massive and diversified log data. In this paper, a novel log anomaly detection model LogContrast is proposed, which is based on BERT pre-training model and realizes semantic analysis of logs through fine tuning. Meanwhile, semi-supervised contrast learning is used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Unlike the previous two efforts, LogContrast does not rely on log templates and does not need to map log information to template ids, but instead uses the original log semantic vectors to adapt to changing log content and application scenarios. We construct a semi-supervised learning log dataset by manually selecting a few logs from the data set according to the log level and marking them accurately. Semi-supervised contrast learning can learn richer and more robust feature representations from unlabeled data, while small amounts of labeled data can be used to tune and optimize the model. Compared with existing methods DeepLog and LogBERT, LogContrast achieves the best F1 scores on the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System),BGL (BlueGene/L) and ThunderBird datasets (85.39%, 93.67%and 97.73%, respectively).The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the LogContrast model.}

	abstract = {Data distillation is a technique to reduce the training data for machine learning models, by which a large training dataset can be reduced to a smaller, more streamlined dataset while retaining the key information of the original dataset and the model's learning capability. Previous research on the security of data distillation has only been done on image data, and the security of text data distillation has not yet been studied. In this paper, we conduct a systematic research on backdoor attack methods for text data in the process of data distillation. Specifically, this paper embeds a backdoor and implements a backdoor attack before and during data distillation of text data. The experimental results show that, relative to embedding the backdoor before the data distillation operation, embedding the backdoor during the distillation process can make the backdoor information more effectively retained in the distilled data, and can achieve a 100% success rate of the attack under the premise of guaranteeing good concealment. These results show that although the data distillation technique can improve the efficiency of model training, its potential security risk should not be ignored.}

	abstract = {Crowd computing in large-scale cellular networks typically involves a significant number of participants, leading to high spectrum interference, reduced communication efficiency, and low user trustworthiness. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes trustworthy and spectrum-efficient crowd computing scheme in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing machine learning-aided multiple antenna technologies usually ignore the pilot contamination, which reduces spectrum efficiency. Here, we leverage the DNN to devise detection and precoding algorithms by inputting an imperfect channel state information (CSI) big data and provides detection and precoding matrices as outputs, where the online-to-offline learning framework offloads the training task to servers to reduce the overhead of base station (BS). With the well-trained DNNs, the BS can generate the detection and precoding matrices with low computation overheads. Especially, minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) triggers between received signals and sources considering channel estimation error are seen as labels to improve spectrum efficiency. Besides, a multi-factor trust model is designed to enhance user authentication security. The simulations and numerical analysis show the proposed scheme can provide higher spectral efficiency, compared to conventional methods.}

	abstract = {With the increasing integration of crowd computing, new vulnerabilities emerge in widely used cryptographic systems like the RSA cryptosystem, whose security is based on the factoring problem. It is strongly advised to avoid using the same modulus to produce two pairs of public-private keys, as the cryptosystem would be rendered vulnerable to common modulus attacks. Such attacks can take two forms: one that aims to factorize the common modulus based on one key pair and the other that aims to decrypt certain ciphertexts generated by two public keys if the keys are co-prime. This paper introduces a new type of common modulus attack on the RSA cryptosystem. In our proposed attack, given one public-private key pair, an attacker can obtain the private key corresponding to a given public key in RSA decryption. This allows the adversary to decrypt any ciphertext generated using this public key. It is worth noting that the proposed attack can be used in the CRT model of RSA. In addition, we propose a parallelizable factoring algorithm with an order equivalent to a cyclic attack in the worst-case scenario.}

	abstract = {Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) networks aim to leverage users’ mobile devices to collect environmental or activity information, thereby supporting a wide range of applications. Although large-scale participation of mobile users drives the application and development of MCS networks, it also introduces new security challenges. Due to the diversity and uncertainty of users in MCS networks, trust relationships are difficult to evaluate accurately. This paper introduces the concept of Zero Trust and designs a Zero Trust-based architecture for MCS networks to enhance system security. To address the issue of Zero Trust continuous authentication that consumes network resources and impacts system transmission efficiency, this paper proposes the concept of Age of Trust (AoT), where a higher trust level corresponds to a lower AoT value. The paper tackles the bi-objective optimization problem between the average AoT and throughput on a single link in MCS networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a reasonable trade-off between security performance and transmission efficiency, showcasing broad application potential in various zero-trust architectures.}

	abstract = {Due to security risks such as data theft, data tampering, and replay attacks during data sharing, data owners need to establish a trust relationship before sharing their data. To reduce the burdens of data retrieval, how to generate an efficient and secure index has become a challenge. Crypto-based solutions currently only encrypt the data to ensure confidentiality, which ignore the integrity and correctness of the sharing data. An hash-based authentication structures called Merkle Tree is an effective tool for data integrity verification. However, it incurs high maintenance costs when dealing with dynamically changing datasets and is limited by data modalities. In this paper, we propose a trustworthy index for multimodal data sharing (MT-Index). Specifically, we propose a Merkle tree based on the Semantic Web, replacing traditional data labels with semantic graphs to represent the content of data blocks. We utilize timestamp to mark the update operations and store them in the leaf nodes of the tree, so as to effectively handle multimodal data and dynamic dataset changes. Additionally, we design a trust network based on zero-knowledge proofs, utilizing ZK-STARKs to ensure the credibility of one-to-one interactions, and implement a two-round protocol to verify the trust mechanism among multiple parties. Through formal analysis, we demonstrate that MT-Index achieves the desired security objectives with minimal storage and generation overhead.}

	abstract = {Mobile Crowd Computing (MCC) leverages the collaborative power of nearby devices to solve resource-intensive tasks, offering transformative potential across various fields. However, ensuring device reliability—which directly impacts the trustworthiness of devices in MCC environments—poses a significant challenge. Balancing validation accuracy with performance and energy efficiency is particularly difficult due to MCC’s dynamic and resource-constrained decentralized nature. Existing validation methods are not feasible in MCC, as they can negatively affect speed and energy consumption. This paper introduces the Honeybee-RS framework, a novel approach for validating offloaded computational results in MCC environments. Honeybee-RS provides delegator-based validation mechanisms and derives reliability scores from the validation process. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these mechanisms, significantly enhancing reliability in MCC while maintaining performance.}

	abstract = {Anomalous network traffic poses significant threats to network security, compromising network stability and data privacy. While many researchers leverage deep packet inspection techniques to accomplish traffic modeling, they often struggle with the risk of information redundancy and feature noise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly network traffic detection framework that focuses on packet payload analysis, which contains the key information within network packets. Our framework primarily consists of two components: feature extraction using a semi-supervised approach and distribution modeling via contrastive learning. First, we employ a reconstruction model to acquire the compact representation for the normal traffic during first stage of training. In the second stage of training, we introduce the contrastive learning into anomaly traffic detection, enhancing the learning of packet payloads. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-domain noise generation method, which fabricates pseudo-anomaly samples through a more generalized strategy. During training, a classifier with a hard-sample triplet loss is developed effectively to distinguish pseudo-anomaly samples and original normal samples, archiving the precise classification decisions. For inference, we employ embedded difference produced by the trained classifier to assess the anomaly. Extensive evaluations on three real-world traffic datasets show our framework archives optimal performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in network anomaly detection.

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced computer vision tasks, but their increasing complexity poses challenges for efficient inference, particularly on resource-constrained devices. We present DualConvNet, a novel CNN architecture that enhances inference efficiency through two key innovations: compressed convolutions and reparameterization. Compressed convolutions reduce computational complexity by selectively processing input channel subsets during both training and inference. For inference, we introduce a reparameterization technique that merges the multi-branch structure into a single, efficient operation, significantly improving speed. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k demonstrate DualConvNet’s effectiveness, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and inference speed. On the COCO dataset, DualConvNet shows competitive accuracy in object detection and instance segmentation tasks while substantially reducing GPU latency. Ablation studies validate the impact of our dual-strategy approach, revealing significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to alternative designs. These results demonstrate DualConvNet’s effectiveness in improving inference efficiency while maintaining high accuracy across various tasks and datasets, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications in resource-constrained scenarios.}

	abstract = {Counterfactual learning has become promising for understanding and modeling causality in complex and dynamic systems. This paper presents a novel method for counterfactual learning in the context of multivariate time series analysis and forecast. The primary objective is to uncover hidden causal relationships and identify potential interventions to achieve desired outcomes. The proposed methodology integrates genetic algorithms and rigorous causality tests to infer and validate counterfactual dependencies within temporal sequences. More specifically, we employ Granger causality to enhance the reliability of identified causal relationships, rigorously assessing their statistical significance. Then, genetic algorithms, in conjunction with quantile regression, are used to exploit these intricate causal relationships to project future scenarios. The synergy between genetic algorithms and causality tests ensures a thorough exploration of the temporal dynamics present in the data, revealing hidden dependencies and enabling the projection of outcomes under hypothetical interventions. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real-world data, showcasing its ability to handle complex causal relationships, revealing meaningful counterfactual insights, and allowing for the prediction of outcomes under hypothetical interventions.}

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on the prevalence and impact of half-closed TCP connections in public cloud LB gateways. Our trace data analysis reveals that, on average, these connections account for 9.26% of new connections and consume 16.14% more memory resources compared to fully active connections. Through a series of experiments, we investigate the role of popular HTTP libraries in causing half-closed connections and identify specific implementation patterns that contribute to this behavior. To address this, we propose feasible approaches and demo code to reduce the number of such half-closed connections on both the gateway and client sides.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of new industrialization, production processes or scenarios characterized by automation and intelligence require monitoring by more powerful visual inspection tools to maintain production continuity, safety, and efficiency. Spike vision sensors, with their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, can capture subtle changes of high-speed moving objects in complex industrial environments, providing precise data support for equipment maintenance, fault detection, and condition monitoring. However, in industrial scenarios, factors such as mechanical vibrations, electromagnetic interference, and extreme strong light affect the quality of sensor data, leading to higher noise levels and increased probability of data loss and errors. To address this, we propose a multi-stage processing method for spike data processing and image reconstruction. It first performs preliminary feature extraction and denoising through an anti-noise feature encoder. Building on this, it integrates features and enhances consistency through spatiotemporal information utilization. Finally, it reconstructs the images through an fine-tuned spike reconstruction model. Experimental results show that our method can effectively reduce noise and improve data quality, achieving good performance on industrial datasets. This provides higher quality data support for downstream tasks such as predictive maintenance and high-speed production inspection in industrial scenarios.}

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for detecting fraud in trade orders within supply chains. The increasing prevalence of order fraud in supply chains poses a significant threat to the economic interests and reputations of organizations. Traditional fraud detection methods have limitations when addressing high-dimensional nonlinear data; however, the KAN model, with its superior nonlinear fitting capabilities and ability to learn complex data patterns, has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling this issue. In this study, we employ a high-dimensional dataset comprising a substantial number of actual trade orders and construct a KAN model for order fraud detection through systematic data cleaning and feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the KAN model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and other neural network models in identifying fraudulent orders, excelling in several evaluation metrics, including accuracy and F1 score. Furthermore, the KAN model exhibits enhanced robustness in addressing the data imbalance problem and effectively reduces the false alarm rate. This study not only validates the application potential of the KAN model in supply chain risk management but also offers new ideas and methodologies to further advance fraud detection technology.}

	abstract = {Hyperspectral image classification methods based on graph convolution network have received extensive attention. However, the traditional distance metric is difficult to fully represent the spectral variability and uncertainty in hyperspectral images. In order to alleviate this problem, a multi-scale fuzzy graph convolutional network is constructed for hyperspectral image classification. In detail, the SLIC algorithm is used to perform superpixel segmentation of hyperspectral images. Each superpixel is regarded as a graph node, and a fuzzy measurement mechanism is introduced to measure the similarity between two nodes to describe the uncertainty between pixels in the hyperspectral image, so as to construct a fuzzy graph convolution. Subsequently, the fuzzy graph convolution is extended to multi-scale to capture the rich contextual information within the hyperspectral image. In the training process, the pixel-level features are integrated into the superpixel-level graph update process to establish the connection between the pixel level and the superpixel level. Finally, experimental results on two publicly available hyperspectral image datasets show that the proposed network outperforms other representative peers.}

	abstract = {In the process of coal mine production, coal mine underground video surveillance is of great significance for enhancing coal mine safety production by analyzing and predicting sudden abnormalities in the coal mine production process in advance. However, it is difficult to ensure the safety of personnel by relying solely on human labor, and along with a large number of deep learning network models being proposed in recent years, it has become a challenge to apply target detection to actual mineral production environments. In this paper, we propose an improved RTMDet-Based target detection algorithm for underground coal mine to solve the problems of lack of real-time performance of video surveillance and restricted edge devices that are not easy to be deployed by combining knowledge distillation with target detection model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, the improved RTM-CMD model is compared with the RTMDet model and several mainstream target detection models in a comparison experiment. The experimental results show that the improved RTM-CMD model does not cause any significant loss of accuracy compared to the benchmark model in a resource-constrained environment, while still ensuring high accuracy compared to the rest of the models.}

	abstract = {Mobile devices especially smartphones have been widely adopted in people’s daily lives. Due to the convenience and computing capability, users are likely to store their private data on the phones, making them a target for cyber-criminals. With an increase of public charging stations, charging attacks have become a big threat on users’ private information. Juice filming charging (JFC) attack is a particular charging threat, which can infer users’ private information through automatically recording phone screen during the whole charging period. Due to the nature of monitoring phone screen, the actual effect of JFC attack depends heavily on users’ charging habits. However, this issue has not been widely investigated in the literature. Motivated by this, our work presents an empirical study to investigate how phone users may interact with their phones during the charging period. The study reveals that up to 97.1% participants would use their phones during the phone charging process (i.e., chatting with their friends), resulting in an unneglectable issue of privacy leakage in practice.}

	abstract = {As a result of its low search cost, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has recently received a lot of interest. Nowadays, most methods based on DARTS only focus on improving a single indicator (e.g., accuracy), making the search process more inclined to complex networks with more robust representational capabilities. Hence, the architectures searched by these methods tend to own high latency, leading to DARTS in some low-latency scenarios or edges with limited computing power, and on-device deployment becomes difficult. To deal with this challenge, we propose a Hardware Latency-Aware Differentiable Search (HL-DARTS) algorithm. This algorithm designs a multi-layer regression network that uses the soft attention mechanism to predict the latency on the corresponding hardware devices, thus adding a differentiable latency loss term based on the DARTS algorithm. We further propose an adaptive constraint amplitude—a mechanism for balancing accuracy and latency while searching for a latency-friendly architecture for a given hardware device. We conduct ablation experiments on different datasets and different hardware devices. The experimental results show that HL-DARTS can find the ideal architecture for different hardware devices and that this architecture is also broadly applicable to various datasets.}

	abstract = {In the design process of nuclear reactors, high-fidelity numerical simulations of thermo-hydraulic processes play a crucial role in evaluating the feasibility and safety of design schemes. These simulations involve complex physical processes such as coolant flow, thermal conduction, and heat transfer, necessitating the use of high-precision numerical algorithms and efficient parallel optimization methods. While mainstream commercial software is widely used in reactor design, it often falls short when it comes to meeting customized experimental scenarios and faces limitations in parallel scalability and physical model adaptability. Hence, the development of independent thermo-hydraulic parallel applications becomes essential. This paper focuses on conducting large-scale refined thermo-hydraulic analysis of core fuel rod bundles using the self-developed software YHACT. The paper elucidates the model algorithm design, parallel implementation, and analysis of test results. Two typical cases were selected for verification by comparing the obtained results with those from FLUENT. Emphasis was placed on the large-scale parallel simulation of fluid-solid coupled convection heat transfer phenomena between fuel rod bundles, utilizing a mesh scale exceeding 100 million cells. This breakthrough overcomes the scale limitations encountered with commercial software, and promises to foster further research and development in related fields.}

In complex indoor environment, traditional positioning methods encounter challenges related to accuracy and cost due to unpredictable attenuation, multipath interference, and other factors. This paper designs a Machine Learning Enhanced Indoor Positioning method that utilizes RIS-aided Channel Configuration and Analysis, called RCCA-MLEIP, for large-scale warehouse applications. This method consists of two stages: the RIS-aided Channel Configuration and Analysis (RCCA) stage, and the Machine Learning Enhanced Indoor Positioning (MLEIP) stage. In the RCCA stage, multiple RISs are deployed to create reflection paths associated with product tags. The phase coefficients of the RISs are adjusted multiple times, and the mixed signals observed by the reader after each adjustment are recorded. Based on these mixed signals, a system of equations is established to resolve both the phase fading and amplitude fading of each reflection path. In the MLEIP stage, a feature dataset is created using simulation methods, consisting of the phase fading and amplitude fading of multiple reference tags analyzed in the RCCA stage. We use the coordinates of the reference tags as the label dataset to train a Back Propagation (BP) neural network. The trained model can then output the coordinates of a target product tag based on the channel fading features associated with that tag, which are solved/obtained in the RCCA stage. The proposed RCCA-MLEIP utilizes RIS to create a multipath environment for positioning, effectively reducing the hardware costs of the positioning system. Moreover, employing machine learning techniques to estimate the target position can enhance both accuracy and response speed.}

	abstract = {Over recent decades, air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has garnered significant attention due to its detrimental effects on human health. As a result, accurately forecasting air quality has become a critical objective to inform and guide policy-making. However, in developing countries, due to their financial constraints, the prediction ability mostly depends on sparsely distributed monitoring devices, which are insufficient. Various prediction approaches utilizing deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, have been developed to address this gap. Despite their promise, these models encounter challenges, including slow preprocessing times and limited adaptability to changing air quality conditions. This paper proposes a simple Encoder-Decoder model for predicting hourly and daily PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, this paper implements an automated system that collects and processes real-time data, continuously updating the model to respond to emerging trends and variations in pollution levels. The model’s performance is evaluated in Vietnam’s two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, demonstrating prediction accuracy in various scenarios.}

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), digital technology has been adopted on livestock farms. In this study, a system for monitoring the health status of dairy cows is proposed, utilizing multi-type sensor fusion and IoT technology. The system uses physiological and behavioral data obtained from a tail sensor attached to the cows to establish prenatal and estrus prediction models. Additionally, environmental sensors installed in the barn monitor parameters such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and organic gas concentration to automatically regulate the barn’s fan and sprinkler based on preset threshold values. The system also monitors the health and tail behavior of the cows and predicts their calving and estrus times based on the collected data. Experimental results demonstrate that the system exhibits high accuracy and reliability in monitoring the health of dairy cows.}

	abstract = {Digital healthcare has improved the efficiency and quality of medical services by integrating sensing technology, thereby enhancing the medical service in specific fields. The application of digital healthcare in fracture treatment has yet to be fully explored. Many patients with fractures may suffer from sequelae such as wrist pain and limited mobility due to lack of follow-up, failure of the splint, and other reasons. This study proposes a digital Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) splint for treating distal radius fracture, which applies sensing technology in TCM orthopedic methods to address existing shortcomings, such as the inability to accurately monitor the splint's tightness and the skin's condition by integrating multi-sensors to monitor the pressure, temperature, and humidity of the radius fracture site in real-time. Experimental data has been collected to prove the effectiveness of the proposed digital splint.}

	abstract = {Compared to traditional passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), active RISs can actively amplify incident signals, enhancing signal strength, reducing path-loss, and extending coverage. In this paper, we investigate an active RIS-assisted full-duplex integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. By jointly designing the power allocation factor for communication user equipment (UE) and the reflecting coefficients of the active RIS, the long-term average sensing performance is maximized while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for all UEs. In this paper, we explore a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to address the complex non-convex optimization problem, aiming to maximize long-term gains in system sensing performance. Simulation results indicate that the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm achieves superior performance compared to two benchmark algorithms, and that active RIS demonstrates enhanced capabilities over traditional RIS.}

	abstract = {The received signal strength (RSS) is an important indicator of the strength of a received signal. The signal propagation model is crucial for calculating the RSS. However, the RSS can vary and be unstable even in the same location, so it requires a more flexible calculation method to adapt to complex scenarios. In this article, we propose an automatic calculation method that can adjust the parameters according to the measured RSS. First, some outliers are removed from the measurements. Second, to ensure the accurate calculation of indoor signals, the propagation parameters are adjusted based on the actual measurement data from different indoor scenarios. Finally, segmental correction of the RSS is used to account for faster signal attenuation at closer ranges and slower attenuation at farther ranges. The performance of the corrected algorithm has been verified under various conditions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can enhance the accuracy of signal calculations.}

Concurrently, the rapid advancement of quantum computers presents significant challenges to cross-domain authentication based on traditional cryptographic systems due to decryption issues. To address the issue of sharing identity authentication information across different trust domains, this paper introduces a lattice-based cross-domain encryption transmission scheme. This scheme resists quantum attacks and facilitates cross-domain identity authentication by pre-storing public parameters in the verifier entity and constructing a quantified trust relationship model between nodes within the cross-domain mechanism. This approach further enhances the security of keys and the authentication efficiency between nodes.}

	abstract = {Differential-privacy federated learning (DP-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate the inherent risks associated with traditional FL architectures, which are susceptible to inferential attacks due to the continuous sharing and updating of model parameters. However, existing DP-FL frameworks typically assume that the perturbations introduced by clients remain constant throughout the FL process, overlooking the dynamic influence of these perturbations on model performance across different communication rounds. In this paper, we present a long-term privacy-preserving FL framework designed to address issues of optimal incentive design, considering the dynamic influence of perturbations on model performance. Specifically, we first analyze the effect of local perturbations on the model’s convergence performance during various communication rounds, elucidating the balance between learning performance and privacy loss. Then, to harmonize learning performance with privacy loss, we develop a long-term privacy-preserving incentive scheme, where the interactions between clients and the FL server throughout the FL process are modeled as a multi-stage privacy-preserving game. Furthermore, we utilize contract theory to derive the equilibrium of this game. Finally, simulations show that our scheme can incentivize clients to contribute high-quality models, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the global model, as compared to benchmarks.}

	abstract = {The emergence of distributed machine learning has greatly improved the speed of machine learning model training, however, distributed machine learning is prone to be damaged by Byzantine attacks in practical applications leading to model training failure. In this paper, we investigate the security of distributed machine learning with parameter server architecture and propose a distributed machine learning strategy that can resist malicious attacks. And based on this strategy, a distributed machine learning framework is built using lightweight techniques. The strategy is designed as follows: for the case where the training node suffers from Byzantine attack, the Byzantine fault-tolerant stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used to carry out local gradient aggregation; for the case where the central node of distributed machine learning suffers from malicious attack, the consensus node is selected by using the consensus mechanism of the union chain, and the average gradient of the consensus node is used instead of the global gradient to participate in the training of the global model. The experimental environment is constructed through containerization technology to simulate the distributed machine learning network with high fidelity and low resource consumption. The experimental results show that the anti-Byzantine attack strategy proposed in this paper can effectively defend against Byzantine attacks. Under the same malicious attack scenario, its model accuracy is improved by about 20% compared to the distributed machine learning framework with traditional parameter server architecture.}
