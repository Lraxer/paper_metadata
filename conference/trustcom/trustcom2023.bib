	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are low-and-slow attack patterns and difficult to detect due to their strong concealment. Recently, provenance-based method demonstrates promising prospect in APT detection. However, existing approaches suffer from following several limitations. First, rule-based models heavily rely on domain-specific knowledges and sophisticated matching mechanism from rules to system logs. Second, current anomaly-based techniques require attack-free data to train model and hard to acquire fine-grained detection results to locate attack events. An important reason for undermining the detection capacity of model is the notorious dependency explosion problem and data imbalance problem. Both of problems make the vector representations of benign events and attack events similar, therefore, the model can not differentiate them well. In this paper, we propose DeepDist, which can enhance the entity vector representation by contrastive learning. In this way, we force the projection of benign and attack entities into different feature regions to improve the detection ability of the model. Then we correlate these detected entities to constitute attack events. During our evaluation against thirteen real APT attack scenarios of two datasets, DeepDist shows the detection results with high accuracy.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threat (APT) attack leverages various intelligence-gathering techniques to obtain sensitive and critical information, imposing increasing threats to modern software enterprises. However, due to the persistent presence of APT attacks, it is difficult to effectively analyze a large amount of audit data for detecting such attacks, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This limitation hinders security operation centers (SOC) from promptly handling APT attacks. In this paper, we propose an attack path-based method (APM) for APT attack detection on few-shot learning. Specifically, APM first identifies candidate malicious entities from the provenance graph, contributing to the completion of the missing attack paths. Secondly, we propose a systematic method to exploit potential attack behaviors in the attack path based on the identified candidate malicious entities. We evaluate APM through five APT attacks in realistic environments. Compared to existing baselines, the precision, recall, and F1-score of APM for attack detection increased by 0.28%, 1.64%, and 1.13%, respectively. The results show that our proposal can outperform baseline approaches and effectively detect APT attacks based on few-shot learning.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the emergence of targeted cleanlabel poisoning attacks, which maliciously influence the training data without controlling over the labeling process to manipulate the behavior of the predictive model, is shown to be crucial threats to compromise deep learning systems. Prior targeted clean-label poisoning attacks have been demonstrated to target only one sample at a time, which is not always applicable in restricted real-world situations. In this paper, we explore targeted clean-label poisoning attacks on a per-class basis, which refers to misclassify samples from a victim class to the desired class while maintaining the classification accuracy of samples on other classes in multi-class classification tasks. To achieve this, we present the first class-targeted clean-label poisoning attack, called CTCL, which firsts craft clean label poisons along with multiple directions in the target feature space and enhance the attacking capability of poisons by reducing their the feature information of the target class. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CTCL on various deep neural network models. The experiment results demonstrate that our attack is effective, with the attacking success rate over 80% compared to the other two baseline attacks on average, while the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art defenses is lower than 65% illustrating that CTCL can escape the detection of existing defenses readily.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent methodology for collaboratively training machine learning models among multiple participants while alleviating data privacy leakage through data localization. However, recent studies have shown that the transferred intermediate parameters still contain sensitive information that needs to be further protected. More-over, real-world institutions often possess diverse data attributes, necessitating the adoption of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) for cooperative learning tasks. Existing researches in VFL have proposed some frameworks with privacy-preservation functionality, yet they suffer from high participant overhead or low model accuracy, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose EzBoost, a fast and secure vertical federated tree boosting framework built upon XGBoost. Specifically, we leverages the efficient Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) framework, EzPC, to facilitate the design and implementation of EzBoost. By carefully designing our framework with two non-collusive servers for secure two-party computation, EzBoost significantly accelerates the runtime of model training and querying at most 20×, and reduces the participant overheads at most 300×. In addition, we identify a potential privacy leakage problem in recent researches and propose a more robust solution for addressing it. Through comprehensive security analysis and comparative experiments with existing approaches, we demonstrate that EzBoost achieves stronger privacy-preservation, higher accuracy and higher efficiency simultaneously.}

	abstract = {Entity alignment aims to match identical entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). In recent years, entity alignment methods for encyclopedic KGs have achieved significant effectiveness. However, the characteristics of KGs of some specific domains differs from encyclopedic KGs, so that encyclopedic entity alignment methods do not perform well in domain KGs. Vulnerability KGs are a typical type of domain KG characterized by a large number of entities and limited structural variations, but strong heterogeneity across different graphs. The neighborhood matching-based entity alignment methods are effective on vulnerability KGs. However, previous neighborhood matching methods have primarily focused on aligning neighborhoods where both entities and relations are aligned simultaneously, neglecting the neighborhoods where only entities are aligned. Vulnerability KGs typically contain a large number of entities but have a limited types of relations. As a result, each relation often connects a significant number of entities. Incorrect matching of relations can potentially result in incorrect matching of all connected entities, leading to severe error propagation.In this paper, we propose a neighborhood matching based method VNM, for entity alignment in vulnerability KGs. VNM considers two layers of neighborhood, that is, the neighborhood that entities and relations both align and the neighborhood that only entities align. Our method not only mitigates the error propagation caused by incorrect relation matching but also leverages richer neighborhood information. Additionally, inspired by the phenomenon of semantic translation in word embeddings, we introduce a regularizer for semantic embedding of one-to-many and many-to-one relations in vulnerability KGs. Experimental results on four real-world vulnerability datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.}

	abstract = {Traditional neural networks are static: their network structure and parameters remain fixed regardless of the input samples after the networks are trained. In contrast, dynamic neural networks are capable of dynamically adapting their structures and parameters when processing different input samples, e.g., with early exiting and layer skipping, to achieve more efficient use of resources and more effective feature representation. These capabilities make dynamic neural networks a promising area of development for deep learning, with the potential to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of neural network models.Previous research has demonstrated that the search space of static neural network structures can be significantly reduced by analyzing cache access traces. To date, the side channel risks associated with dynamic neural networks remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on the side-channel leakages of dynamic neural networks which are used to infer the network structure. We conduct both theoretical and experimental validation on a typical dynamic Layer-skipping DNNs structure, SkipNet, and show that the adaptive nature of dynamic DNNs leads to greater side-channel information leakage compared to traditional neural network structures. Specifically, our findings reveal that the network structure space of dynamic DNNs can be significantly reduced, from 366080 57 × 2 12 × (2 64 − 1) 2 to 11286.}

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have played an important role in explaining the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and identifying opportunities for prevention. Early CVD intervention can prevent the progression of these diseases and effectively lower the mortality rate. In particular, using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores has been proven to enhance the prediction of coronary heart disease events. Thus, the early prediction of high-risk CAC allows individuals to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) from progressing to extreme symptoms and illnesses. The process of identifying and using various predictors to predict CAC has received increasing attention, which has helped clinicians and patients make informed decisions. In this discipline, traditional methods rely on statistical approaches to calculate the effects of clinical and demographic factors on CAC score prediction, enabling the identification of relevant features. However, with the advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques, it is now possible to train CAC models that offer highly accurate and stable predictions. This research investigates the application of non-parametric methods to identify and present non-linear relationships within cardiovascular disease datasets derived from the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia, without assuming normal distributions. Furthermore, we will focus on efficient feature extraction to handle the dataset effectively. Additionally, we will explore the utility of regularised regression for predicting CAC scores.}

	abstract = {Over the past few years, a tremendous growth of machine learning was brought about by a significant increase in adoption and implementation of cloud-based services. As a result, various solutions have been proposed in which the machine learning models run on a remote cloud provider and not locally on a user’s machine. However, when such a model is deployed on an untrusted cloud provider, it is of vital importance that the users’ privacy is preserved. To this end, we propose Learning in the Dark – a hybrid machine learning model in which the training phase occurs in plaintext data, but the classification of the users’ inputs is performed directly on homomorphically encrypted ciphertexts. To make our construction compatible with homomorphic encryption, we approximate the ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions using low-degree Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed us to build Learning in the Dark – a privacy-preserving machine learning model that can classify encrypted images with high accuracy. Learning in the Dark preserves users’ privacy since it is capable of performing high accuracy predictions by performing computations directly on encrypted data. In addition to that, the output of Learning in the Dark is generated in a blind and therefore privacy-preserving way by utilizing the properties of homomorphic encryption.}

	abstract = {With the development of computer vision, License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems are widely employed in various applications, including traffic management and intelligent transportation. However, recent studies have shown that these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which significantly undermine their accuracy and reliability. Existing works typically fall into evasion attacks and model poisoning attacks, which often lack feasibility and stealthiness. In contrast, data poisoning attacks have the advantage of being more practical and effective in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel data poisoning attack against LPR systems, which leverages gradient matching to generate poison samples that can mislead the recognition module of the systems. Notably, we focus on a challenging scenario, where we control only a small fraction of training data and attack a model trained from scratch without being perceptible. Moreover, we conduct experiments to validate our attack on the benchmark dataset CCPD2019 and demonstrate that our attack achieved outstanding performance by manipulating only 1% of the training data with perturbations less than 8 pixels in ℓ ∞ -norm. Our work highlights the potential vulnerabilities of LPR systems and encourages research into more trustworthy systems.}

There is a desideratum to provide robust mitigation techniques against this attack that will not affect utility. One of the state-of-the-art frameworks in this area is SELENA, which has two phases: Split-AI and Self-Distillation to train a protected model. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to the Split-AI phase, which tries to weaken the membership inference by using the Jacobian matrix norm and entropy. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach can decrease the memorization of the machine-learning model for three datasets: Purchase100, CIFAR-10, and SVHN, more than SELENA in the same range of utility in a setting in which we do not know any member of the training data.}

	abstract = {LiDAR perception is widely deployed in high-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) to gain accurate information about the driving environment, where 3D semantic segmentation plays a critical role as it can provide more fine-grained scene understanding than other tasks. The mainstream LiDAR perception systems mainly adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve good performance. However, densely annotating LiDAR point clouds and training complex LiDAR segmentation models are time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is common for ordinary self-driving developers to outsource the data annotation or model training task to third-party platforms, which could inevitably expose a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we propose BadLiSeg, the first work to investigate backdoor attacks against LiDAR semantic segmentation. Specifically, we present a general attack strategy based on which the attacker can inject a dynamic backdoor into the victim model by constructing a trigger pattern pool and a location pool. Afterward, the attacker can choose a common physical object (e.g., drone and traffic sign) as the trigger and place it around an arbitrary location in a selected area to easily fool the backdoored LiDAR segmentation model. Our extensive experiments on five representative segmentation models and one public dataset demonstrate that BadLiSeg can not only achieve a high attack success rate but also maintain the normal segmentation performance of the backdoored model. We further show the effectiveness of BadLiSeg on some practical attack scenarios collected from a high-fidelity simulator.}

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) widely deploy LiDAR-based 3D object detection to accurately perceive and understand the surrounding environment. The mainstream LiDAR detection systems primarily adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve satisfactory performance. However, annotating large amounts of LiDAR data and training complex LiDAR detection models are time-consuming and resource-intensive. A common practice for some individual developers and self-driving companies is to outsource data annotation or model training tasks to third-party platforms, which could expose a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we propose BadLiDet, a simple yet effective backdoor attack against LiDAR object detection in autonomous driving. Specifically, we present a model-agnostic attack strategy that enables an attacker to inject a shape-independent backdoor into the victim model by poisoning its training data. Afterward, the attacker can choose an ordinary object in different shapes as the trigger and place it around a specific location to easily deceive the LiDAR detection system. Our extensive experiments on five representative models and a public dataset demonstrate that BadLiDet can achieve a high attack success rate while preserving the utility of victim models. We further show the effectiveness of BadLiDet on the continuous attack scenario collected from a high-fidelity simulator. Moreover, the end-to-end simulation evaluation on an open-source self-driving platform shows that BadLiDet can cause a 100% vehicle collision rate.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an astonishing explosion in the evolution of mobile applications powered by deep learning (DL) technologies. Considering that inference of DL models in the cloud requires transferring user data to server, which is prone to the risk of user privacy leakage, many developers choose to deploy the models on local devices for executing the inference process. However, this also raises a number of other security issues, such as adversarial attacks, model stealing attacks, etc. To explore the security issues that exist in deep learning applications (DL apps), we conducted the first comprehensive comparative study of the top 200 apps in each category on Google Play. We built DLApplnspector, a vulnerability detection tool that combines dynamic and static analysis methods for dissecting apps, which helped us automate our empirical study on real-world mobile DL apps. First, we identify DL apps and extract their models by using DL Checker. Subsequently, Static Scoper is provided to detect encryption and reusability of DL models. Finally, within Dynamic Scoper, we use reverse engineering techniques on the network traffic to parse out the packets and collect side-channel information during application runtime. Our research shows that the majority of developers prefer to use open-source models, with almost 92% of models successfully parsed. This suggests that most models are unprotected. DL apps are more likely to upload user behaviour and collect private data than Non-DL apps. We provide security recommendations for developers and users to address the issues discovered.}

So far, there has been little attention paid to solutions for protecting the privacy of new datasets. In our work, we explored a object detection solution on the WIDER FACE dataset by anonymizing the dataset using face synthesis and enhancing the WIDER FACE dataset by balancing facial features along the dimensions of gender and skin color. Using both the original dataset and our enhanced dataset to train the target detection model, our target detection results show that our model can maintain detection performance while preserving privacy and partially balancing bias.}

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have various applications in real-life scenarios. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially Graph Injection Attacks (GIAs). The flexible and high-risk GIAs pose a significant threat by injecting malicious nodes into the graph. Regrettably, defense strategies to resist GIAs are still scarce. The current defenders lack comprehensive strategies that can effectively resist a wide range of injection techniques. Particularly, when confronted with highly unnoticeable GIAs, the performance of these defenses is significantly diminished. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective GIA defense method named Faithful INjection DefendER (FINDER). FINDER evaluates the impact of the nodes on their neighbors in the context of message aggregation to identify the potential injected nodes in the graph. By blocking identified injected nodes from interacting with the benign nodes, FINDER prevents the further propagation of misinformation and the spread of adversarial influence throughout the graph. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks, FINDER demonstrates remarkable performance in accurately identifying injected nodes and defending various GIAs.}

	abstract = {With the widespread application of network traffic encryption, traffic identification has become increasingly critical. As the types of encryption protocols continue to grow, identifying encrypted traffic with limited training samples has become more challenging. In recent years, pre-training models have been extensively applied in natural language processing due to their ability to utilize a large amount of unlabeled data effectively. However, when applied to encrypted traffic identification, these methods lack sufficient information extraction from encrypted network traffic, resulting in the loss of some essential features and negatively impacting the recognition performance of such approaches. Therefore, we proposed an encrypted traffic classification model based on a Transformer named FlowBERT. In FlowBERT, the semantic features of the traffic can be learned from two dimensions: payload and packet length sequence in large-scale, unlabeled encrypted traffic scenarios. Length sequences are encoded to extract traffic sequence features efficiently, enabling the model to learn the contextual semantic relationships within the sequences. Simultaneously, the pre-training process is improved by balancing data samples, enhancing the performance of the pre-training model. We validated the performance of this method on both classic encrypted traffic classification datasets and the novel network protocol DoH dataset. We concluded that our approach demonstrates robustness and superior recognition performance compared to similar methods.}

	abstract = {Recent research has brought to light the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples. While several methods have been proposed for generating physical adversarial examples, they often suffer from a critical flaw -conspicuous and easily detectable patterns by humans, limiting their real-world effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an innovative approach termed "dual adversarial camouflage" (DAC) that generates natural adversarial camouflage in the physical world. Our DAC method leverages natural styles to hide attacks effectively. The process involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we learn the style features from style images. Building on this, the second stage optimizes the camouflage obtained in the first stage by minimizing the target detection score, thus significantly enhancing the attack performance. Experiment results show that the adversarial camouflage generated by our method has high naturalness and can effectively deceive object detectors. In practical tests, the attack success rate of our adversarial camouflage in both the digital and physical worlds is impressive, achieving 96.9% and 80% respectively. This showcases the real-world potential and robustness of our DAC method in evading detection.}

To address this challenge, we present DFedXGB, a secure and reliable framework for Federated XGBoost (FedXGB). DFedXGB incorporates an innovative data desensitization scheme to safeguard raw data and model parameters against privacy disclosure. Furthermore, We also designed a secure aggregation algorithm based on XGBoost to mitigate server collusion.

	abstract = {Federated learning has gained significant attention as a privacy-preserving approach for training machine learning models across decentralized devices. However, this distributed learning paradigm is susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly model poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious model updates to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this paper, we investigate the impact of randomness on model poisoning attacks in federated networks, where the server employs two aggregation rules, Krum and Trimmed Mean, randomly in each federated round. We present three distinct adversaries: one targeting Krum throughout the entire learning process, another targeting Trimmed Mean entirely, and a third adversary employing a randomized strategy between Krum and Trimmed Mean for each round. Our objective is to evaluate their performance in reducing the overall accuracy of the federated network. We propose novel techniques to craft poisoned models and explore the efficacy of these attacks by exploiting the aggregation rules. We evaluated our proposed methods on Fashion-MNIST dataset. The experiments reveal the robustness of the federated network against the proposed adversarial scenarios, contributing to a better understanding of the vulnerabilities and defenses in federated learning systems.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserved distributed Machine Learning (ML) technique where multiple clients can contribute to training an ML model without sharing private data. Even though FL offers a certain level of privacy by design, recent works show that FL is vulnerable to numerous privacy attacks. One of the key features of FL is the continuous training of FL models over many cycles through time. Observing changes in FL models over time can lead to inferring information on changes to private and sensitive data used in the FL process. However, this potential leakage of private information is not yet investigated significantly. Therefore, this paper introduces a new form of inference-based privacy attacks called FL Time Inference Attacks (FL-TIA). These attacks can reveal private time-related properties such as the presence or absence of a sensitive feature over time and if it is periodical. We consider two forms of such FL-TIA: i.e. identifying changes in membership of target data records over training rounds and detecting significant events in clients over time by observing differences in FL models. We use the network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a use case to demonstrate the impact of our attack. We propose a continuous updating attack model method for membership variation detection by sustaining the accuracy of the attack. Furthermore, we provide an efficient detection method that can identify model changes using cosine similarity metric and one-shot mapping on shadow model training.}

	abstract = {Fingerprint recognition technology is widely used in various terminal devices and serves as a powerful and effective method for authentication. Existing research relies on centralized training models based on datasets, overlooking the privacy and heterogeneity of the data itself, resulting in the leakage of user information and decreased recognition accuracy. In order to solve the problem of data security and privacy protection, this paper proposes a federated learning-based architecture called FedFR(Federated Learning-Fingerprint Recognition). The parameters from each endpoint are iteratively aggregated through federated learning to improve the performance of the global model under privacy constraints. Moreover, to solve the client-side unfairness issue in traditional federated learning caused by randomly selecting aggregation weights, a client selection method based on reservoir sampling is proposed, increasing the diversity of data distribution. Using the real-world databses, the effectiveness of FedFR is compared and analyzed through simulation experiments. The results show that FedFR exhibits good performance in terms of privacy protection levels, evaluation accuracy, and scalability. Distinct from traditional fingerprint recognition algorithms, FedFR improves the security and scalability of the model from the data source, providing a reference for the application of federated learning in biometric technology.}

	abstract = {As a novel learning paradigm, Federated learning (FL) aims at protecting privacy by avoiding raw data shifting between distributed clients and central servers. However, recent researches demonstrate the vulnerability of FL against gradient-based privacy attacks, in which, gradients intercepted by malicious adversaries may result in data leakage. Current defense methods suffer from performance drops, low privacy guarantees, and high communication costs. Motivated by this, we propose FedRSM, a Representational-Similarity-Based Secured Model Uploading for Federated Learning. FedRSM splits Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into layers, calculates Representational Dissimilarity Vector (RDV), measures the similarity between local RDV and global RDV of each model layer, and constructs secured local model to be uploaded based on Representational Consistency Alteration (RCA). According to the evaluation result, FedRSM can improve testing accuracy by up to 2%, significantly reduce communication costs, and avoid data leakage under different model complexities.}

	abstract = {The industry has widely deployed federated learning (FL) due to its promise to protect clients’ privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks when the participants are compromised. The defense against adversarial attacks is a challenging problem in FL. Moreover, existing defense methods optimize the dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection models separately, leading to a disappointing projection space and low detection accuracy. We propose a deep metric learning-based anomaly detection to project the model gradients into a metric space where the malicious gradients are separated from benign ones. Meanwhile, while existing methods require an auxiliary dataset to train the defense model, the auxiliary dataset is usually unavailable to the server in the FL setting. We propose a self-supervised method to distill the data between the training epochs of our defense model. To handle radical changes in malicious model gradients, we utilize a median-based aggregated gradient filter to discard improper aggregated gradients. We show experimentally that our algorithm has a competitive performance over existing methods under Byzantine attacks and backdoor attacks with various triggers.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that trains models on local devices to preserve data privacy. In FL, evaluating model quality is crucial for detecting malicious clients and improving model accuracy. However, existing methods typically require a representative public testing dataset on the server, which is often unavailable in practical federated learning scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel four-step framework, taking a crowdsourcing approach. The basic idea is to distribute the model to be evaluated as a task to a set of testing clients selected from the original clients pool, who evaluate the model quality using their local datasets. By consolidating these individual evaluations, we obtain the overall model quality. To select a suitable number of testing clients, we propose an exploration-exploitation-based framework. Furthermore, to safeguard against attacks from potential malicious testing clients, we introduce a Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism. This is achieved by comparing correlations of accuracy among the same set of testing clients (who were selected for the aforementioned evaluation task). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields accuracy comparable to methods that rely on a public testing dataset on the server. Moreover, our approach can identify and filter out dishonest testing clients and thereby ensure model quality even in adversarial settings.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across different domains and is used to make critical decisions. However, with profuse and diverse data available, collaboration is indispensable for ML. The traditional centralized ML for collaboration is susceptible to data theft and inference attacks. Federated learning (FL) promises secure collaborative machine learning by moving the model to the data. However, FL faces the challenge of data and model poisoning attacks. This is because FL provides autonomy to the participants. Many Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes exist to identify such poisoned model updates from participants. But, these schemes require raw access to the local model updates, which exposes them to inference attacks. Thus, the existing FL is still insecure to be adopted.This paper proposes the very first generic FL framework, which is both resistant to inference attacks and robust to poisoning attacks. The proposed framework uses hyperdimensional computing (HDC) coupled with FL, called HDFL. HDFL is compatible with different (ML) model architectures and existing Byzantine-robust defenses. HDFL restricts drop in accuracy to 1-2%. HDFL does not add any additional communication overheads and incurs negligible computational time in encoding and decoding raw local model updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of HDFL. HDFL performs secure aggregation and achieves no-attack accuracy, even in the presence of 40% attackers, in just 1.2s per iteration.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables distributed and collaborative learning among multiple participants while protecting their privacy. However, due to its distributed nature, federated learning is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks. These attacks can poison the data or directly modify the model parameters, making the global model performance degrade or even leaving a backdoor. Existing strategies for mitigating Byzantine attacks require a priori information about the number of attackers or require additional validation datasets. However, prior knowledge of the number of Byzantine clients or the collection of representative validation datasets is not always feasible in practice. Moreover, recent research has shown that well-designed attacks can make malicious updates indistinguishable from benign ones by making them highly similar, thus bypassing existing defense methods that rely on these metrics.To tackle these problems, we propose Dynamic Clustering based Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel Byzantine robust FL approach without any additional validation datasets. The main idea behind DCFL is to rigorously constrain the magnitude and direction of local updates through norms and signs. To achieve this, we propose a novel metric that can effectively distinguish malicious updates from benign updates in terms of direction, which can help the server eliminate malicious updates before final aggregation. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DCFL in mitigating various popular Byzantine attacks. Remarkably, the accuracy of the global model learned in the adversarial setting is even close to that of FedAVG under no attack.}

	abstract = {In the traditional centralized Android malware classification framework, privacy concerns arise as it requires collecting users’ app samples containing sensitive information directly. To address this problem, new classification frameworks based on Federated Learning (FL) have emerged for privacy preservation. However, research shows that these frameworks still face risks of indirect information leakage due to adversary inference. Unfortunately, existing research lacks an effective assessment of the extent and location of this leakage risk. To bridge the gap, we propose the FedDLM, which provides a fine-grained assessment of the risk of sensitive information leakage in an FL-based Android malware classifier. FedDLM estimates attackers’ theoretical maximum inference ability from the information theory perspective to gauge the degree of leakage risk in the classifier effectively. It precisely identifies critical positions in the shared gradient where the leakage risk exists by utilizing characteristics of class activation in classifiers. Through extensive experiments on the Androzoo dataset, FedDLM demonstrates its superior effectiveness and precision compared to baseline methods in evaluating the risk of sensitive information leakage. The evaluation results provide valuable insights into information leakage problems in classifiers and targeted privacy protection methods.}

	abstract = {Blockchain, a widely utilized distributed ledger technology, faces the scalability challenge. State sharding has emerged as a promising solution for addressing this challenge. However, conventional state allocation solutions often face two major obstacles: a high ratio of cross-shard transactions and an unbalanced workload distribution, due to their reliance on a simple and fixed assignment of states to shards. The former increases the overall workload on the system, while the latter reduces resource utilization. Both factors significantly impact system performance. Moreover, our key observation is that the collection of smart contract transactions can be represented as a hypergraph network by analyzing their characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes HyperChain, a novel dynamic state sharding protocol that integrates a hypergraph partition algorithm. HyperChain aims to reduce the ratio of cross-shard transactions and balance workload distribution, thereby achieving improved throughput and reduced transaction latency in smart contract blockchain systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed HyperChain exhibits superior performance than other solutions in terms of cross-shard transaction ratio, workload balance, throughput, and transaction latency.}

Blockchain technology has the characteristics of immutability and anonymity, making covert communication more unmonitored and robust. However, it also brings about low communication efficiency. In this article, we adopt the idea of transaction rounds and propose for the first time the construction of HMAC values order (HVO) scheme. Furthermore, we further propose a HMAC values and transaction matrices (HV-TM) scheme to improve communication efficiency. This article is the first to use the gas field to embed data to improve the embedding rate. Use the random numbers generated by the Mersenne Twister algorithm to disrupt the order of addresses to improve the concealment of reused addresses. Experiments have shown that the two schemes have higher communication efficiency and better embedding rate than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Smart contract vulnerability detection is an important security practice aimed at identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities. This detection technique involves using static and dynamic analysis methods to inspect and test contract code, in order to identify code patterns and logical errors that may lead to security vulnerabilities. However, summarizing previous research reveals limitations in terms of scalability and generalizability, which can result in higher rates of false positives and false negatives in detection results. Therefore, we propose a novel smart contract detection framework called TSCSG: Two-Stage Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Combining Semantic Features and Graph Features. In the graph extraction stage, TSCSG utilizes the data flow graph and control flow graph of smart contracts to extract the required contract graph. After processing the graph data, TSCSG employs our proposed RTMP network to extract smart contract graph features. In the semantic extraction stage of contract vulnerabilities, TSCSG utilizes smart contract data propagation chains to extract semantic features of smart contract vulnerabilities, which are then combined with the graph features to obtain the final detection results. Our large-scale empirical study on the EtherScan dataset demonstrates that TSCSG achieves satisfactory results in detecting reentrancy and timestamp vulnerabilities, outperforming 9 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection methods.}

However, DNS is vulnerable to some malicious attacks, including DNS cache poisoning, which redirects users to malicious websites displaying offensive or illegal content. Existing countermeasures often suffer from at least one of the following weakness: weak attack resistance, high overhead, or complex implementation. To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a blockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the forged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution process. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the credibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based incentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation. Importantly, TI-DNS is easy to be adopted as it only requires modifications to the resolver side of current DNS infrastructure. Finally, we develop a prototype and evaluate it against alternative solutions. The result demonstrates that TI-DNS effectively and efficiently solves DNS cache poisoning.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the use of decentralized applications (DApps) has experienced significant growth. However, current testing methods for DApps primarily focus on testing the smart contracts on the blockchain, which are the foundation of DApps, but lack a comprehensive approach to effectively detect off-chain abnormal states. To address this issue, this paper proposes a generic abnormal state detection model based on off-chain transaction data. The model leverages the DApp program code logic to set up test oracles to analyze off-chain transaction data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy in detecting off-chain abnormal states, with a prediction accuracy as high as 96.3%. Furthermore, a comparison with other related vulnerability detection methods shows the advantages of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that can automatically execute and handle cryptocurrency funds. However, over a hundred thousand new smart contracts are deployed every day and inevitably contain vulnerabilities due to programming errors. Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be fixed or changed, leaving funds at risk. To mitigate it, we use deep learning to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. First, we create our own dataset of labeled smart contracts based on opcode sequences, since few smart contract codes and labeled datasets are publicly available. We collect opcode sequences by replaying real-world transactions from the Ethereum Mainnet in our fully synchronized node while we leverage a plugin called "SODA" to label opcode sequences with vulnerability classes. Second, after data collection, we preprocess the data by removing duplicate opcode sequences, normalizing the sequences to the same length, and converting them into vectors. Finally, to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, we train a deep classification model using LSTM neural networks. Our model achieved an average accuracy of 82.63% and an F1-score of 79.74% across seven types of vulnerabilities, which is important for securing funds and logic in smart contracts.}

	abstract = {Blockchain has been envisioned as an anonymous cryptocurrency framework and can be applied in various applications such as e-payment, share economics, and distributed ledger. Although an account is anonymous, privacy in terms of consumption behaviors still imposes leakage risks. For example, an adversary may infer the consumption capability related to an account further by analyzing the history of consumption records. It is thus of critical importance to design a solution to preserve the anonymity of both transaction amount and transaction peer’s identity, which is changeable because the amount must be still authenticated in anonymity. In this paper, we propose a scheme by using Pedersen commitment to anonymize the transaction amount, and together using ring signature to conceal the transaction peer’s identity while maintaining authentication. Especially, we further improve the security of anonymous authentication enabled by ring signature by introducing accountability, which can defend against double-spending attacks by penalization and empower auditability. The extensive performance and security analysis justify the applicability of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Permissioned blockchain frameworks typically employ efficient Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols, making them appealing for the deployment of fast transaction applications among a large number of mutually distrustful participants. However, existing permissioned blockchain frameworks typically use sequential serial workflows to invoke the consensus protocol and execute transactions for the application, resulting in significantly lower performance for these applications when deployed in traditional systems. Therefore, a new permissioned blockchain framework is needed to improve transaction processing efficiency and enhance system performance for practical blockchain technology applications. We propose IHFBF (Improved Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Framework), an improved permissioned blockchain framework that employs a predictive transaction sorting method by selecting a node within the consensus nodes to act as a sorter. This enables parallel execution of the consensus protocol and transactions, resulting in improved overall system performance. However, if the sorter is a malicious node, it can severely impact system performance. To address this, IHFBF uses a view-change method based on a deny-list approach, which effectively guides all participants and replaces or denies malicious participants. Compared to other three fast permissioned blockchain frameworks, IHFBF’s parallel workflow framework reduces latency and exhibits better throughput in the presence of malicious participants, resulting in efficient system performance.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based cloud storage is one of the areas which have been developing rapidly in both academia and industry in recent years. As a key feature to improve the usability of such systems, keyword search is yet missing in existing blockchain-based cloud storage systems due to the encryption of uploaded files. To enable this important feature for blockchain-based cloud storage systems while preserving privacy, blockchain-based Symmetric Searchable Encryption schemes have attracted a lot of research interest. In this research, we pinpoint three important requirements for blockchain-based SSE systems to be practical. The first two requirements are fast query response and low on-chain storage cost. They are the key for a blockchain-based SSE system to be usable and feasible. The third requirement is soundness, which guarantees that dishonest behaviours from both users and service providers can be detected and prevented. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies achieves these properties at the same time. To fill in this gap, we present a novel construction of the blockchain-based SSE system. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation to show that the system achieves all the desired properties.}

	abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an increased demand for contactless payment via IoT devices. However, machine-to-machine (M2M) payment in the IoT has been limited by poor centralized transaction management, given the distributed nature of the IoT, which results in massive communication overhead. Blockchain technology provides a promising solution for M2M payments in the IoT, but the current blockchain-based solutions for contactless payment lack security and scalability. To address this, a new customised Committee Member Auction mechanism has been proposed that is both safe and scalable for resource-constrained IoT devices. This mechanism also reduces the block mining time by integrating the BLAKE hashing algorithm, as opposed to SHA-256. The proposed framework was implemented utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller and RC522 RFID reader to record over 100 transactions each for SHA-256 and Blake. The results obtained validate that Blake hashing algorithm along with Bidirectional blockchain outperforms SHA-256 by reducing 30% of mining time. Besides improved mining efficiency, this scheme is also found to be resistant against Long Range Attack, Double Spend Attack and Eclipse attack. The proposed scheme thus offers a more secure and scalable option for contactless payments in IoT systems.}

	abstract = {In today’s healthcare landscape, emerging technologies serve as crucial foundations, and the integration of blockchain technology into this rapidly evolving digital framework is invaluable. However, the healthcare industry has long struggled with managing the immense and ever-expanding amount of big data electronic health records (EHRs) collected from various sources, including the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, and mobile applications. The storage of all these big data EHRs on the chain creates blockchain bloat, leading to slow transaction speed and high storage costs. More importantly, it incurs security and privacy leakage problems while sharing patients’ sensitive data transparently with a wide range of users in a distributed network. To address these challenges, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving data management system for distributed off-chain networks called PrivOff based on blockchain technology, which stores big EHRs separately in the decentralized file system with efficient access control enforcement and flexible revocation to prevent data breaches. In addition, patients can securely share data without revealing their unique identities to ensure privacy. The evaluation results and security analysis reveal that PrivOff can notably reduce the blockchain storage burden while offering data security, patient privacy, and high data availability.}

	abstract = {Consortium blockchains have been widely used in many industries such as medical care, finance, and so on. The business data on different blockchains are isolated from each other. In order to share the value data, it is necessary to achieve cross-chain access. Existing cross-chain technologies are mainly aimed at public blockchains, while consortium blockchain users hold identity credentials to participate in transactions, which has higher security requirements. In addition, most of the existing consortium blockchains use pluggable cryptography components. If all consortium blockchains participating in the cross-chain are required to be configured with the same cryptosystem, the cost will be too high. To solve the above privacy protection and compatibility issues, we propose a privacy-preserving complete cross-chain authentication scheme and name it ChainPass. Chain-Pass introduces paillier homomorphic encryption and pseudonym technologies, allowing users to use the original cryptosystem to generate public and private keys and participate in cross-chain transactions. At the same time, the user’s pseudonym is updated according to the user’s public key. ChainPass protects users’ privacy while ensuring complete compatibility. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that ChainPass has better security and higher efficiency.}

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has received extensive attention and applied in various fields including health-care, IoT and database systems. Utilizing the decentralization and anti-tampering properties, the blockchain provides potential solutions to achieve verification of data queries, without the assumption of the trusted third parties in traditional data verification studies. However, for kNN queries, a common query type in practical location-based scenarios, few existing solutions can directly support the location-based kNN query processing and result authentication based on blockchain. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based verifiable kNN query processing method. In this method, we first design a novel authenticated data structure called VMR-Tree, which stores the data objects and their neighboring objects in leaf nodes and stores the hash values used for data verification in non-leaf nodes. To verify the results with the minimum size of verification objects (VOs), we design a query result verification method based on the blockchain, in which the client can verify the query results by processing the VOs generated based on the proposed VMR-Tree index and the blockchain. Besides, we further propose an optimization algorithm to reduce the size of VOs. We theoretically analyze the computational complexity and security guarantees of the proposed approaches. We also conducted extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method on the result verification of location-based kNN queries.}

	abstract = {As a new type of task execution mode, crowdsourcing makes use of crowd/worker intelligence to collaboratively complete diverse tasks published by task requesters. Quality assessment is an important stage in crowdsourcing as the publicly recruited workers often vary in reliability when performing tasks. Prior works on crowdsourcing quality assessment either ignore the possible privacy disclosure from the task data or are vulnerable to biased evaluation from malicious evaluators. In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware verifiable crowdsourcing quality assessment scheme UNITE against semi-honest and malicious adversaries. UNITE explores federated learning for privacy-aware training of task models, which serves as an indicator of quality assessment. To prevent attackers from deducing the task data from model gradients, we design a secure model update protocol based on differential privacy and perform it with blockchain smart contracts for trustworthy model aggregation. In the presence of malicious requesters providing incorrect assessments, we exploit Pedersen Commitment to generate evidence, which is recorded on-chain with some metadata for public audit. Detailed privacy analysis demonstrates that our differential privacy scheme satisfies (ε,δ)-local differential privacy. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and deployed the smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate good accuracy and both on-chain and off-chain performance.}

This paper introduces FedJudge, a novel Blockchain-based incentive mechanism that ensures trustworthiness throughout the complete lifecycle of federated learning. To address the issue of evaluating clients’ contributions to the federated model, we adapt the Shapley value algorithm from game theory, resulting in FedShapley. This framework impartially and credibly quantifies the marginal impact of each client on the federated model’s advancement. To ensure objectivity, credibility, and scalability in the FedShapley computation process, we propose FedShapleyPMC—a trusted parallel algorithm harnessing smart contract technology on the blockchain. Furthermore, we implement an automated payment allocation system based on a cryptographic token infrastructure on the blockchain. This implementation guarantees a trustworthy incentive mechanism throughout the federated learning process. Through empirical validation and analysis on authentic datasets, we demonstrate that FedJudge significantly enhances Byzantine fault tolerance while concurrently reducing computation and communication complexities. These advancements are achieved without compromising the robust privacy and security safe-guards.}

	abstract = {A multi-step targeted cyberattack refers to a sophisticated, systematic, and persistent form of attack aiming to compromise the security and integrity of a complex network system. These attacks exhibit spatial and temporal correlations in their execution sequences. However, conventional anomaly detection methods, which often focus on single facets such as network traffic or host behavior, lack the capacity to correlate and validate these steps. To address this deficiency, we introduce HiSec, a cyber threat correlation and discovery framework that leverages dynamic graph modeling and hierarchical graph neural networks. HiSec enhances the modeling of complex network systems and the analysis of spatio-temporal characteristics of multi-step targeted cyberattacks. Specifically, we introduce a novel dynamic graph modeling algorithm that employs overlapping samplers and sliding windows to establish long-term correlations among system activities. Aided by graph attention networks and the Transformer, HiSec uniquely exploits the spatio-temporal correlated edge feature representation, a capability inaccessible to traditional algorithms. Evaluation results reveal that HiSec surpasses existing benchmarks in unsupervised detection, achieving a high degree of accuracy (93.10%) and recall (94.77%). When deployed in our intranet for two rounds of evaluation, HiSec demonstrated remarkable efficiency, taking only 0.15 seconds to model 10,000 system activities occurring within approximately an hour.}

	abstract = {Servers at Supply Chains and othet Cyber-physical systems that receive packets from IoT devices should meet the QoS needs of incoming packets, and protect the system from Cyberattacks. UDP Floods are often included in attacks to overwhelm Supply Chains and the IoT through congestion that paralyzes their ability for timely Attack Detection and Mitigation. Thus this paper proposes an architecture that protects a connected Server using a Smart Quasi-Deterministic Transmission Policy Forwarder at its input. This Forwarder shapes the incoming traffic, sends it to the Server without increasing the overall packet delay, and avoids Server congestion. The relevant theoretical background is reviewed, and measurements during a UDP Flood Attack are provided to compare the Server performance, with and without the Forwarder. It is seen that during a UDP Flood Attack, the Forwarder protects the Server from congestion, allowing it to effectively identify Attack Packets. Congestion at the Forwarder is rapidly eliminated with "drop" commands generated by the Forwarder, or sent by the Server to the Forwarder.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of cryptocurrencies, hierarchical deterministic wallets (HDW) are widely used due to their advantages of easy backup, offline storage, and convenient address management. However, most present HDW schemes are vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks, which pose a tremendous risk to user privacy. As an effective technique for protecting user identity privacy, stealth addresses allow payers to generate a unique address for each transaction in a noninteractive manner. Integrating stealth addresses into HDW can help improve the security of HDW schemes. Based on the above idea, we propose a novel lightweight Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet Supporting Stealth Address (HDWSA) scheme, which not only provides all standard wallet functions but also guarantees the privacy of user identities. Since the proposed scheme is based on the generic elliptic curve cryptosystem, time-consuming pairing operations are avoided, which makes it directly applicable to the current blockchain structure. Finally, the new scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle.}

	abstract = {Different forms of cybercrimes, ranging from email spam and click fraud to the most sophisticated underground economy, have been studied extensively. Fraud and misconduct in legitimate Internet economy, however, have not received sufficient attention, even though potential damages may not be as severe as regular cybercrimes. In this paper, we have performed the first in-depth empirical investigation of fraud and misconduct in legitimate Internet businesses by collecting 6.6 million customer complaints, which were filed over 45 months by 2.7 million customers against 117 thousand merchants on one of the largest customer complaint platforms in the world, along with more than 13 million customer-uploaded images as photographic evidence. We characterized the complaints in terms of merchants, main issues, desired remedy, amount of money involved, customer ratings, and etc. Most importantly, we were able to uncover various fraud and misconduct in different Internet businesses, some of which should have caught law enforcement's attention. The sum of the amount of money involved in these complaints is 5.4 billion US dollars. We also investigated the privacy inference of the images, and found that the image content could disclose an unexpected amount of customers' personal information.}

	abstract = {Autonomous Systems (ASes) communicate via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), forming the Inter-domain routing network, the Internet’s critical infrastructure. Large-scale BGP anomalies over the years have caused serious damage to the global Internet. Effective BGP anomaly detection helps early mitigation of BGP anomalies. Methods based on machine learning, especially graph learning, have achieved remarkable results. However, existing methods based on graph learning have two limitations. One is to use AS communication graphs as the input to the graph neural network model, ignoring the interactions between AS nodes that are physically topologically connected and weakening the perception of anomalous neighbouring nodes; and the other is to use the average features of all nodes as the features of the whole network, smoothing the differences of different nodes, reducing the detection performance while failing to support anomaly tracing. We propose a BGP anomaly detection method based on the spatio-temporal feature representation model for AS (ASSTFR). The ASSTFR model is based on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which automatically extracts spatio-temporal features of AS nodes, rather than the whole network. We use ASSTFR to predict AS features by combining the actual topological connection of AS nodes and the historical information of AS communication features. Thus, the anomaly score of each AS can be generated based on the prediction and observation of AS features. We aggregate AS node anomaly scores based on node importance to detect BGP anomalies, which can distinguish the different contributions of different nodes to the network. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing methods in all metrics. Compared with the best-performing existing method, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of our method are improved by 2.7%, 3.0%, 2.3%, and 2.7% respectively. What’s more, ranking anomaly scores of AS nodes can narrow down the scope of investigation for abnormal origin AS, which helps to locate the root cause of BGP anomalies.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose – DOT – a hybrid analysis approach designed for the detection and classification of malicious files. We have developed both a unified single model and specialized models tailored to various file extensions. Our solutions leverage byte-level content analysis to identify malicious elements within documents, along with n-gram analysis. The uniqueness of DOT lies in its ability to significantly reduce computational overhead. We achieve this by employing Rolling Encoder Hashing, which shortens bytecode sequences, making them compatible with state-of-the-art sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Additionally, we have created a static analysis-based generic model capable of working with a variety of file types, including.doc,.docx,.xls,.xlsx,.pdf, and more. This model can be efficiently deployed in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we have developed specialized models for different file types, which are enhanced versions of the generic architecture, streamlining complex maintenance procedures. Another key innovation and novelty of DOT lies in exactly locating the portion of content in the byte code that could contain malicious code, to help security analysts make the binary code analysis more efficient.We conducted extensive experiments using a dataset recently made available by sources like VirusShare, Contagio, and others, specifically intended for academic research. Our dataset comprises a substantial collection of over 156,000 documents, encompassing both malicious and benign files of the most hazardous types observed in recent years. Our findings reveal impressive results, with a unified single model achieving a 91.43% accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malicious documents. Furthermore, specialized models tailored to specific file types exhibit even higher accuracy rates: 96.13% for.doc files, 97.85% for.docx files, 92.62% for.xls files, 97.02% for.xlsx files, and 94.11% for.pdf files, respectively and with a very low false positive rate.}

	abstract = {Code randomization, aka software diversification, is an effective way to mitigate code-reuse attacks. This mechanism diversifies the target software into heterogeneous variants, making a specific attack chain unfeasible for the transformed variants. Enhancing the heterogeneity of these variants is important for this method to reach its expected security level. Additionally, limiting their execution overhead is necessary to ensure the availability of this protection. However, finding the optimal subset among a large number of diversified variants is computationally difficult. This creates a dilemma in software diversification schema where enhancing heterogeneity and reducing execution overhead are both desired.To ensure a determined code quality control in generating software variants, we propose a guided software diversification mechanism (called GuiDiv). GuiDiv formalizes the iterate-used transformations into a branching process of a tree (called DivTree) and introduces an optimization process (called nodemerging) to guide the diversification. The optimizer evaluates the intermediate compilation results using multi-target evaluation functions in each iteration. This process aims to optimize the contribution of structural heterogeneity from redundant instructions, allowing variants with higher structural dissimilarity and lower overhead to have a higher chance of participating in the next iteration. We developed a proof-of-concept compilation module and used OpenSSL as the performance benchmark. In the evaluations, compared to related schemes, GuiDiv can bring higher control flow dissimilarity in most test cases. Regarding the variant heterogeneity, variants generated by GuiDiv exhibit significantly lower execution overhead.}

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) embodies the emerging fourth revolution, which strongly focuses on Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, big data, and predictive analytics. One of the major challenges associated with this deployment is physical and cyber security, as new emerging devices and technology have paved the way for new threat vectors, and current security measures have a limited endpoint focus and are inadequate to accommodate the broad scale of these emerged complex and distributed IIoT systems. To create secure and safe IoT systems, a comprehensive risk assessment that can span the entire physical and cyber stack of IIoT systems is needed. In this article, we investigate the current risk assessment frameworks, discuss their strengths and challenges, and show that current frameworks do not sufficiently work for IIoT deployments. We subsequently present a novel security taxonomy to supplement and address existing assessment frameworks' challenges. We validate this proposed taxonomy with extensive recent research literature.}

	abstract = {In recent years, encrypted DNS such as DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) has gained significant traction as privacy-preserving alternative to conventional DNS. While several studies have measured the performance of encrypted DNS relative to conventional DNS, they are only performed over IPv4, little has been done to understand their status over IPv6. Besides, previous studies can not obtain the absolute query latency due to lack of control over vantage points.This paper performs by far the fist end-to-end performance measurements on encrypted DNS over IPv6. By analyzing measurement results, we have gained several insights. In general, the quality of service for encrypted DNS is satisfying. Over IPv6, encrypted DNS performance varies across resolvers, and is affected by the location issuing DNS queries, the type of encrypted DNS protocol used and the latency to resolvers. Compared with IPv4, the performance of encrypted DNS of different resolvers over IPv6 is improved to some extent. In addition, we also find other problems such as the quality of service of resolver Ahadns is significantly low both over IPv6 and IPv4, as well as the performance of encrypted DNS for resolver Alidns significantly deteriorates when switching from IPv4 to IPv6. Based on our observations, we provide recommendations and discuss situations in which switching to IPv6 may be beneficial. We hope that our tools developed for performing measurements can help people in different regions to choose to the right recursive resolver and network environment, and that our findings can contribute to improve IPv6 Internet infrastructure and inform continuing encrypted DNS deployment over IPv6.}

	abstract = {The democratization of artificial intelligence has made substantial progress by leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers across domains to train customized models to meet their specific needs. Given the confidentiality and significance of cybersecurity, obtaining private and localized LLMs is imperative. However, general LLMs are not designed to cater specifically to this field, their general knowledge often falls short when addressing such specialized problems. In this paper, we categorize the domain instructions based on cybersecurity knowledge to guide the construction of high-quality instructions and conversations, ultimately enhancing the specialized capabilities of LLMs. The resulting fine-tuned LLMs, collectively termed HackMentor, are evaluated using WinRate, EloRating, and ZenoEval methods along with other popular LLMs. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant performance improvements, surpassing the native LLMs by 10-25% when aligned with cybersecurity prompts. More, HackMentor exhibits comparable conversational quality to ChatGPT, while providing more concise and humanlike responses. This study demonstrates the efficacy of HackMentor in augmenting LLMs for cybersecurity requirements, paving the way for localized LLMs that meet specialized needs without compromising general capabilities.}

	abstract = {Network protocol specification is essential in analyzing and evaluating network functionality, performance, and security. However, increasing private protocols become a hindrance to these features. The existing works study how to extract protocol keyword fields rather than infer the semantics of the fields, such as the length field, which can indicate the length associated with a message and is fundamental for deep analysis of network protocols. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric and unsupervised method, ROSE, to extract the length field of unknown binary network protocols from static traces. It segments the fields from the raw network trace and gets the inferred length of a subset of messages by clustering similar fields with k-means. Then, it generates candidate fields using n-gram and builds a multidimensional equation based on the length of the clustered messages and the candidate length fields. Finally, ROSE extracts the inferred length fields through linear regression. As far as we know, it is the first study on extracting length field from the static trace. The evaluation experiments using raw network traces exhibit high precision and recall in extracting the length field or identifying protocols without the length field.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a task-oriented semantic communication system for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification, called ECG-SC-DARTS. Based on deep learning, this system adopts the differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) to automatically design the neural architecture of the semantic encoder under various channels. This paper improves the performance of the original DARTS by introducing a new recurrent neural network (RNN) cell with residual structure and a noise adding scheme for skip-connections. The RNN cell enhances the temporal semantic information extraction ability while the added noise reduces the risk of performance collapse caused by skip-connections. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGSC-DARTS generates appropriate neural architectures for the semantic encoder under AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician channels and these architectures outperform a number of baseline models, such as the original DARTS, fully convolutional network, multi-layer perception, and ResNet, regarding F1-score. Moreover, ECGSC-DARTS is more reliable than the traditional communication system in harsh channel environment.}

	abstract = {Pattern matching is a crucial technique for network traffic detection applications. As a fundamental computation model used by pattern matching, the finite state automata execute sequential matching due to the state dependence among transitions. Meanwhile, most services tend to compress their data to improve transmission or storage efficiency. The increased compressed data challenges the straightforward method of matching the whole decompressed data and incurs data dependence among the compression encodings. The related approaches either leverage techniques to break the state dependence of matching uncompressed data or accelerate matching compressed data in a single-threaded manner without considering the state and data dependence. None of them can perform parallel matching over compressed data. This paper provides PETALS, a parallel pattern matching method over Brotli compressed network traffic. PETALS partitions the original compressed traffic into fixed- length blocks for parallel matching and patches the broken compression encodings crossing blocks to break the data dependence. Then, it merges the compressed traffic matching method into path fusion, an enumerative parallelization of finite state automata, to present parallel matching over compressed traffic. Evaluation using real-world network traffic and regular expressions shows that PETALS can raise the speedup from 1.53x to 3.53x of the state-of-the-art parallelization schemes on a 56-cores machine.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, edge computing has become part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that plays a vital role in developing smart applications. As the usage of IoT devices significantly increases, at the same time, network edge infrastructure faces several security challenges. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most severe threats to edge-cloud services. Therefore, designing a robust mitigating system is unavoidable for the network edge, and it must be able to recognize emerging attacks. This work proposes an anomaly-based DDoS detection approach that combines information-theoretic metrics and multivariate correlation analysis. The information-theoretic metric captures the randomness and complex nature of traffic behaviour. Similarly, multivariate correlation analysis identifies the relationship among traffic features. Combining information metrics and correlation analysis, we generate normal and attack traffic profiles for the training base to estimate density. The generated profiles build on the metrics including Triangle Area Mapping (TAM) with correlation analysis, Renyi’s divergence, covariance, mean, and standard deviation, which enhances the detection performance of the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using testbed and benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 0.17% and 2.32%, and 0.50% higher accuracy compared to the baseline approaches on the testbed, UNSW and CIC-DDoS datasets, respectively.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the requirement for creating novel frameworks to monitor and identify cyberattacks in Connected Vehicles (CVs). The health of the sensors in CVs becomes crucial when performance predictions and communication-related errors can compromise the resilience of the sensory network. To meet the evolving demands of connected vehicle (CV) systems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must be regularly updated and tailored as powerful monitoring entities. To equip cloud-tied operators with the ability to comprehend unusual sensor data originating from vehicles at the cloud level, we designed an innovative Real-time Cloud-based Adversarial IDS called RCA-IDS. This system exclusively focuses on detecting and explaining instances of sensor data manipulation caused by poisoning attacks. Two attack mechanisms were created utilizing random-based and silhouette-based clustering methods. Subsequently, two defence mechanisms based on multi-layer neural network-type deep learning were proposed to counter these attacks. The newly introduced RCA-IDS demonstrates a minimum accuracy of 90% in detecting cyberattacks.}

	abstract = {The privacy protection capabilities of open source proxy software (OSPS) while browsing the Internet have sparked great interest from both industry and academia, bringing forth pressing security concerns. Currently, using artificial intelligence for traffic identification is the most promising direction. Due to the wide variety and rich configuration of OSPS, it is not feasible to train models for all tasks and deploy them on the same network device. It is a novel idea to improve efficiency by leveraging multi-task learning. However, the related studies still have three shortcomings. First, improving the performance of the main task through auxiliary tasks does not apply to equally important OSPS identification tasks. Second, the model’s ability to characterize traffic is weak, resulting in performance gaps between different tasks. Finally, the influence of task difficulty on convergence speed is ignored, which is easy to cause overfitting and underfitting. Aiming at the shortcomings, we propose Cerberus, an OSPS traffic identification scheme based on multi-task learning. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in three aspects. Firstly, a high-quality dataset is constructed through traffic collection, and three OSPS traffic identification tasks are defined on it. Secondly, an identification model is designed by optimizing the ability to characterize traffic and balancing the convergence speed of multiple tasks. Finally, Cerberus is verified through comparative experiments. Its classification performance is better than both single-task and multi-task solutions. Besides, Cerberus runs fast and consumes few resources, making it suitable for deployment on network devices.}

	abstract = {With the increasing threats of network tracking and information leakage, privacy protection has become a widely concern in the field of network security. As an important means of protecting the privacy of network users, anti-tracking networks have gradually become one of the important research directions. However, the existing topology structures of anti-tracking networks still have problems such as intra-domain aggregation and key nodes, which are vulnerable to attack, tracking and destruction, and can not meet the privacy requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a topology construction method based on cross-domain decentralized gravity model (CDTC). Firstly, the model comprehensively considers the local neighbor information, the location information of nodes, and the path information between nodes to calculate the node attraction. Secondly, each node determines its link status with other nodes through the model by ranking its local nodes, achieving optimization of the network topology. Finally, experiments on typical network structures and open network datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed model has better decentralization, cross-domain, and anti-tracking performance.}

	abstract = {Identifying persons based on their interaction with a door handle has been an active research field in the past years and related work presented promising results. In this context, they instrumented door handles with sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, or touch and extracted features from complete opening interactions that include pushing down the handle, opening the door, entering the room, and releasing the handle. This work extends existing research with an evaluation whether already the initial door handle’s push-down-phase (PDP) provides sufficient data for behavior-based authentication. For that, recorDOOR was built, a door handle prototype equipped with a camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, four touch stripes, and three ultrasonic distance sensors. We recorded 768 door interactions from eight participants (48 per hand) using recorDOOR, manually labeled the PDP’s start and end, and when the door started moving using our camera stream. We are the first that recorded both hands and also simulated four real-life door opening scenarios including a novel opening careful scenario when standing in front of a door. Our quantitative analysis of the extracted PDPs shows that there is a high variance between PDP durations from less than 40 milliseconds to more than a second and that there are notable differences between left and right hand while opening independent of the scenario. Furthermore, over 95% of our participants started moving the door before the handle was pushed down to its maximum that further shortens the time for a user identification. Based on 235 extracted features and nested 5-fold cross-validation, a Gradient Boosting Classifier performed best and achieved a mean accuracy of 87.92% in an identification scenario for the overall PDP and 82.41% if only considering the PDP before the door is already moved.}

	abstract = {To timely respond to cyber threats related to a specific IT infrastructure called fine-grained (e.g., Windows or Linux), security analysts need to require timely and comprehensive threat information. Twitter, as a vital source of real-time threat information, provides abundant but overwhelming information due to the increased data sources. Automatically mining and summarizing fine-grained threat information from Twitter can help security analysts maintain the infrastructure’s security. Most existing studies focus on classification, which carries less threat information. Some works use clustering based on text similarity relying on the embedding of text obtained from pre-trained models, which cannot be applied to short text, resulting in noisy clusters. Several works build topic models. However, the incoherent topic keywords are difficult to understand and analyze. To overcome these challenges, we design a FineCTI framework to mine the threat information related to the specific infrastructure on Twitter and generate a detailed threat information summary that is machine-readable and human-readable, efficiently reducing information overload. FineCTI optimizes the feature extraction part based on the named entity recognition model and performs clustering based on features extracted, thus effectively reducing the influence of sparsity of tweets on the clustering result and with the V-measure score improved by 7%. The cluster analysis results show that we can mine the fine-grained threats up to 15 days before the official disclosure date.}

	abstract = {Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) are used to monitor the internals of target systems. It is essentially difficult to execute HIDS securely inside target systems. For example, it is not guaranteed that HIDS can obtain correct information from compromised systems. If HIDS is tampered with by intruders, it would be easily disabled. So far, various techniques have been proposed to securely execute HIDS using the security features of processors, e.g., System Management Mode (SMM) and SGX in Intel processors. However, strongly secure HIDS sacrifices its manageability, whereas manageable HIDS is less secure. In practice, it is important to achieve not only the security but also the manageability of HIDS. This paper proposes SSdetector for achieving both security and manageability by combining SGX and SMM. SSdetector securely runs HIDS inside an SGX enclave, which is a protected region inside an SGX application. Since HIDS is developed as an SGX application, the management of HIDS is easier. To securely obtain system information in memory, in-enclave HIDS invokes the SMM monitor running in an isolated execution environment created by BIOS. SSdetector protects information passed between in-enclave HIDS and the SMM monitor by encryption and integrity checking. We have implemented SSdetector in UEFI BIOS and examined the performance of HIDS collecting system information necessary for the proc filesystem.}

	abstract = {Digital rights management (DRM) solutions aim to prevent the copying or distribution of copyrighted material. On mobile devices, a variety of DRM technologies have become widely deployed. However, a detailed security study comparing their internal workings, and their strengths and weaknesses, remains missing in the existing literature. In this paper, we present the first detailed security analysis of mobile DRM systems, addressing the modern paradigm of cloud-based content delivery followed by major platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. We extensively analyse the security of three widely used DRM solutions—Google Widevine, Apple FairPlay, and Microsoft PlayReady—deployed on billions of devices worldwide. We then consolidate their features and capabilities, deriving common features and security properties for their evaluation. Furthermore, we identify some design-level shortcomings that render them vulnerable to emerging attacks within the state of the art, including micro-architectural side-channel vulnerabilities and an absence of post-quantum security. Lastly, we propose mitigations and suggest future directions of research.}

	abstract = {The finite energy supply available for computation and communication is one of the major shortcomings in IoT/sensor networks. To circumvent this issue, energy harvesting has been proposed to enable embedded devices to mitigate their dependency on traditional battery-driven power sources. However, energy supply due to energy harvesting often varies, leading to nodes crashing due to energy exhaustion, with the application(s) losing their state. Efficient state checkpointing in non-volatile memory (NVM) has been proposed to enable forward progress, albeit at the expense of significant overheads (viz., energy and time). This work is based on the observation that, as the network evolves, IoT applications adapt/refresh to ensure they have up-to-date state of information, thereby reducing the need for checkpointing. However, little is known about (i) whether checkpointing is actually needed for any application, (ii) if needed, what to checkpoint for a given application and (iii) when checkpointing is needed in an application. In this paper, we address the first two problems and make the following novel contributions: (i) we formalise a variant of the checkpointing problem for IoT networks and show that it is NP-complete, (ii) we introduce a theory of state checkpointing and develop two types of checkpointing: (a) local checkpointing and (b) network checkpointing, (iii) we show that there is no general checkpointing strategy for the network-based application that will improve efficiency and (iv) we briefly survey related works and show that most if not all, works on checkpointing of IoT-based applications that lead to increased efficiency have focused on node-centric (i.e., local) programs. We run experiments on an actual testbed to confirm our expectations, and our results show that checkpointing can actually have a negative impact on applications when wrongly used. Thus, compared to existing works, we make major gains: No checkpointing is needed for network-based applications.}

	abstract = {There has been a significant spike in cyber attacks with serious economic, security, and privacy concerns recently. The effectiveness of older NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems) has been diminishing as cyber attacks become more sophisticated and complex. Majority of research focuses on detecting and classifying attacks, with limited work attempting to forecast the number of cyber attack. Recent works propose using statistical, machine learning, or deep learning models to forecast cyber attacks, but they do not take advantage of the correlation that exists among different devices present in a network. We proposed a model, PANGA that employs a combination of Principal Neighborhood Aggregation(PNA), Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), and attention layers to effectively capture and leverage spatiotemporal dependencies. It achieves a mean square error of 0.027 and a coefficient of determination of 0.87 on well known CIDDS-001 dataset. Additionally, we performed perturbation analysis by adding gaussian noises to the test data to validate the robustness of the model. The performance of the proposed model remains largely unaffected as long as the standard deviation of the noise was kept below 0.25.}

	abstract = {With the emergence of various applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the cooperative communication among vehicles has become increasingly important to provide transportation data services. However, vehicles with selfish behaviors rarely provide high-performance communication services to others, resulting in a low packet delivery ratio and a high end-to-end delay. It is extremely challenging to substantially alleviate the influence of selfish vehicles in vehicular networks, because of the network topology and unstable communication qualities. To address the above problems, the Social similarity and Reputation Based Routing (SRBR) is proposed, considering social relationships, vehicle behaviors, and transmission capacity. The social similarity can improve network performance by leveraging the social relationships of vehicles, while reputation mechanisms can effectively defend against selfish vehicles’ attacks. Additionally, to integrate the above two-dimensional metrics, fuzzy logic is employed. Furthermore, extensive results show SRBR outperforms other baseline schemes in terms of delivery ratio, average latency, and overhead ratio.}

	abstract = {Successful information propagation from source to destination in Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) can be hampered by the presence of neighbouring attacker nodes causing unwanted packet dropping. Potential attackers change their behaviour over time and remain undetected due to the adhoc nature of VANET. Capturing the dynamic attacker behaviour and updating the corresponding neighbourhood information without compromising the quality of service requirements is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based neighbour selection framework for VANET with an adaptive trust management system to capture the behavioural changes of potential attackers and to dynamically update the neighbourhood information. In contrast to existing works, we consider trust and link-life time in unison as neighbour selection criteria to achieve trustworthy communication. Our adaptive trust model takes into account the social relationship, time and confidence in trust observation to avoid four types of attackers. To update the neighbourhood information, our framework sets the learning rate of the RL agent according to the velocities of the neighbour nodes to improve the model’s adaptability to network topology changes. Results demonstrate that our method can take less number of hops to the destination for large network sizes while can response is up to 54% faster compared to a baseline method. Also, the proposed model can outperform the other baseline method by reducing the packet dropping rate up to 57% caused by the attacker.}

	abstract = {Edge cloud resources, just as many other computing resources, are prone to both performance and security anomalies due to their decentralized nature and real-time requirements for processing of data. Their behaviour initially observed as anomalous may, however, in many cases be rather generic and hard to detect. To be able to address such anomalies, it is instrumental to determine whether the anomaly is a "Security" threat or only a "Performance" concern. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an anomaly detection model capable of distinguishing between security and performance anomalies. The model is based on sequential modeling and Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM), which leverage historical information and dependencies between previous predictions to classify future anomalies accurately. The evaluation of our proposed model shows its superior performance on our testbed and benchmark datasets. Accordingly, the model achieves an average 5%, and 3% higher F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods in binary and multi-label anomaly detection cases, respectively. Moreover, our testing time analysis demonstrates the ability of the proposed model in early detection of such anomalies on the edge cloud.}

	abstract = {Synchronization plays a crucial role in computer systems, providing support for system security, data consistency, and coordination. It contributes to the establishment and application of trust, security, and dependability in distributed systems and concurrent computing to a significant extent. This article makes innovative contributions in the field of synchronic distance in Petri net. We provide refined definitions for the hierarchical classification of synchronic levels in Petri net, proposing the concepts of absolute synchronization, strong synchronization, and extended synchronization based on different conditions. Furthermore, we propose an innovative method for calculating synchronic distance. This method can automate the calculation of synchronic distance between any two transitions using computer computation, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced errors. This novel approach provides an effective tool for system security and trustworthy modeling, as accurate synchronic distance calculations allow for better evaluation of synchronic distance between different transitions, leading to the identification of potential security vulnerabilities and design flaws, thereby enhancing the credibility of decision-making and promoting the reliability of models and analysis results. To validate the proposed method, we introduce a specific example of a Petri net with concurrency, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm through analysis of this example. Our work extends the research on Petri net synchronic distance, further advancing the understanding and exploration of this field.}

	abstract = {In traffic-based tracking scenes, acknowledging category diversity and visual field motion is pivotal. This leads tracking models to prioritize multi-category feature learning, motion analysis, and extended time series modeling rather than singularly focusing on attribute acquisition and background modeling. With this goal in mind, we construct a tracking model by integrating re-identification branches into a lightweight detection model. Simultaneously, we establish an inter-frame spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Feature Transfer Module. This mechanism aligns the current frame features with the corresponding local features of the previous frame, which can bolster feature representation and downstream task performance. Experimental results on the traffic dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in addressing challenges such as occlusion and deformation within traffic scenes. The proposed method attains a significant 31.5 MOTA and 35.7 AP on the BDD100K dataset with random data selection.}

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing reliance on digital networks for various aspects of modern life, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Intrusion Detection Systems play a crucial role in ensuring network security, actively identifying and mitigating malicious behaviours. However, the relentless advancement of cyber-threats has rendered traditional/classical approaches insufficient in addressing the sophistication and complexity of attacks. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage intrusion detection system inspired by a simplified version of the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain to detect advanced multi-step attacks. The proposed approach consists of three models, each responsible for detecting a group of attacks with common characteristics. The detection outcome of the first two stages is used to conduct a feasibility study on the possibility of predicting attacks in the third stage. Using the ToN IoT dataset, we achieved an average of 94% F1-Score among different stages, outperforming the benchmark approaches based on Random-forest model. Finally, we comment on the feasibility of this approach to be integrated in a real-world system and propose various possible future work.}

	abstract = {As one of the most challenging threats in cyberspace, insider threats frequently lead to substantial losses for enterprises. Recently, there are many studies focus on user behavior analysis for insider threats detection. However, they ignore the underlying causes of insider threats and the implicit relationships between users, which is more critical for discover the insider threats. To address this gap, we propose the novel ITDE model in this paper, which applies a graph neural network approach based on two-layer attention. The core idea is to abstracting user features and potential relationships as heterogeneous graphs based on an analysis of user behavior and the causes of insider threats. Futhermore, we employ node-level attention and semantic-level attention to capture the complex graph structure information and generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors. Finally, we use a cross-entropy loss function to implement insider threat detection. We verify the effectiveness of our model on the CERT r4.2 dataset and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in insider threat detection.}

	abstract = {Universal lesion detection using computerised tomography (CT) scans is a critical computer-aided diagnosis measure in clinical diagnosis. One of the key issues during the diagnosis is to identify the correlations between sequential slices to improve the feature representation of CT scans. In the process of fusing slice features containing temporal correlations, the correlation between the contextual slices in the channel dimension and the target slices is closely related to the spatial distance in practice. However, convolutional fusion approaches commonly ignore that features of different distances have unequal weights. To tackle this issue, we present a temporal correlation weighted fusion lesion detection network, called TCW-Net. Specifically, for the slices in the channel dimension, we develop a weighted feature fusion module to adjust the more discriminative features using learned weights. Then, we adapt a spatial offset attention mechanism that allows the detection network to pay more attention to the lesion’s slight spatial offset and thus improve the model’s capacity for distinguishing between different lesion features. Extensive experiments carried out on the DeepLesion dataset show that the proposed algorithm has superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection within dynamic networks holds significant relevance in fields such as cybersecurity, e-commerce, and social media. Recent methods employing deep learning concentrate on alterations in node-dependent substructures within dynamic networks, yielding superior outcomes compared to graph embedding-based techniques. Nevertheless, these methods grapple with two primary problems in dynamic network anomaly detection: the disruption caused by relevant neighbors during node sampling and the inadequate integration of spatio-temporal information. To address these issues, we propose a framework ESEAD for anomaly edge detection in dynamic networks in this paper. This proposed framework devises a random walk-based node sampling strategy, selecting nodes intimately associated with the edge under scrutiny, and designs an encoder model utilizing a multi-headed attention mechanism to learn the spatio-temporal features of the edge neighborhood. Subsequently, these domain-specific spatio-temporal features are fed into an anomaly discriminator for anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed ESEAD framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across five real-world datasets.}

	abstract = {The domain name features used in the existing domain name detection methods about domain generation algorithm (DGA) are generally easy to evade, which results in some common DGA domain name detection methods failing to effectively detect the DGA domain name. To solve the issues, we propose a DGA domain name detection method based on two-stage feature reinforcement. Firstly, we encode the domain name to obtain the domain name word vector. Secondly, the slice pyramid network (SPN) is used to process the word vector to extract the domain name feature. Thirdly, we reinforce the domain name feature by using the two-stage reinforcement method we proposed. The two-stage reinforcement method reinforces the domain name feature by adding domain name semantic information to the extracted features and reducing feature information redundancy to improve the stability of the domain name feature, meanwhile, we convert the reinforced domain name feature to the primary capsules to reduce feature loss. Finally, we use the dynamic routing algorithm to process the primary capsules to generate digital capsules, and then the digital capsules are used to detect domain names. Experimental results on domain name detection and domain name family classification both show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method has better detection performances.}

	abstract = {Shilling attack is the behavior of malicious users to elevate or suppress ratings in collaborative filtering recommendation system, which can destroy the balance of recommendation and disrupt the order of competition. In previous studies, shilling attack detection techniques can be divided into three categories according to the labeling scale of samples: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. The semi-supervised method is better at using a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples to improve the detection efficiency. However, in practice, it is found that the existing semi-supervised methods perform poorly in the face of high-knowledge shilling attacks such as PUA and PIA, and the generalization ability is significantly reduced when the proportion of labeled data becomes smaller. Therefore, this paper proposes a semi-supervised detection method GA-CoF. Different from the existing divergent semi-supervisors, the proposed method regards the solution set of unlabeled samples as gene sequences, the error rate as the fitness function, and the aggregation degree as the penalty term. In the experiments, we extract the user behavior characteristics of standard shilling attacks, and compare our method with four representative shilling attack detection algorithms on two datasets, MovieLens-25M and Amazon-5Cores. The results show that our method can maintain high F1 score and is not sensitive to the attack scale when facing high-knowledge shilling attacks, and performs well on real datasets. The proposed method has good module plugging ability and expansion prospects.}

	abstract = {The TLS encryption protocol plays a vital role in securing data transmission, but it also presents challenges for payload-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Existing methods utilize statistical characteristics of side-channel features, such as the mean packet length, to identify encrypted traffic. However, packet lengths are constrained by the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of the TCP protocol. This constraint causes the length-varied sequence to be encapsulated into segments of equal length, resulting in information loss. Moreover, flow-level statistical features are vulnerable to interference from noisy packets, making it challenging to detect malicious traffic injected with benign packets effectively. In this paper, we propose an encrypted traffic detection model based on Record length and frEquency Domain Analysis (REDA). First, we reconstruct the TLS Record Length Sequence (TRLS), which is a length-varied sequence, to capture differences in traffic content during transmission. Second, we employ the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract frequency domain features of the TRLS, which are resistant to attacker interference. Finally, an improved One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm is devised for the unsupervised detection of malicious traffic, enabling the identification of unknown attacks. Experiments show that REDA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy by 2.44%.}

	abstract = {With the evolution of attack tactics, cyber-attacks are presenting a sophisticated trend. The multi-step attack has become the mainstream attack form, where adversaries implement multiple attack steps to achieve their goals, which poses server challenges to attack detection. Traditional research mainly concentrates on how a particular attack step is exploited but fails to identify the whole attack activity automatically. Manual analysis is required to correlate multiple steps and determine the fine-grained type of attack activities, which is a heavy workload. In addition, the high error rate of alerts results in a negative impact on attack-activity detection performance.To address these challenges, we propose a framework, LActDet, to automatically identify attack activities from the raw alerts end-to-end. Firstly, it utilizes a document-embedding method to vectorize attack-event descriptions. Second, a seq2seq model is implemented to embed the attack-event sequence into the attack-phase sequence to represent the framework of attack activity, aiming at improving the fault tolerance for error alerts. In the end, we propose a temporal-sequence-based classifier to identify attack activities. Our experimental results demonstrate that LActDet achieves higher detection accuracy, lower artificial dependence, and less system overhead.}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection of key performance indicators (KPIs), e.g., CPU load, network usage, is crucial for system behavior monitoring. In recent years, several anomaly detection approaches have been proposed. However, detecting anomalies of KPIs remains challenging because of the stochastic nature and complex temporal dependence of multivariate time series. Additionally, the presence of noise and the unavailability of labeled data in large-scale datasets limit the effectiveness of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose IAD-Net, an interpretable anomaly detection method with Dual Gated Residual Fusion Networks. The main idea is to model the inter-metric and temporal dependencies simultaneously by using gated residual blocks and two-stream fusion. Additionally, we utilize Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to extract long-term global trend patterns of an input sequence. Finally, both the forecasting-based model and the reconstruction-based model are combined in order to focus on single-timestamp predictions and latent representations of time series. Extensive experiments on real-world data show that IAD-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches according to F1-score. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our method in anomaly interpretation.}

	abstract = {Malicious traffic detection is a pivotal component in ensuring network security. Currently, deep learning-based malicious traffic detection methods have become mainstream. However, these studies lack comprehensive attention to the structural features of traffic and the time delay information between data packets. To address these issues, we propose a new malicious traffic detection model MTD-RTPE, which is built upon relative time-delay positional encoding and multi-head self-attention mechanisms. By analyzing the hierarchical structure of traffic, we integrated certain natural language processing (NLP) techniques into our method. We designed a relative time-delay positional encoding module to embed the relative time delay information between traffic data packets into the positional encoding. Leveraging multi-head self-attention, we extracted spatio-temporal features, which significantly enhanced our model’s ability to detect malicious traffic and improved its generalization capability. Based on experiments conducted on the USTC-TFC2016, CTU-Malware&Normal, and ISOT public datasets, the proposed model demonstrates commendable performance in terms of accuracy and handling imbalanced dataset testing.}

This movement generates concerns regarding trust between the parties involved in these aspects. Nevertheless, trust is a broad topic and thus it is challenging to define a unified mechanism for evaluating trust in communication networks. This article focuses on presenting a general model of trust in communication networks that is flexible enough to be implemented by a wide range of use cases. The model is based on the concept of trust functions, a type of relationship used to evaluate trust. Trust functions are evaluated between two subjects, based on the action that is about to take place and the objects being affected by that action. We use this model to describe a use case of Trust Enhanced Networking and present a discussion regarding trust in communication networks and future challenges.}

	abstract = {Humans constantly interact with computing devices. Many times, these interactions involve sensitive information and/or sensitive commands, leading to the need for trusted paths between humans and computers. For computer-to-computer interactions, secure communication is not an issue thanks to cryptographic protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the IP Security Protocol (IPSec). However, the same does not yet apply to interactions between humans and computers due to the inability of humans to execute non-trivial cryptographic algorithms. This results in interactions that are vulnerable to shoulder surfing, man-in-the-browser malware, and web page spoofing, among other attacks. This consequently puts at risk the use of sensitive services in uncontrolled environments.We present TrustGlass, a scheme that uses augmented reality smart glasses to solve this security problem. TrustGlass uses such glasses to extend human capabilities, to execute the cryptographic algorithms needed to establish a trusted path between the user and the trusted service, which can be executed in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). With this approach, we can guarantee that only the user equipped with the glasses is capable of interacting with the service. We implemented TrustGlass using commercial smart glasses and show experimental performance and usability results.}

	abstract = {To promote honest service provision in multi-agent systems, a Computational Trustworthiness and Rating scheme collects service ratings and computes agents' trustworthiness levels (TLs). Studies of existing schemes fail to reflect closed-loop dynamics of TLs arising from the mutual influence of agents' behavior and TLs, and to capture relevant properties. Recent simulative and analytical models produce results tied to a particular attack scenario, or restricted to small-size systems or simplistic agent behavior. We analyze a class of parameterized skimp and slander attacks in a challenging setting featuring agents' virtual anonymity, collusion, and blind, i.e., TL-insensitive selection of service providers, as well as unpredictable service availability and receptivity. We derive closed-loop Markovian TL dynamics and their mean-value approximation to analytically characterize agents' steady-state TLs, and find a systematic defense against skimp and slander.}

	abstract = {Recently, a series of vulnerabilities occurred to divulge or forge single sign-on tickets, such as the famous SolarWinds incident Once malicious attackers obtain fraudulent tickets, they can pry into user privacy as well as compromise the system by impersonating the victim user. Inspired by certificate transparency, a ticket transparency (TT) framework for detecting fraudulent tickets is proposed. However, it suffers from inefficiency and potential failure. In this paper, we further propose an enhanced ticket transparency (eTT) scheme, which ensures that all fraudulent tickets can be detected efficiently through a novel dual-backup structure to store ticket entries in the public log. Meanwhile, we design specific calculations for pairwise pseudonymous identifiers (PPIDs), to support fraudulent-detection towards tickets in which user identifiers are pseudonyms. We implemented the prototype system, and the experimental evaluation shows that eTT framework introduces acceptable overheads in the sign-on process.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, a substantial amount of sensitive user data is stored on the cloud. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environments, the provider is fully trusted, making it essential to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of cloud applications and data. As a novel security technology, confidential computing strives to decrease reliance on cloud providers by delivering the smallest Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and providing enhanced end-to-end data protection capabilities within the cloud environment.This paper proposes an efficient scheme for remote attestation and monitoring the integrity of confidential computing platforms based on a hardware root of trust, addressing the load-time and run-time trust problems of cluster nodes in a confidential cloud environment. The scheme uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as the identity of hardware root of trust to achieve secure registration and attestation. Additionally, the scheme ensures load-time trust by binding the boot state to PCRs through TPM2.0 policy authorization mechanism. To ensure secure transmission of sensitive data between nodes, trusted channels are established for the remote attestation with key agreements. Runtime integrity is ensured by periodically attesting nodes with the EpochID-based integrity monitoring. This paper also analyzes the security of the proposed scheme. We implement the prototype to proves the efficiency and feasibility based on TPM2 and x86 confidential platform. It demonstrate measurement and attestation logs of cluster nodes in our scheme for remote attestation and integrity monitoring using TPM2.0. Compared with the representative solution Keylime, the integrity monitoring performance has improved by 71.4% without reducing security. Furthermore, it exhibits lower network communication latency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework and an architecture that aim to enable and manage trust in supply chains. Our architecture addresses the authenticity and integrity of devices and processes within heterogeneous system landscapes. We identify and discuss the current challenges in digital supply chains and lay out security, privacy, and interoperability requirements that must be met for successful implementation. We hypothesize that the overall perception of trust in a supply chain depends on the trustworthiness of all digital systems involved, including hardware, software, and information flow. Our proposed architecture helps enhance trustworthiness based on verifiable, indisputable, and believable digital evidence for devices and processes in supply chains, including the entire hardware and software lifecycles. We actively advocate for a mixed landscape of centralized and decentralized solutions for the storage of evidence and trust information. This can include traditional centralized databases and distributed ledger technologies. We discuss the auditability and accountability of digital evidence using trust-enabling technologies, and present a preliminary proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation in a real-world application scenario.}

	abstract = {Key-value (KV) stores play an important role in today’s online service systems, but concerns about server-side attacks hinder users from uploading their workloads. The proposal of the hardware trusted execution environment (TEE) like Intel SGX provides an alternative for trusted computing on untrusted hosts. TEE can be used to construct privacy preserving scheme for KV stores. The current research on secure persistent KV store is limited to the shielded execution framework which involves a large trusted computing base and high overhead.In this paper, we propose Pldb, a secure persistent KV store that is based on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree. In order to ensure security, TEE’s access to persistent storage data needs to pass through the encryption/decryption interface. This is the main overhead of secure KV data storage based on TEE design. We designed a hybrid KV storage structure, which encrypts the value data and stores it directly on the disk, thereby reducing the encryption/decryption interface calls through the TEE. With a carefully designed architecture leveraging Intel SGX, Pldb provides security properties including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and data freshness to prevent rollback attacks. We extend LevelDB to implement a fully functional prototype system. Experiments show that our system can achieve reasonable overhead under different types of workloads.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the cutting edge cloud computing technology, millions of vulnerabilities have been identified, there is a growing concern that organizations should devote plenty of time and lots of resources to secure. The overarching objective of remediation is to prioritize the vulnerabilities. Hence, define the severity and the urgency of the vulnerabilities and remediate them automatically is very important. Although the recognized Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 4.0 method addresses this issues partly, they are difficult to be implemented in practices on the cloud because of the complication and lack of risk based factors.To this end, we propose a Cost-effective Massive Automation Method of Vulnerability Analysis and Remediation Based on Cloud Native Framework. Specifically, considering that the current CVSS is more like a severity of vulnerabilities, we design a novel formula to define the urgency of vulnerabilities. The formula takes the advantaged of the capabilities of modern cloud-based infrastructure and simplifies the CVSS. Besides, we propose an algorithm of risk reduction by leveraging the cloud native security capabilities, which cut down unnecessary patching time and workload. Particularly, in order to remediation the risk on the cloud, we implement an automatic scheme to harden the vulnerabilities by invoking the cloud native APIs based on the Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platform. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ours approach has a high ratio of urgency risk recognition of 99.24%. Meanwhile, ours approach shows a maximum risk reduction by downgrade the fixable vulnerability with a average of 79% risk reduction rate in application level and 99% of risk reduction rate in operating system level respectively. As a result, our approach lightens the workload of patching greatly in the real cloud computing environment.}

	abstract = {Recently, reputation and trust analysis, especially using e-commerce product reviews which could be accumulated as large scale of text data, has contributed increasing greatly to marketing economics. However, it is not easy to find out the useful comments timely, or make the appropriate evaluation automatically, due to their sheer volume and time-varying updates. Existing studies usually treat them based on usefulness or sentiment analysis as a single task, but it is easy to ignore the latent features among different data domain and the potential causal relationships of various tasks. In this study, we focus on the multi-task deep learning, to cope with the reputation and trust analysis in e-commerce systems using product reviews. A so-called BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) and VAE (Variational Autoencoder) Enhanced Multi-Task Neural Network (BiLV-MTNN) model is constructed to facilitate the evaluation, usefulness, and objectivity analysis simultaneously in a semi-supervised way. Specifically, A VAE based latent feature extraction mechanism and a BiLSTM based hidden vector generation mechanism are developed, which can contribute to the extraction of latent features and discovery of causal relationships among different tasks respectively. A labeling method is also proposed to quantify the objectivity of text composition based on the sentiment analysis, so as to improve the feature representation and further benefit the classification accuracy for multi-task learning. Compared with three baseline methods, experiments and evaluations using the Amazon data demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model in dealing with multi-task learning with alleviated negative transfer for trust-aware recommendation applications in e-commerce systems.}

	abstract = {We are increasingly required to prove our identity when using smartphones through explicit authentication processes such as passwords or physiological biometrics, e.g., authorising online banking transactions or unlocking smartphones. However, these methods are often annoying to input and do not guarantee that the genuine user remains the same. Thus, a modern verification process should differ from traditional authentication. In touch-based biometrics, a new approach must not verify what we draw but how we draw it. Our research proposes TouchEnc, a Deep Learning approach that outperforms conventional methods. Unlike Machine Learning methods, TouchEnc automates the feature extraction from touch gestures. TouchEnc achieves this by transforming and encoding touch behaviour into images, enabling continuous authentication through modern computer vision. Our approach has been tested on a popular and publicly available dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness. Results show that users can authenticate using TouchEnc with a single gesture containing users’ on-screen navigational behaviour, independent of drawing up, down, left, or right. TouchEnc achieves an 8.4% Equal Error Rate and a 96.7% Area Under the Curve using a single gesture. Furthermore, TouchEnc achieves up to 65% better Equal Error Rates when combining gestures compared to the related work.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic algorithms are fundamental to secure software development, but security vulnerabilities can arise during implementation, usage, and when calling third-party libraries. As security standards continue to evolve, software updates have become an inevitable trend, and detecting cryptographic algorithm misuse is crucial to ensure compliance with these standards during the update process. However, closed-source software presents challenges in detecting cryptographic algorithm misuse. To enhance the security ecosystem of software, we designed a hybrid detection approach for detecting misuses in closed-source software related to weak cryptographic algorithms, short keys, insecure working modes, and insecure padding modes. Our hybrid detection tool uses both static and dynamic detection methods to collect log information through a logging mechanism in binary executable files. The collected data is cleaned using a data cleaning strategy and analyzed to extract key features, generating test reports to help developers and experts identify cryptographic algorithm security issues. We tested 24 software applications from app stores and found that 62.5% had weak algorithm implementations or usage, 83.3% supported short keys, and 50% supported insecure padding modes. Finally, we provided actionable recommendations to mitigate identified issues.}

	abstract = {Terminal users can deploy verification tools to verify Windows code-signing signatures and check their details (signing time, certificate chain, etc). Some representative verification tools are also adopted in related studies, which take tools’ outputs as contributing factors to analyse malicious software or certificate ecosystems. However, as code-signing signature verification is related to multiple dimensions, such as certificate status and system policies, getting accurate signature status and details is essential but rather complicated. And performance of different tools in verifications has not been well studied and compared with.We provide a novel methodology to inspect Windows code-signing verification tools, checking that if they print consistent results and details. We choose four representative tools to verify massive samples (more than 26 million) and collect their outputs. During the verification, we deploy a two-step verification method, which efficiently excludes 78.8% of samples (not signed). We write scripts to read each line of outputs, learning tools’ output structures. Then we can precisely locate and extract interested code-signing fields from outputs. After that, we compare these essential fields from different tools, and analyze inconsistent cases. Finally, we present three types of inconsistent cases: verifying neglect, timestamp disturbance, and compatibility/robustness issues. We find some verification tools may assert code-signing signatures as invalid due to external factors, such as unexpected signing or invalid timestamp.}

	abstract = {The utilization of the broadband subliminal channel allows a sender to covertly transmit a message to a receiver through digital signatures. This method requires the sender to relinquish the signing key to the receiver. As a result, the receiver has the ability to employ the signing key to sign any data on behalf of the sender without the sender’s knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, difficulties may arise if the sender is unwilling to disclose the signing key to the receiver. In this paper, we propose a broadband subliminal channel that can be used in digital signature schemes (e.g., DSA, ECDSA, ElGamal, and Schnorr) without disclosing the signing key to the receiver. As it writes the message on a digital signature, we call it WMoS. We first implement WMoS in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). We then provide the security proof to show that signatures generated in WMoS have the same security level as standard ECDSA signatures. Moreover, we discuss the variants of WMoS in ECDSA and use them to construct applications. Furthermore, we use the implementation of WMoS to generate a signature for an Ethereum transaction to demonstrate its feasibility. We also evaluate the efficiency of WMoS in ECDSA, and the results show that WMoS in ECDSA can generate a signature as efficiently as the standard ECDSA.}

	abstract = {With the growing prominence of outsourcing services and increasing user concerns about security, existing encryption image retrieval schemes suffer from several limitations, such as low retrieval efficiency, poor retrieval accuracy, and inadequate scalability. Therefore, we propose an encrypted image retrieval scheme by dividing the clustering subspace with vertical parallels to construct indexes. Concretely, the data owners upload preprocessed classified datasets to a fully trusted auxiliary server. Subsequently, the auxiliary server clusters the images with the proximity relationships among their vector representations and employs the vertical bisecting lines of the key points to partition the clustered subspaces to encrypted indexes, namely the clustering encryption index of vertical subspace (CEIVS). This process efficiently filters out irrelevant images in advance, thereby enhancing the efficiency of encrypted retrieval. Ultimately, the Enhanced Asymmetric Scalar Product-preserving Encryption (E-ASPE) technique is adopted to ensure the security of the feature vectors, and a binary verification mechanism is proposed to detect data tampering, thereby ensuring the integrity of the retrieval results. While achieving data security, it is crucial to ensure that the results returned by the searchable encrypted image retrieval system align with the user queries, thereby enhancing the integrity of search results. Through comparative experimental analysis, this method outperforms existing solutions in terms of retrieval time and accuracy.}

	abstract = {With the increasing number of big data applications, large amounts of valuable data are distributed in different organizations or regions. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data and is widely used in AI medical diagnosis, economy, and autonomous driving scenarios. However, it still leaks the privacy from the gradient exchange in federated learning. What’s worse, state-of-the-art work, such as Batchcrypt, still suffers from computational overhead due to a considerable amount of computation and communication costs caused by homomorphic encryption. Therefore, we propose a novel symmetric key-based homomorphic encryption scheme, Sym-Fed. To unleash the power of symmetric encryption in federated learning, we combine random masking with symmetric encryption and keep the homomorphic property during the gradient exchange in the federated learning process. Finally, the security analysis and experimental results on real workloads show that our design achieves performance improvement 6× to 668× and reduces the communication overhead 1.2× to 107× compared with the state-of-the-art work, BatchCrypt and FATE, without model accuracy degradation and security compromise.}

	abstract = {The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is generally regarded as one of the most popular cryptographic algorithms for ensuring data security. Typical lightweight implementations of the algorithm published in the literature focus on area and power optimization, while neglecting the performance. This paper presents a novel lightweight approach for the AES algorithm and considers both encryption and decryption. In terms of performance per unit area and performance per unit power, our 32-bit design outperforms the state-of-the-art by 1.69x and 1.27x, respectively. These improvements become even larger when implementing higher data-path designs, such as 64-bit or 128-bit designs. To enhance its resilience against side-channel attacks, we modified our design by adopting and further improving on the most recent countermeasure, i.e., Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM). The results demonstrate that our five-stage and eight-stage 1 st -order DOM SBOX designs achieve a reduction in area of 9.9% and 6.9% compared to the original proposed design, respectively.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth and popularization of the Internet of Things (IoT), it has been applied to numerous fields such as smart industry, smart agriculture and smart home. Designing practical and robust authentication key agreement (AKA) schemes for smart environments has become a pressing problem to be solved. Due to differences in security requirements and resource allocation in smart environments, which we call security-asymmetry and resource-asymmetry, it is necessary to design specific AKA schemes for this environment. Since the design of remote AKA protocols does not fully consider security-asymmetry and resource-asymmetry, many existing schemes are not practical in smart environments. With regard to security-asymmetry, compared with traditional public-key techniques applied in AKA schemes, chaotic map is more effective than modular exponentiation and scalar multiplication, and it supplies many feasible attributes such as unpredictability, unrepeatability, uncertainty, which can be used to achieve communication security between users and gateways, while security operations based on hash function are sufficient to secure communications between gateways and smart devices. In view of resource-asymmetry, the complex operations in the authentication process can be completed by the gateway, so as to make full use of the rich resources on gateway side and reduce the use of resources on user side and device side. Based on such considerations, an efficient and secure authentication key agreement scheme based on chaotic map and physical unclonable function (PUF) for smart environments is proposed. We present a rigorous informal analysis of the proposed scheme. Moreover, the formal security verification is accomplished using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. Finally, performance evaluations indicate the proposed protocol consumes less communication cost and computation cost while achieving more security functions compared to other four state-of-the-art related schemes.}

We also tested GenRex on publicly available behavioral reports and achieved a high True Positive Rate of 92.34% and a low False Positive Rate of 0.01%.}

	abstract = {As the most common technique for mining and analyzing massive data, frequent itemset mining is widely used in various scenarios. However, when the data contains sensitive information, it will bring serious privacy leakage risks to mining and publishing it directly. Therefore, how to efficiently mine frequent itemset without privacy disclosure is a hot issue at present. In data stream, because the data between adjacent timestamps possess certain correlation, which makes it easier to leak privacy for frequent itemset mining in the data stream, and considering that frequent itemset will have combinatorial explosion problem in data stream, frequent closed itemset mining in the data stream will be a better choice. In this paper, we propose a differential privacy algorithm for mining frequent closed itemset in data stream, which is referred to as DPES. The algorithm uses a vertical mining method in each sliding window, which can quickly obtain the frequent closed itemset contained in the current window. Besides, to improve the data utility, we also design an adaptive privacy budget allocation strategy by computing the difference to decide whether the current timestamp should publish a low-noise statistic or an approximate statistic. Finally, we demonstrate that the DPES algorithm satisfies ε-difference privacy by privacy analysis, and the experimental results on several real datasets also show the effectiveness of the DPES algorithm.}

	abstract = {Recently there has been many studies on backdoor attacks, which involve injecting poisoned samples into the training set in order to embed backdoors into the model. Existing multiple poisoned samples attacks usually randomly select a subset from clean samples to generate the poisoned samples. Filtering-and-Updating Strategy (FUS) has shown that the poisoning efficiency of each poisoned sample is inconsistent and random selection is not optimal. However, FUS does not fully considered the selection of multiple poisoned samples, there are still some issues with the selection of multiple poisoned samples. In this paper, we formulate the selection of multiple types of poisoned samples as a multi-objective optimization problem and proposed a Multiple Poisoned Samples Selection Strategy (MPS) to solve the issue. Unlike FUS, we consider the potential of clean samples that are not selected as to become efficient poisoned samples. Specifically, we use a weight-based contribution approach to calculate the contribution of each sample (clean sample and poisoned sample) during the training process from multiple dimensions. Finally, based on the greedy approach, we retain a subset of samples with the largest contribution in each dimension through iterations. We evaluate the effectiveness of MPS on various attack methods, including BadNet, Blended, ISSBA, and WaNet, as well as benchmark datasets. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB show that MPS can increase the attack strength by 1.45% to 18.34% compared to RSS and 0.43% to 10.84% compared to FUS in multiple poisoned samples attacks, thereby enhancing the stealthiness of the attack. Meanwhile, MPS is suitable for black-box settings, meaning that poisoned samples selected in one setting can be applied to other settings.}

Existing detecting methods mainly focus on specific types of malicious attacks or document categories. It is lack of universal detection method for multi-version documents and multi-class malicious attacks. To address the issue, this paper proposes a Unified Feature Analyzing and Detecting Framework UFADF for multi-class malicious Office document detection. It is implemented with three-fold interesting ideas: a) analyzing 20,000 latest real-world Office document samples and extracting the key features of various malicious categories, which innovatively design five mainstream malicious feature extraction methods with eight new features or embedding locations; b) calculating the information gain of all the extracted malicious key features, then choosing the most 64 prominent malicious features to construct the feature list with a newly proposed feature fusion algorithm; c) detecting the fused malicious features with an adaptive classifier, which classifies Office documents with various versions and formats into five malicious categories and benign documents. Through the experiments on 20,000 latest real-world Office document samples, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework UFADF achieve high-precision unified feature detection, including detecting 185 malicious samples with accurate classifications which undetected by antivirus software.}

	abstract = {Machine learning technology has achieved excellent results in Android malware detection, however, existing detection methods ignore the frequent changes of API in malware, resulting in their detection performance continuing to decline over time. In this paper, we propose an evolved Android malware detection method (EAMDM). Two components comprise EAMDM: API clustering and malware detection. Before malware detection, we perform API clustering to obtain cluster centers representing the function of each API. we employ Bert to comprehensively extract the semantic information contained in API features such as method name, exception, and permission. Bert generates feature vectors for clustering that represent the similarity of API functions. In malware detection, EAMDM abstracts the API into cluster centers in order to maintain resilience against the frequent changes of API in both malware and Android framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of EAMDM on a dataset of 85K apps developed over seven years. The experimental results show that EAMDM greatly outperforms the existing classic methods and has a significantly slower aging speed.}

	abstract = {Databases play a crucial role in storing and managing vast amounts of data in various organizations and industries. Yet the risk of database leakage poses a significant threat to data privacy and security. To trace the source of database leakage, researchers have proposed many database watermarking schemes. Among them, fake-tuples-based database watermarking shows great potential as it does not modify the original data of the database, ensuring the seamless usability of the watermarked database. However, the existing fake-tuple-based database watermarking schemes need to insert a large number of fake tuples for the embedding of each watermark bit, resulting in low watermark transparency. Therefore, we propose a novel database watermarking scheme based on fake tuples and sparse priority strategy, named SPSW, which achieves the same watermark capacity with a lower number of inserted fake tuples compared to the existing embedding strategy. Specifically, for a database about to be watermarked, we prioritize embedding the sparsest watermark sequence, i.e., the sequence containing the most ‘0’ bits among the currently available watermark sequences. For each bit in the sparse watermark sequence, when it is set to ‘1’, SPSW will embed the corresponding set of fake tuples into the database. Otherwise, no modifications will be made to the database. Through theoretical analysis, the proposed sparse priority strategy not only improves transparency but also enhances the robustness of the watermark. The comparative experimental results with other database watermarking schemes further validate the superior performance of the proposed SPSW, aligning with the theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {Software vulnerabilities detection is crucial in cyber security which protects the software systems from malicious attacks. The majority of earlier techniques relied on security professionals to provide software features before training a classification or regression model on the features to find vulnerabilities. However, defining software features and collecting high-quality labeled vulnerabilities for training are both time consuming. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised and effective method for extracting software features and detecting software vulnerabilities automatically. Firstly, we obtain software features and build a new pre-trained BERT model through constructing C/C++ vocabulary and pre-training on software source code. We then fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model with a deep autoencoder and create low-dimensional embedding from the software features. We finally apply a clustering-based outlier detection method on the embedding to detect vulnerabilities. We evaluate our method on five datasets with programs written in C/C++, experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art software vulnerability detection methods.}

To cater to the demands of real-world MCS workloads, we designed a distributed multi-layer architecture and leveraged distributed hash functions(DHT) and broadcast encryption(BE) to achieve load-balancing and enforce access control. Our scheme incorporates a recently developed cryptographic tool–function secret sharing (FSS) to safeguard the query pattern and sensory data from potential compromises at the server layer.The analysis demonstrates that our scheme achieves affordable query complexity while satisfying adaptive \\mathcal{L}-semantic security. Encouraging experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our scheme, the growth rates of query cost diminishes as the number of records and participants increases. These findings emphasize the suitability of our scheme for crowdsensing applications with fine-grained access control requirements and establish it as an efficient cryptographic tool that holds promise for diverse MCS applications.}

	abstract = {Cross-core cache side-channel attacks allow attackers to launch more threatening cross-virtual machine (cross-VM) attacks in the virtualized environment. Most of these cross-core cache side-channel attacks take advantage of the feature that the last-level cache (LLC) is shared by all cores. However, these attacks may not perform well in cross-core attacks on processors that the LLC is not shared by all cores. This paper mainly focuses on the AMD Zen series processors, which introduce the design of the CPU complex (or Core Complex, CCX), and different CCXs have their independent LLCs. We find that previous cross-core cache side-channel attacks such as Flush+Reload do not work well in crossing CCXs on these processors, as these attacks mainly utilize the sharing characteristics of the LLC between different cores. In this paper, we present a cross-CCX side-channel attack named Flush+Revisit. As far as we know, we are the first to study cross-CCX side-channel attacks on AMD processors. Compared with traditional cache side-channel attacks, when crossing CCX, a more distinguishable time difference can be observed between accessed and unaccessed addresses with Flush+Revisit. We have carried out evaluation experiments to show that Flush+Revisit is an effective cross-CCX side-channel attack on an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor, which is known to have employed the CCX structure. In addition, we have also applied Flush+Revisit in a real-world attack scenario: attacking the T-Table-based AES implementation of OpenSSL in the cross-CCX scenario and leaking the full 128-bit key on the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor within 3.75 seconds successfully, with an error rate of 0.00%.}

	abstract = {Speaker Recognition Systems (SRSs) are becoming increasingly popular in various aspects of life due to advances in technology. However, these systems are vulnerable to cyber threats, particularly adversarial attacks. Traditional adversarial attack methods, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are designed for a white-box setting where attackers have complete knowledge of the inner workings of the target systems. This limits the practicality of these attacks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new attack model that uses a neural network to generate adversarial examples directly, without the need for full knowledge of the recognition model in a target SRS. In addition, we have designed a novel loss function to balance the effectiveness and confidentiality of adversarial examples. Our new approach was evaluated against SincNet, a state-of- the-art SRS. Experimental results show that our approach achieves outstanding performance, with the best attack success rate of 99.83% and the best Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value of 41.30.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attack has emerged as a novel and concerning threat to AI security. These attacks involve the training of Deep Neural Network (DNN) on datasets that contain hidden trigger patterns. Although the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, it exhibits abnormal behavior on samples containing the trigger pattern. However, most existing backdoor attacks suffer from two significant drawbacks: their trigger patterns are visible and easy to detect by backdoor defense or even human inspection, and their injection process results in the loss of natural sample features and trigger patterns, thereby reducing the attack success rate and model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack named SATBA that overcomes these limitations using spatial attention and an U-net based model. The attack process begins by using spatial attention to extract meaningful data features and generate trigger patterns associated with clean images. Then, an U-shaped model is used to embed these trigger patterns into the original data without causing noticeable feature loss. We evaluate our attack on three prominent image classification DNN across three standard datasets. The results demonstrate that SATBA achieves high attack success rate while maintaining robustness against backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we conduct extensive image similarity experiments to emphasize the stealthiness of our attack strategy. Overall, SATBA presents a promising approach to backdoor attack, addressing the shortcomings of previous methods and showcasing its effectiveness in evading detection and maintaining high attack success rate.}

	abstract = {Traditional security solutions focus on identifying threats that leave traces on the system’s hard drive. However, fileless attacks have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals due to their ability to evade detection and persist undetected for prolonged periods. In response, memory forensics facilitates the extraction of system memory activities, presenting an opportunity to detect fileless attacks executed directly in memory. This paper presents MemInspect, a specialized memory forensics approach designed to extract features and accurately identify and locate suspicious memory regions, effectively aiding analysts in investigating fileless malware attacks. Specifically, By Utilizing virtual address descriptor nodes as samples, MemInspect constructs a comprehensive set of 42 features to detect code injection, script-based attacks, and living off the land attacks. Subsequently, these features are employed for classification using ensemble learning algorithms. In this study, we meticulously designed comprehensive attack experiments, accurately simulating three prevalent types of fileless attacks. Through rigorous analysis and extensive training on the experimental data, MemInspect demonstrates remarkable performance, achieving an impressive Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 98%. Additionally, the paper provides two detailed analysis cases of attack investigations, furnishing concrete evidence of MemInspect’s efficacy in detecting fileless attacks.}

	abstract = {Erasure codes have been widely applied to in-memory key-value storage systems for high reliability and low redundancy. In distributed in-memory key-value storage systems, update operations are relatively frequent, especially the partial-stripe update, which makes data update more challenging. Recently, existing research has been based on appending logs to accelerate parity data write. However, its logs are stored on disks, which decreases the system performance significantly. Therefore, we propose a novel in-memory key-value storage architecture, DNVPL, which utilizes NVRAM to log parity data. Our main idea is to design an appending-only update scheme to tradeoff the memory cost and the update overhead. We implement DNVPL with an in-memory key-value storage prototype, called LogKV. We evaluate it with different workloads. The experiments show that our scheme achieves high update performance from different metrics. Our scheme can reduce update latency by up to 49% and save storage space by 48% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.}

To prevent the privacy leakage of trajectories from the direct data outsourcing, in this paper, we study the secure similarity search problem on spatio-temporal trajectories and present a secure synchronized spatio-temporal trajectory similarity search approach. In the approach, adopting the Matching Point-point distance Similarity (MPS) measurement, we first propose a Secure Matching Point-point Distance Similarity Computation (SMPSC) Protocol to support the secure similarity calculation on encrypted trajectories. To improve the computational performance, we further propose a Secure Grid Filtering (SGF) method by matching spatio-temporal grid codes to filter the dissimilar trajectories based on the distance threshold in MPS. At last, with SMPSC protocol and SGF method, we propose a Secure Synchronized Spatio-Temporal Trajectory similarity Search Processing (S 3 TS) method to retrieve similar trajectories based on MPS measurement. We theoretically analyze the computational complexity and security guarantees of the presented approach, and conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate its search performance.}

	abstract = {Due to cloud security concerns, there is an increasing interest in information retrieval systems that can support private queries over public documents. It is desirable for oblivious document ranking and retrieval in public cloud at lower cost and faster speed without revealing query-related information. Currently, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and private information retrieval (PIR) techniques are used to solve this problem, but the encryption operation time is over dominant. Motivated by the observation of the sparsity of the TF-IDF matrix, we propose an efficient approach for oblivious document ranking and retrieval, called E-Coeus. It takes advantage of the high sparsity of the TF-IDF matrix to rearrange the matrix. Our method accelerates the speed of PIR inadvertently retrieving documents and reduces the user retrieval delay time. In a stand-alone experiment for a TF-IDF matrix of 1.2M rows and 64K columns with the sparsity of 10%, E-Coeus improves the document ranking and retrieval performance by 23% over the state-of-the-art approach, Coeus. With cluster of 64 machines, E-Coeus improves the performance by 34% over Coeus when the TF-IDF matrix sparsity is 30%.}

	abstract = {Traditional coverage-based fuzzing gives equal attention to every part of a code. Despite much progress, we observe that existing schemes still not comprehensively use the coverage feedback mechanism when fuzzing bulky JavaScript engines because of severe path collisions. To improve the precision of coverage feedback and target the vulnerable JIT compiler of Javascript engines, we presented our fuzzer, called LF(Light Fuzzer), a lightweight and high-precision fuzzer for bulky JavaScript engines fuzzing. First, LF advocates a technique to confine instrumentation to the JIT-related "critical functions" to mitigate collisions. Additionally, LF utilizes static analysis to establish dominant relationships between critical functions. Lastly, LF incorporates seed scheduling with feedback information of control flow at the function level to dynamically target JIT. These combined strategies make LF a lightweight and high-precision fuzzer for fuzzing bulky JavaScript engines. In our evaluation, LF outperforms the state-of-art coverage-guided JavaScript fuzzer DIE in different coverage types, and LF is also more effective in triggering unique crashes compared to DIE.}

	abstract = {Rust is an emerging programming language that has gained popularity in many academic and industrial projects due to its memory safety features. However, despite its safety advantages, there are still many serious bugs in existing Rust projects. The lack of suitable fuzz targets has been a major challenge in Rust fuzz testing, as existing fuzzing tools often rely on manual efforts to write test targets, which is time-consuming and cannot be directly applied to library function interfaces. While the previous work has made significant progress in generating fuzz targets for Rust, it still cannot effectively test special functions with generics and polymorphism.To address this issue, this paper proposes an automated approach for generating fuzz targets for Rust library functions, called RVFuzz. RVFuzz addresses the challenges by performing static analysis through variable instantiation, ensuring that special functions in Rust, such as those with generics and polymorphism, are covered in the interface sequence analysis. It then traverses the library function dependency graph to generate a set of reasonable and non-redundant target function sequences for fuzz testing. Any compilation errors encountered during the process are used to refine the sequence generation. RVFuzz successfully generated fuzz targets for 10 popular Rust projects, achieving an impressive interface coverage rate of 92.3%.}

	abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WF) is commonly used to deanonymize the Tor users. Meanwhile, WF can also be applied to the hidden service (HS) side, to destroy the anonymity of the HS operator. However, the attacker faces the problem of no available data for training. To solve this problem, previous researchers build mirror sites and use the data collected on them to train the classifier. However, this approach still has limitations: The attacker cannot tell whether the target HS is some HS that is not in the set of sites he mirrors, i.e, an HS in the wild. To address this, we propose a novel two-phase approach to deanonymize HSs that using the website fingerprint collected on the remote node, i.e., a node on the same RP circuit with HS. Our approach does not rely on mirror sites because we decouple feature extraction from classification, so that mirror sites are only involved in the training of the feature extractor and are not related to the classification process. The experimental results show that our attack is effective in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {The fully homomorphic encryption schemes FHEW/TFHE support fast bootstrapping to refresh ciphertexts. However, executing FHEW/TFHE with SIMD bootstrapping is inefficient due to the algebraic structure. For the theoretical state of the art, LW23 (Liu and Wang, Eurocrypt2023) proposed a mathematical framework for SIMD bootstrapping, while the ciphertext slots are limited in size\nO\n~\n(\nλ\n0.25\n)\nand total complexity of\nO(\n2\nρ−1\nn)\nfor n(= O(λ)) LWE ciphertexts.This paper aims at developing an efficient FHE scheme with SIMD bootstrapping, called Batch RGSW, which yields overall bootstrapping complexity O(n 2/ε ), ε > 2. To achieve this, there are two main steps to craft our scheme. Firstly, we decompose a cyclotomic ring into two smaller subrings R1 for the ciphertext space and ℛ 2 for the base as slots. The ciphertext is then extracted with basic automorphic rotations. In this way, we obtain a batch RGSW scheme with ciphertext slots in size of\nO\n~\n(\nλ\n0.5\n)\n. Secondly, we combine Partial Fast Fourier Transformation (PFFT) with Batch RGSW scheme to reduce bootstrapping amortized cost. We utilize PFFT for coefficient decomposition and perform batch homomorphic multiplications. We end up with a bootstrapping algorithm with amortized complexity O(1).}

In conjunction with the maturity and growth of artificial intelligence, employing AI technology for SQL injection detection has evolved into an unalterable trend. This study introduces the application of an Improved Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Network (IE-GAN) for the synthesis of SQL injection attacks, thereby facilitating the generation of realistic SQL injection attack examples. Given the considerable threat posed by SQL injection attacks to the security of web applications, the demand for robust and efficient detection mechanisms has escalated significantly. Earlier research has made considerable progress in incorporating GANs in the field of cybersecurity.Our study builds upon these achievements, utilizing a comprehensive dataset that includes both benign and malicious SQL queries. To ensure the efficiency of model training, these data are subjected to intricate preprocessing and vectorization processes, which are discussed in the paper in detail.}

	abstract = {Side channel attack is a serious threat in cross-user deduplication, which could be utilized to steal existence privacy of the target data in cloud storage in a statistical way. Even though dirty chunks processing is employed as an effective technique to deal with this risk, it brings about the problem of low efficiency since every entailed chunk is required. Moreover, in this paper, we propose a more sophisticated random chunks generation attack, which still cannot be well resisted since non-duplicate chunks in requests could be constructed artificially to avoid being added into the dirty chunk list. In order to resist this attack, we propose a novel secure deduplication mechanism for cloud storage, which takes the lead to well protect the existence privacy of target chunks. Specifically, we design a mixed security strategy to construct the response table according to the number of non-duplicate chunks adaptively, which ensures the security with the minimum cost introduced no matter how many randomly generated non-duplicate chunks are contained in a single deduplication request. Furthermore, we also propose a lightweight dirty chunks processing mechanism to achieve security under statistical side channel attacks. The security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to resist the random chunks generation attack in a lightweight way comparing with the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {The device fingerprinting technique extracts fingerprints based on the hardware characteristics of the device to identify the device. The primary goal of device fingerprinting is to accurately and uniquely identify a device, which requires the generated device fingerprints to have good stability to achieve long-term tracking of the target device. However, the fingerprints generated by some existing fingerprinting technologies are not stable enough or change frequently, making it impossible to track the target device for a long time. In this paper, we present FPHammer, a novel DRAM-based fingerprinting technique. The device fingerprint generated by our technique has high stability and can be used to track the device for a long time. We leverage the Rowhammer technique to repeatedly and quickly access a row in DRAM to get bit flips in its adjacent row. We then construct a physical fingerprint of the device based on the locations of the collected bit flips. The evaluation results of the uniqueness and reliability of the physical fingerprint show that it can be used to distinguish devices with the same hardware and software configuration. The experimental results on device identification demonstrate that the physical fingerprints engendered by our innovative technique are inherently linked to the entirety of the device rather than just the DRAM module. Even if the device modifies software-level parameters such as MAC address and IP address or even reinstalls the operating system, we can accurately identify the target device. This demonstrates that FPHammer can generate stable fingerprints that are not affected by software layer parameters.}

	abstract = {According to the European General Data Protection Regulation and the principle of Privacy-by-design developers should embed methods of privacy protection into their projects at an early stage. However, studies show that developers are either lacking the tools or the training to apply the appropriate methods. Hence, to ensure the development of privacy-preserving software it is important to understand developers’ issues with methods of privacy-preserving computation. To this end, we have sent a questionnaire to 407 participants with diverse backgrounds to investigate their perceptions of privacy in general and of the methods k-anonymity, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation in particular. We compared the results to developers’ issues on Stack Overflow. We observe that raising the awareness about these methods increases developers’ willingness to use them in the future. We also validate previously known privacy-related issues developers face. Including privacy-preserving methods in programming education and, thereby, raising developers’ awareness could therefore enhance the privacy protection of software products.}

However, such schemes still lack the capabilities to provide higher Level of Assurance (LoA) guarantees, for identity verification, which restricts their full potential. In this paper, we design and showcase DOOR; a library that enables Identity Wallets to leverage hardware Roots-of-Trust (RoT) for binding user authentication factors to HW-based keys, thus, allowing for both proof of (User) identity and (Wallet) integrity, bringing them in alignment with emerging regulations and standards that require higher LoA for services (e.g. eIDAS). At the same time, we make sure that privacy-enhancing properties like selective-disclosure are fully supported in order to make the Wallet compliant with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To achieve all the above, we have designed an enhanced variant of Attribute-based Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA-A) crypto protocol for offering anonymity, unlinkability, and unforgeability, while being the first to offer strong guarantees on the Wallet’s integrity when constructing attribute attestations. We formally prove the security properties of DOOR, offered by the underlying crypto primitives used to enable selective disclosure of attributes, by describing their construction while also benchmarking their computational footprint and comparing them with other widespread cryptographic mechanisms (adopted by the standards) in terms of performance, size of the associated verifiable presentations while safeguarding user anonymous authentication and unlinkability.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel obfuscation technique that can be used to outsource hard satisfiability (SAT) formulas to the cloud. Servers with large computational power are typically used to solve SAT instances that model real-life problems in task scheduling, AI planning, circuit verification and more. However, outsourcing data to the cloud may lead to privacy and information breaches since satisfying assignments may reveal considerable information about the underlying problem modeled by SAT.In this work, we develop CENSOR, a SAT obfuscation framework that resembles Indistinguishability Obfuscation. At the core of the framework lies a mechanism that transforms any formula to a random one with the same number of satisfying assignments. As a result, obfuscated formulas are indistinguishable from each other thus preserving the input-output privacy of the original SAT instance. Contrary to prior solutions that are rather adhoc in nature, we formally prove the security of our scheme. Additionally, we show that obfuscated formulas are within a polynomial factor of the original ones thus achieving polynomial slowdown. Finally, the whole process is efficient in practice, allowing solutions to original instances to be easily recovered from obfuscated ones. A byproduct of our method is that all NP problems can be potentially outsourced to the cloud by means of reducing to SAT.}

	abstract = {Conventional matrix factorization relies on centralized collection of users’ data for recommendation, which might introduce an increased risk of privacy leakage especially when the recommender is untrusted. Existing differentially private matrix factorization methods either assume the recommender is trusted, or can only provide a uniform level of privacy protection for all ratings in untrusted recommender scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Differentially Private Matrix Factorization algorithm (HDPMF) for untrusted recommender. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve heterogeneous differential privacy for decentralized matrix factorization in untrusted recommender scenario. Specifically, our framework uses modified stretching mechanism with an innovative rescaling scheme to achieve better trade-off between privacy and accuracy. Meanwhile, by allocating privacy budget properly, we can capture homogeneous privacy preference within a user/item but heterogeneous privacy preference across different users/items. Theoretical analysis confirms that HDPMF renders rigorous privacy guarantee, and exhaustive experiments demonstrate its superiority especially in strong privacy guarantee, high dimension model and sparse dataset scenario.}

	abstract = {Virtualization is a crucial technology for consolidating workloads and improving resource utilization in modern computing systems. seL4 is a small TCB (Trusted Computing Base) microkernel that can be used as a hypervisor to provide virtualization features. However, providing standard device interfaces to it remains a significant challenge in achieving secure and high-performance virtualization solutions for critical systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an approach that leverages the VirtIO standard through QEMU to provide a secure and efficient device virtualization solution for seL4. The feature takes advantage of seL4’s isolation guarantees and enables sharing of complex devices for multiple virtual machines, combined with the efficient communication interface provided by the VirtIO standard. We implemented and evaluated the approach using a set of benchmarks. The proposed approach leverages the VirtIO standard through QEMU on top of the seL4, aiming to offer a virtualization solution that accelerates development speed and enhances architectural flexibility by eliminating the need for native drivers.}

	abstract = {Social media plays a significant role in our lives, providing convenience in accessing information and expressing opinions through various platforms. However, this convenience has also led to the proliferation of rumors. Therefore, detecting rumors on social media has become increasingly important. Many existing works focus on detecting rumors by analyzing source posts and comments posted by users, utilizing pre-trained language models to capture text representations. However, simply averaging the comments from different users fails to capture the correlation between comments and source posts, which is crucial for rumor detection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale feature aggregation method. We utilize a BERT-based pre-trained language model to encode the source posts and comment texts, obtaining token scale feature representations. Furthermore, to differentiate between different comments, we perform secondary aggregation of features at the comment scale, mitigating the limitations of previous methods that treat all comments equally. We then employ an attention layer to obtain a correlation weight matrix between the source posts and comments, which represents their correlation. This approach significantly extracts comment content most relevant to the current event being detected. Experimental results on existing datasets in both Chinese and English demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other existing approaches. Further experiments also confirm the importance of the multi-scale approach in mining the correlation between source posts and comments for rumor detection.}

	abstract = {The GDPR is a set of regulations designed to give users control over their personal data and applies to any connected object that processes such data. One of the most complex environments covered by the GDPR is the connected car, which has brought attention to the sensitive data processed by these vehicles. This data includes information about the driver or owner, the vehicle’s environment, and the vehicle itself. Given the varying sensitivity levels of this data, it is important to offer users control over their data and privacy. To address this, we propose an end-to-end privacy preserving framework that ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and traceability of data related to user privacy within a connected vehicle. This framework combines data tainting for data traceability, lightweight signature for data integrity, and attribute-based encryption for confidentiality and access control to effectively enforce privacy policies set by both vehicle users and manufacturers. This approach is the first to offer end-to-end privacy and confidentiality policy enforcement for connected vehicles, covering data generation by sensors to the Transmission Control Unit.}

	abstract = {In recent years, secret image sharing (SIS) has attracted extensive attention in the academic community due to its advantages of loss tolerance and low computational complexity. To enhance the robustness of SIS system, it is vital to study SIS technology that can resist shadow image cropping. Unfortunately, the current research on this topic is limited. In view of this, this paper proposes a robust SIS scheme for color images, which can resist large-scale shadow image cropping. The proposed scheme generates shadow images of the same size as the original secret image by integrating SIS, error correction coding, and pixel re-arrangement techniques. Even in the extreme case that all shadow images are cropped by 25%, it can still achieve lossless recovery regardless of whether the cropping positions of each shadow image intersect or overlap. In addition, it can resist shadow image noise, such as salt-and-pepper noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has significant advantages over existing schemes in robustness and overall performance and is expected to promote the practical application of SIS.}

	abstract = {As a new paradigm of machine learning, green learning has achieved performance comparable to deep learning in vision tasks, knowledge graph learning, and modeling graph structures. Compared with deep learning, green learning has the advantages of a low carbon footprint, lightweight model and logical transparency. In this paper, to enhance the robustness of green learning, we study the performance of the green model when the training dataset labels are noisy. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we found that noisy labels will not only reduce the performance of green learning, but also amplify the risk of privacy leaks of training dataset members. Therefore, we propose a robust green learning to approach the above two threats. Specifically, we design a multi-stage label-consistency sample selection method to filter out noisy labels in the training dataset by taking advantage of the characteristics of unsupervised representation learning in green learning. In order to further improve the stable classification performance of the model, we propose a feature-level class-balanced data augmentation method in the feature decision learning stage to solve the class imbalance problem caused by sample selection. Finally, a large number of experiments on multiple noisy datasets show that the robust green learning method proposed in this paper can not only enhance the generalization of the model under noisy training labels, but also alleviate the risk of member privacy information leakage.}

	abstract = {The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is capable of generating high-quality images, surpassing earlier generative models by producing fake images. To effectively handle the high computational workload and the large number of parameters involved, outsourcing to cloud servers is a more suitable option. However, utilizing cloud servers for image synthesis also presents the risk of privacy breaches. Additionally, existing privacy-preserving GANs operate on a semi-honest model with two parties, which fails to resist malicious attacks. This paper introduces a novel image synthesis framework that involves three parties, enabling privacy-preserving Deep Convolutional GAN(DCGAN) on the cloud in both semi-honest and malicious scenarios. The secure data reconstruction implemented in this framework detects adversary attacks under the malicious model and aborts computation upon detection. Furthermore, we offer a range of highly efficient and accurate secure computation protocols specifically designed for DCGAN-based image synthesis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our secure GAN(SecGAN) can produce image quality comparable to that of the plaintext method.}

	abstract = {Data authorization is the basis for the orderly sharing of medical data. Most of the applied decentralized authorization mechanisms rely on blockchain, but face the problems of privacy leakage and low efficiency. To solve these problems, we design a policy-driven decentralized authorization system named BAA, which protects user's behavior privacy in medical data sharing and improves efficiency of both on-chain and off-chain. In order to achieve these goals, BAA uses authorization tokens to represent permissions, protects privacy of the authorization process through hiding user behaviors, realizes batch data accessing by proposing a two-tier Merkle tree, and saves authorization data in a two-tier blockchain to improve on-chain efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the overhead of cryptographic operations in BAA is acceptable compared to that in traditional authorization systems. In addition, throughput and latency of each operation in BAA can meet the efficiency needs of medical data authorization. The results also show that the preset authorization in blockchain is effective for reducing data user's waiting time and improving the efficiency of authorization.}

	abstract = {Biometric authenticators aim to provide a safe, secure, and accurate authentication process in restricted areas. Despite their advantages, biometric authenticators are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, such as spoofing attacks. Spoofing attacks enable malicious actors to masquerade as someone else to gain illegitimate access or privilege. To proceed, the attacker forges fake biometric data or duplicates existing ones. In such a context, the evaluation of the robustness of biometric authenticators is paramount to assessing their resilience potential and derive deployment strategies. Through this work, we propose a generic assessment method, based on a metric which quantifies the robustness of biometrics against cyber-attacks. Our methodology can be adapted to different families of cyber-attacks targeting biometric authentication techniques. We demonstrate our approach by considering spoofing-attacks. To achieve this objective, we present an extended state-of-the-art of biometrics (physiological and behavioural), including emerging biometric technologies. We also provide an overview of spoofing-attacks for each identified biometric mechanism in the literature. Based on this knowledge, we quantify and we combine the characteristics of such attacks into a quantitative robustness metric which can be applied to both a single and a combination of authenticators.}

	abstract = {Modern Medical Devices (MMDs) are a rapidly growing field of medical technology, and recent advances have allowed them to monitor and manage patients’ health remotely. As these devices become more connected in order to enhance the delivery of patient care, the concerns surrounding security, privacy, and safety are also increasing. To effectively address these concerns, "shift-left security"-which involves addressing security risks as early as possible-is becoming increasingly important. To facilitate it, threat modeling must be implemented as the first step. While various threat modeling methodologies exist, MMDs need a tailored one that can take into account the safety of patients and the complexity of a typical Medical Device (MD), which contains multiple sensors and actuators. Therefore, we present a new threat modeling methodology -MEDICALHARM- tailored to identifying threats in MMD systems. MEDICALHARM delivers a holistic approach by combining threat and risk analysis under the same scheme. It specifically articulates safety threats along with security and privacy threats. Furthermore, it offers an algorithmic scheme to enable non-security experts (engineers and developers) to easily participate in the threat modeling process. To illustrate its benefits, we perform a threat modeling exercise using MEDICALHARM on a Deep Brain Stimulation device and provide an exhaustive threats document. We then compare the results of this exercise with another threat model scheme (STRIDE) to demonstrate MEDICALHARM’s efficiency in threat identification.}

	abstract = {As a new self-developed protocol of V2Ray, mKCP disguises users’ network access as communication of four network applications by forging application layer headers to evade traffic-based detection. The emergence of mKCP has received widespread attention. Whether mKCP can provide secure network access that protects user privacy is the focus. Traditional methods cannot identify mKCP camouflage traffic, but machine learning (ML)-based traffic identification is considered a promising direction. Unlike the previous network traffic classification, mKCP camouflage traffic identification introduces new challenges. First, existing work has neither published any dataset containing mKCP camouflage traffic nor designed specific traffic features. Second, no researchers have optimized the identification scheme for deployment on network devices. Aiming at the shortcomings, we propose SharpEye, an ML-based mKCP camouflage traffic identification scheme. The novelty of our work lies in three points. Firstly, a complete dataset containing mKCP camouflage traffic is constructed through long-term traffic collection. Secondly, by analyzing the communication patterns of mKCP traffic, a feature set mFS is designed to improve identification accuracy. Finally, a two-stage feature selection method mGBFS is proposed to improve the operation efficiency. The experimental results show that mFS can enhance the performance of classifiers in identifying mKCP camouflage traffic, and mGBFS reduces the running time and overhead while ensuring high accuracy. Therefore, SharpEye achieves accurate and efficient mKCP camouflage traffic identification.}

We model the problem with a game theory model that balances customers’ benefit and the service provider’s profit, and the optimal price is acquired that both parties could accept. More specifically, in the game model, we calculate customers’ average waiting time with bulk service queueing model, and linearly estimate the customers’ benefit in terms of privacy from withdrawing their data. Our method RUE shows that both parties get more benefit or profit than others, which could make the unlearning service run smoothly when the concerns about the high price are removed. We also analyse the influence of the waiting time on the number of unlearning requests and on the price.}

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet, many industrial control system (ICS) remote management devices for key infrastructure, such as solar power plants, sewage treatment, and buildings, are easily exposed to the Internet through network connections. Existing studies on ICS detection can not detect these remote management devices, which are not open to specific industrial control protocol services. Effectively identifying exposed real-world ICS remote management devices while minimizing the attack surface remains an enormous challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-level fEature fusioN DiscovEry fRamework (MENDER) for discovering neglected ICS remote management devices. First, we conduct a comprehensive and multi-level data collection in the detection process, including the traffic generated by website access, web resource files and HTML. We build an efficient and comprehensive data detection and acquisition module. Second, we design a novel multi-level feature extraction and fusion model to mine key features from raw data. We perform hierarchical clustering based on HTML features and combine the extracted multi-layered key features to filter potential ICS remote management devices. Third, we use the Random Forest model to classify and predict ICS devices based on the extracted multi-level features, aiming to learn inherent features profoundly for enhanced detection of these remote management devices. In a month, we detect 1, 069 devices in Japan, some of devices are insecure, i.e. allowing access to the status or even the control industrial devices without proper authentication. Compared with existing method, MENDER’s time spent on device discovery has been reduced by 94.1%, the number of device discovery is increased by 20.1%, and 26 different types of devices are found. Our MENDER’s device discover ability is superior to it both in time and quantity.}

	abstract = {In low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, a single satellite’s computing and storage resources are limited, necessitating fine-grained partitioning of computing tasks. Because the topology of LEO satellite networks frequently changes, traditional scheduling strategies may lead to an increase in total task delay while scheduling multiple computing subtasks to satellite nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained task scheduling algorithm (DDPG-FTS) based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). This algorithm continuously interacts with the LEO satellite network environment, learning the selection strategy of satellite nodes. In addition, in order to reduce the path re-plan delay during task transmission, a path selection algorithm for the LEO satellite network is introduced. The algorithm reduces the path re-plan caused by Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) connectivity changes and effectively reduces the transmission delay of tasks. Simulation experiments validate that our proposed algorithm more effectively adapts to the dynamic changes of topology in LEO satellite networks, reducing the total task delay and improving the acceptance rate of tasks compared with the baseline algorithm.}

	abstract = {Edge computing has become a promising technology to mitigate the latency of various cloud services. Task scheduling in edge computing is challenging due to the heterogeneous devices and multiple tasks. This paper proposes an affinity-based scheduling algorithm to solve the multi-task scheduling problem with heterogeneous computing resources under edge computing. The algorithm uses a centralized scheduling strategy that takes into account the overall matching between intelligent computing tasks and heterogeneous resources from two aspects: resource affinity and system load balancing. It can adjust the weights among these aspects to meet different application requirements. The results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the average response time by at least 10% and has a significant advantage regarding the system running time compared to the other comparative methods.}

	abstract = {Android pattern lock is one of the most popular unlocking mechanisms on the Android platform. In order to enhance the security of Android’s unlocking functionality, a number of researchers have tried to combine touch biometrics with the pattern lock. Several studies have reported adequate— even excellent—authentication results, but, unlike fingerprint-and face recognition-based authentication, no biometrics-enabled pattern lock exists in the Android marketplace. Furthermore, most studies of biometrics-enabled pattern locks were conducted in controlled lab environments. As such, in this work, our goal is to investigate and validate the performance of touch behavior-enabled Android pattern locks in a more practical scenario, in which users have to download the application and learn to use it by themselves (as was often the case during the pandemic). During the course of our investigation, we collected substantial data, namely, the properties provided by the Android API for motion events, as well as measurements that could be extracted from the devices’ sensors. Our investigation found that touch-enabled Android pattern locks could achieve an average equal error ratio of 23.5% for user authentication—without changing the process from the user’s perspective. Next, we modified the user experience such that each user would train the authenticator with different fingers, similar to fingerprint-based authentication. With this modification, an average equal error ratio of 13.5% was achieved.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable computation-intensive and latency-sensitive mobile applications by offloading tasks to proximal edge servers. This paper proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning framework called Transformer-based Federated Soft Actor-Critic (TFSAC) to address a joint computation offloading and resource scheduling problem in a CPU-GPU heterogeneous MEC network while preserving privacy. Specifically, a graph attention network (GAT) extracts high-dimensional features from the task dependency graph. Rather than simply averaging weights, TFSAC applies transformer encoders to learn contextual relationships between agents and enable selective aggregation of relevant knowledge during federated model training to preserve agents’ privacy. Experiments on real-world trace data demonstrate TFSAC’s superiority over benchmarks in maximizing quality-of-service (QoS) across configurations.}

	abstract = {Due to traditional network topologies’ static and homomorphic characteristics, attackers can rapidly expand their attack results through lateral movement (LM) attacks. Virtual Network View technology has emerged as an effective approach to disrupt attackers’ ability to detect and exploit network topologies during LM and can increase the difficulty of malicious activities. However, existing Virtual Network View deployS virtual views for each core asset, resulting in wasting of resource. To alleviate this problem, we propose a lightweight Virtual Network View deployment method called LWVN. First, the Location Centrality (LC) of the network nodes in the attack path is measured, the larger the LC is, the network node is more important and the more virtual network view costs we can invest. To further quantify the comprehensive impact of network nodes’ location centrality on high-value assets, we quantify the Assets’ Value(AV). Then, we model internal network risk and operational costs as constraints and find the optimal strategies for deploying a virtual network view. We define metrics for hidden capacity, detect capacity, and deployment cost to measure the effectiveness of deployment virtual network views. We conduct simulations to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of LWVN.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been actively employed in hardware security and have demonstrated remarkable performance. In particular, GNN models for hardware Trojan (HT) detection significantly outperform existing machine learning-based detection methods. However, GNNs have a potential vulnerability to membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample is used in the training dataset. In this paper, we investigate the threat of MIAs for GNN-based HT detection models. First, the MIA scheme for GNN-based HT detection models is established based on the basic MIA settings. The experimental results demonstrate that MIA for GNN-based HT detection can leak information about the HTs included in the training dataset with a 0.945 attack AUC score in the worst-case scenario. Based on this observation, we propose a defense method against MIA utilizing a domain generalization technique. The proposed defense method successfully mitigated the vulnerability of MIA and degraded the attack AUC score to 0.536 for the netlist level while maintaining the original HT detection performance.}

	abstract = {Federated learning provides the solution when multiple parties want to collaboratively train a machine learning model without directly sharing sensitive data. In Federated Learning, each party trains a machine learning model locally on its private data and sends only the models’ weights or updates (gradients) to an aggregator, which averages locally trained models into a new global model with higher effectiveness. However, the machine learning models, which have to be shared during the federated learning process, can still leak sensitive information about their training data through e.g. membership inference attacks. Differential Privacy (DP) can mitigate privacy risks in federated learning by introducing noise into machine learning models. In this work, we consider two approaches for achieving Differential Privacy in federated learning: (i) output perturbation of the trained machine learning models and (ii) a differentially-private form of stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). We perform an extensive analysis of these two approaches in several federated settings and compare their performance in terms of model utility and achieved privacy. We observe that DP-SGD allows for a better trade-off between privacy and utility.}

	abstract = {Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has numerous applications, including malware detection, vulnerability search, plagiarism detection, and patch identification. Recent studies have demonstrated that with the rapid progress of machine learning (ML) techniques, various BCSD approaches based on machine learning have exhibited stronger performance than traditional methods. However, current ML-based BCSD approaches tend to ignore the issue of training samples, and most ML-based BCSD approaches are based on supervised learning, which is suffered from the labelling difficulties. To mitigate these issues, we propose ConFunc: a function-level binary code similarity detection framework based on contrastive learning. Performance evaluation shows that ConFunc enhances the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Recall rates (Recall@1) of baseline models by fully harnessing the potential of the data. Additionally, ConFunc demonstrates stronger performance in scenarios with scarce data, achieving the baseline model’s performance on the entire dataset using only 10% of the complete dataset. In real-world patch identification and vulnerability search tasks, ConFunc consistently outperforms other baseline models in MRR and Recall@10.}

	abstract = {Insider threats present a formidable challenge to cybersecurity, as insiders possess the privileges and information necessary to execute diverse attacks. A comprehensive analysis of user behavior, including behavioral features, sequences, and inter-user relationships, is required for effective insider threat detection. However, few existing methods consider these features in an integrated manner, which could result in high false positives. To further improve the accuracy of insider threat detection, we propose a novel framework for insider threat detection based on a temporal graph convolutional network with data augmentation (referred to as TGCN-DA), which integrates the exploration of structural information among users and simultaneously captures the behavior temporal dependencies. In particular, we introduce an edge predictor to encode user structural information and strengthen intra-class edges among users based on the representation of users’ behavior. Additionally, the GCN with temporal feature mechanism is leveraged to learn dynamic changes in users’ behavior to capture behavior temporal dependence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TGCN-DA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher accuracy in the task of insider threat detection.}

	abstract = {Malware Knowledge Graph (MKG) serves as an essential auxiliary tool for malware detection and analysis. However, the construction of MKG faces several challenges, such as inadequate dataset quality, incomplete entity feature extraction, and the limitations imposed by deep learning techniques. To address these issues, we present an Efficient Framework for constructing a malware knowledge graph (EFwork). Firstly, we build a High-Quality Dataset (HQDataset) and introduce a metric for data quality assessment based on knowledge coverage, timeliness, and density. Subsequently, we develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that extracts character features, part-of-speech features, and word features from the data, leveraging deep learning models to identify malware-related entities. Finally, we implement a rule-based filtering mechanism, utilizing a comprehensive Rule Database to eliminate entities that do not conform to predefined rules. Experimental result shows that our HQDataset demonstrates superior data quality when compared to other open-source datasets. Furthermore, our NER model combined with our Rule Database outperforms existing models, achieving improvements of 0.67%, 0.74%, and 0.69% in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, respectively.}

	abstract = {The emergence of new network attacks, especially multi-step attacks which exhibit complex patterns, presents challenges to network security. Intrusion detection in network traffic is one of the core means to ensure network operation security. Traditional intrusion detection methods identify abnormal traffic by modeling the patterns of normal traffic. This strategy focuses on the spatial characteristics of data, ignoring the temporal characteristics of traffic evolution, and may not fully capture the patterns of multi-step network attacks. To address this problem, we propose a Temporal-Gated Graph Neural Network (TGGNN) framework based on graph clustering sampling. Firstly, each network traffic data is viewed as a graph node. We use hierarchical graph clustering methods to sample representative points and further construct local evolutionary structures with their temporally adjacent nodes. Then, we design a novel way of constructing graph data that balances both local and global aspects of network traffic data. Based on the GGNN (Gated Graph Neural Network), we designed a Temporal-Gated Mechanism in the information propagation part, emphasizing the learning of the local evolutionary structure of the graph. Furthermore, a bidirectional LSTM network is used to further enhance the learning of dynamic patterns in network traffic data. Experimental results based on the UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses the performance of four recent baselines but also eliminates the need for feature engineering by adopting an end-to-end approach.}

	abstract = {Trust is an important factor in the success of P2P networks. It is needed to ensure that nodes in the network can be trusted to behave honestly and to deliver on their promises (e.g sharing resources). While traditional reputation trust management systems (RTMS) such as BTrust or EigenTrust have proven effective, there is room for further enhancement by integrating advanced graph neural network (GNN) models. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance Trust Management Systems (TMS) by incorporating an Edge-Feature Attention Mechanism into the Edge Graph Neural Network (EGNN) model, which takes into account the direction of edges. The proposed GBTrust model is specifically designed for trust management in P2P networks, leveraging the interactions and relationships among peers. By incorporating the Edge-Feature Attention Mechanism, the model dynamically assigns importance to different edge features based on their relevance, thereby improving the discrimination of the importance of various neighbors and edge features in the network graph. The GBtrust model aims to provide more accurate and adaptive detection of malicious peers, thereby enhancing the overall security and reliability of P2P networks.}

	abstract = {The popularity of Ethereum as a platform for Stablecoin transactions (for example, AUDN) continues to rise. It is therefore paramount that the integrity and security of transactions within these decentralized systems are guaranteed. The intricate network of interactions occurring during the exchange of cryptocurrencies made the task of identifying specific transactions as fraudulent difficult because fraudulent behaviour can be concealed within legitimate smart contract operations. Leveraging the inherent structure and interconnectedness of Ethereum transactions, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework to address issues such as Frontrunning within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Constructing a knowledge graph representation of fraudulent Ethereum blockchain transactions, the proposed solution captures the relationships between addresses, transactions, and smart contracts and generates BotVictim recommendations based on Victim Receiver similarity scores exceeding 85%. These results are generated by excluding temporal transactions, a unique approach when examining the Ethereum network. Thus, our approach enables early detection and prevention of fraudulent activities, potentially safeguarding the interests of cryptocurrency users and mitigating potential financial losses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, its performance is compared against traditional fraud detection methods. The proposed solution demonstrates superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing is widely used in vulnerability mining because of its simplicity and efficiency. The fuzzing tool generates numerous testcases according to the mutation of the initial seed and inputs them into the program to be tested. At the same time, it monitors exceptions of the running program to find possible software bugs. In order to improve the performance of fuzzing, many researchers are committed to generating various initial testcases. However, at present, fuzzing testcase generation does not make full use of the information of testcases, the generation process is uncontrollable, and the generation effect is general. In view of the problems mentioned above, this paper proposes a testcase generation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The CWGAN-GP (Conditional Wasserstein Generic Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty) learns the format features of testcases, and generates testcases covering corresponding branches according to the input branch information. This paper conducted experiments on 6 common programs, and the experiments showed that compared to the initial training set, testcases generated by (C)WGAN-GP can extend the exploration of the program, and thus find more vulnerabilities. The CWGAN-GP model uses the branch vector in the training set as the condition to generate testcases, which can find more crashes and hangs, and improve the final fuzzing performance.}

	abstract = {Mining pools are fundamental infrastructure in most public blockchain networks that utilize Proof-of-Work consensus, ensuring that miners receive stable rewards and contribute to the computational power and storage of the network. However, mining pools also introduce centralization to the network, which increases the risk of security issues such as bribe attacks and censorship. To address the issue, this paper proposes a decentralized mining pool schema SSMP. Firstly, we distinguish between two aspects of centralization in mining pools, which are data determination, and block ownership, and suggest solutions to mitigate these issues. The proposed method utilizes anonymous broadcasting for a random leader selection schema to ensure each participating miner has an equal possibility to generate the block data. Additionally, a special threshold signature design prevents the leader miner from controlling the valid block solely of the mining pool through bribery. To validate our approach, we theoretically verify the security of the proposed method and compare it to traditional centralized mining pools. In summary, SSMP withholds the essential properties of the decentralized mining pools that maintain efficiency.}

	abstract = {As the integration of the Internet of Vehicles and social networks, vehicular social networks (VSNs) are promising to boost the realization of intelligent transportation system. Recently, vehicular data privacy has been paid increasing attention in data sharing. Searchable encryption as a promising cryptographic primitive can be utilized to ensure vehicular data confidentiality without sacrificing data searchability. However, most vehicular data sharing schemes rely on centralized cloud servers, which are vulnerable to the single point of failure and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose VehShare, a decentralized framework for privacy-preserving vehicular data sharing. We resort to the smart contract to implement a trusted platform for vehicles to share their encrypted vehicular data. To provide efficient access control, we design an authorization-based on-chain access control scheme with a lightweight cryptographic primitive. Moreover, we design a time synchronization-based non-interactive search token generation scheme to achieve efficient privacy-preserving search queries, while satisfying forward and backward security. We formally analyze the security of VehShare and extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of VehShare.}

	abstract = {Blockchain databases have been exploited in many applications to construct trust and share data among multiple participants. However, maintaining the entire blockchain locally will cause heavy communication and storage overhead for users with limited resources. Alternatively, the user could act as a light node that stores block headers only and delegates queries to full nodes that maintain the entire blockchain. However, introducing a light node raises several concerns about query integrity and privacy. In this paper, we propose EPPVChain, the first scheme that simultaneously achieves efficient, privacy-preserving and verifiable conjunctive query for blockchain databases. EPPVChain resorts to a novel symmetric cryptographic primitive named Symmetric Hidden Vector Encryption (SHVE), and deploys several new techniques to achieve the desired goals. In specific, we design a new SHVE-based authenticated data structure to support privacy-preserving verifiable conjunctive queries. We further propose two improved schemes to aggregate data records to optimize query performance. Finally, we propose a dual-chain key escrow protocol to securely escrow the symmetric key of SHVE without relying on any trusted third party. The security analysis and evaluation confirm EPPVChain’s ability to achieve query privacy and integrity with high efficiency.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, data are regarded as an intangible asset. In the data marketplace, data are treated as a commodity or service, data owners can gain economic revenue by selling their data ownership or data usage rights. However, the data marketplace is facing various threats and challenges, such as unauthorized data reselling, trade of bogus data, dishonest data ownership claims, and unreasonable revenue allocation. Particularly, in the process of data resale, the revenue allocation remains a challenge when the data are processed and resold in another format. To solve this problem, we propose a revenue allocation mechanism based on the referable Non-Fungible Token (rNFT) and Shapley value method. Firstly, we tokenize the data to NFT to ensure the data ownership is traceable; Secondly, we use rNFT to record the data lineage that ensures the data owner can participate in the revenue allocation when the data are resold; Finally, we calculate the contribution of each party by the Shapley value method to ensure fairness in revenue allocation. We implement a prototype of our scheme on Ethereum and evaluate it comprehensively. The test results indicate that our scheme can meet the performance requirements of the data marketplace and improve the revenue of data owners effectively.}

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) is now widely used to access network services due to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. To secure 5G communication, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization created the 5G-Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. Security evaluations have found a number of problems in the 5G-AKA, including a violation of perfect forward secrecy, a traceability attack, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. To address the shortcomings of 5G-AKA, several enhanced versions have been developed. However, it has been shown that either these versions are expensive or do not address security issues. Additionally, less effort is put into providing security when a user utilizes roaming mobile services while a malicious Serving Network (SN) is present. This paper introduces an authentication mechanism to handle the above issues. In addition to this, a handover mechanism is also designed for re-connection. The authentication and handover phase security assessment uses the mathematical model Real-Or-Random (ROR), AVISPA, and Scyther tool. Furthermore, the performance comparison depicts that the authentication and handover phase is more efficient than existing protocols. An assessment of the smart contract function’s cost and effectiveness is also provided.}

In this paper, we aim to re-purpose the energy by replacing the hash function with real-life problems having commercial utility. We propose Chrisimos, a useful Proof-of-Work where miners are required to find a minimal dominating set for real-life graph instances. A miner who is able to output the smallest dominating set for the given graph within the block interval time wins the mining game. Thus our protocol also realizes a decentralized minimal dominating set solver for any graph instance.}

	abstract = {In vehicular crowdsensing, vehicles frequently sense and transmit data, which poses a challenge in the privacy protection of vehicles. Existing privacy-preserving techniques often have a large computation or communication cost and the identity privacy protection is not well addressed. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based and privacy-preserving data collection scheme for vehicular crowdsensing, named BPDV. It aims to efficiently collect sensing data from vehicles while preserving the privacy of vehicles and requesters. BPDV assigns a sequence number to each vehicle that senses data by using a base-k 1-head random number, in order to protect the identity privacy. To save resources, the data from multiple vehicles are sent in one round of data collection with a well-designed "yield" mechanism. Additionally, RSUs store the sensing data on a blockchain to achieve decentralized and reliable data storage. Finally, extensive experiments show that BPDV has small computation and communication costs compared with other schemes, while providing the identity and data privacy preserving.}

However, existing digital identity management systems encounter various challenges, including difficulties in cross-domain authentication and interoperation, lack of credibility in identity authentication, and vulnerabilities in the security of identity data. Despite the attention blockchain technology has garnered in the field of digital identity management and the development of blockchain-based systems, these systems have not fully resolved the aforementioned problems. To address these issues and establish a secure and trustworthy digital identity management system, this paper proposes an effective model that integrates self-sovereign identity, oracle technology, and blockchain.

	abstract = {Digital certificates play a significant role in the current communication systems. However, with the limitations in the existing Certificate Management Frameworks (CMFs), such as single point of failure, the profound nature of existing certificates, and malicious Certificate Authorities (CAs), a novel framework is required to optimize certificate management. Even though blockchain is a popular approach in designing CMFs, they also failed to address all these limitations. There are no existing frameworks that distribute the functionality of the centralized CA to address these issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based, lightweight CMF while distributing the centralized certificate generation process among multiple parties. Certificate generation, validation, and revocation can be performed with our framework. We design the required secure communication protocols to deploy our framework in any blockchain. The proposed framework is implemented on top of a Hyperledger Fabric environment and performed a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the framework. Also, a formal security analysis for the proposed communication protocols is provided using known security verification methods such as BAN logic and the Scyther tool.}

	abstract = {A key feature for most collaborative applications is their ability to distinguish access rights to shared documents in a dynamic group of collaborators. To achieve high availability and avoid single points of failure, systems can replicate this access control policy across sites. Increasingly, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are used to this end. They embed conflict resolution strategies that take into account concurrent modifications to the policy but also to the document that it manages. However, few systems in the literature support multiple administrators, and those which do fall short of considering distributed applications where no node or group of nodes is central to its operation. To allow multiple concurrent edits of the policy in massively collaborative settings with no central server, we devise a specialized causal model that minimizes concurrency. Crucially our model allows to correct the document state in case operations have become unauthorized following a policy change. We apply our model to a CRDT replicating an access control policy with read and write rights on a collaborative document and admin rights on the policy. We end by studying flexible conflict resolution strategies, providing our underlying algorithms.}

	abstract = {When software services use cloud providers to run their workloads, they place implicit trust in the cloud provider, without an explicit trust relationship. One way to achieve such explicit trust in a computer system is to use a hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a coprocessor for trusted computing. However, in the case of managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings, there is currently no cloud provider that exposes TPM capabilities. In this paper, we improve trust by integrating a virtual TPM device into the Firecracker hypervisor, originally developed by Amazon Web Services. In addition to this, multiple performance tests along with an attack surface analysis are performed to evaluate the impact of the changes introduced. We discuss the results and conclude that the slight performance decrease and attack surface increase are acceptable trade-offs in order to enable trusted computing in PaaS offerings.}

	abstract = {Email remains a popular communication tool despite the emergence of new messaging systems, however, this popularity also attracts individuals with malicious intentions. Despite the efforts of current email filtering to keep up with the email-based threat vectors, unsolicited emails still keep reaching millions of targets. The current solutions are mainly focused on distinguishing ham from spam/phishing, leaving a gap in the identification and analysis of other unsolicited emails such as scams and adult content. In this paper, we present a study on the development of a more granular approach for sanitizing and categorizing unsolicited emails, specifically focusing on spam, phishing, scam and adult content. We design and evaluate a method for classifying unsolicited emails that can aid incident response teams in extracting contextual potential Threat Indicators (TIs). We train a machine learning language-agnostic classifier that achieves high accuracy with a novel set features such as attachments and TIs characteristics. Our results show that spam continues to drive a great portion of unsolicited emails together with phishing. Our analysis of URLs extracted from unsolicited emails revealed a surprising finding - over 80% of these TIs were not flagged as malicious by other threat feeds. This highlights the need for more effective methods of sharing malicious emails and their associated TIs.}

In particular, we evaluate and adapt a decision tree-based detection method that is not only explainable in the sense that the software’s internal processes can be explained to the decision maker, but we use the decision tree and the generated rules to understand exactly which attributes of a message are used for identification of the attack. This supports experts in the decision-making process and can also be used for automated countermeasure generation. We demonstrate the detection method on an Automotive Ethernet protocol that is being introduced in modern vehicles to replace or complement currently used bus communication.}

	abstract = {In modern datacenters, ensuring robust security access control mechanisms is of paramount importance to protect sensitive data and maintain operational integrity. However, one often overlooked factor that can significantly impact the effectiveness of access control systems is electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI refers to the disturbance caused by electromagnetic radiation on electronic devices, and it can have detrimental effects on the operation of security access control systems. This paper aims to analyze the impact of EMI on security access control in datacenter data halls and presents novel approaches to address this challenge. It explores the potential vulnerabilities introduced by EMI and proposes mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of access control systems in the face of EMI threats, including machine learning-based prediction, resilient access control architectures, EMI monitoring, EMI-resistant hardware development, and integrated security and EMI management. By understanding the intersection of EMI and security access control, datacenter operators can fortify their defenses and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of their data.}

	abstract = {We proposed a physical layer secure communication system for massive MIMO systems, utilizing channel entropy as the foundation. Our approach involves extracting a mask key and a flip key from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix. The mask key ensures the protection of the flip key during transmission. By applying a random flip to the constellation diagram of the transmitted message based on the flip key, we introduce a scrambling effect that cannot be deciphered by eavesdroppers. The flip key is securely delivered to the receiver, allowing for the proper demodulation of the message by eliminating the constellation flip. To address the computational burden associated with estimating massive MIMO channels, we employ precoding of the downlink channel guide signal in the system design. This reduces the channel estimation overhead at the terminal. However, it also creates an equivalent channel for the eavesdropper, enabling them to correctly decode the precoded signal and compromise communication security. Our scheme counters this by introducing the constellation diagram flipping, which cannot be extracted by eavesdroppers, thereby preventing correct decoding. Simulation experiments confirm even with a large number of antennas, the eavesdropper is unable to completely counteract the effects of constellation flipping, thus ensuring communication security. In summary, by exploiting the singular value decomposition and employing constellation diagram flipping, our physical layer secure MIMO communication system based on channel entropy achieves secure communication even in the presence of powerful eavesdroppers.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification as a physical layer authentication technique by leveraging devices’ unique hardware-level imperfections in transmitted signals has been considered as a potential complement to combat spoofing attacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight framework to identify long-term evolution (LTE) devices with intrinsic features extracted from Msg3. Channel-robust fingerprints from channel state information (CSI) in demodulation reference signal (DMRS) associated with physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) are obtained. These modulation features are combined with transient-on features that are obtained from the cyclic prefix (CP). A hybrid feature matrix is constructed and fed into a shallow long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which improves the identification accuracy compared to using single feature representation. We carry out extensive experiments with five LTE devices in real-world environment via a pseudo base station. The robustness of our proposed scheme is evaluated by cross-scenario training and testing. Thanks to the hybrid information-rich feature matrix as input of network, the classification accuracy 90.90% obtained at 25 dB when training in static but testing in dynamic scenarios demonstrates that our scheme is channel-robust in the presence of channel variations.}

	abstract = {Zero Trust security has recently gained attention in enterprise network security. One of its key ideas is making network-level access decisions based on trust scores. However, score-based access control in the enterprise domain still lacks essential elements in our understanding, and in this paper, we contribute with respect to three crucial aspects. First, we provide a comprehensive list of 29 trust attributes that can be used to calculate a trust score. By introducing a novel mathematical approach, we demonstrate how to quantify these attributes. Second, we describe a dynamic risk-based method to calculate the trust threshold the trust score must meet for permitted access. Third, we introduce a novel trust algorithm based on Subjective Logic that incorporates the first two contributions and offers fine-grained decision possibilities. We discuss how this algorithm shows a higher expressiveness compared to a lightweight additive trust algorithm. Performance-wise, a prototype of the Subjective Logic-based approach showed similar calculation times for making an access decision as the additive approach. In addition, the dynamic threshold calculation showed only 7% increased decision-making times compared to a static threshold.}

	abstract = {The increase in the number of IoT devices invading both private and professional spaces opens the way for different cyberattacks. Facing such threats requires new approaches capable of reading the context of a given situation and acting accordingly to protect the users’ data and applications. Logical-based approaches can be harnessed in this case because of the semantic dimension they model and implement. In this paper, we make use of an existential rule-based knowledge base to model an IoT environment and detect anomalies as inconsistencies inside the obtained logical system. Accordingly, we first introduce an algorithm for knowledge base rewriting into a context-based knowledge base. Then, we detail our contextualized derivation algorithm for inconsistency detection in such a logical system.}

	abstract = {Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a type of cyber attack that overwhelms a target server, service or network with a flood of malicious traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks have become a major threat to the security of computer networks and systems, and effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for detecting and mitigating these attacks. IDSs are used to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and can help detect and prevent DDoS attacks. Most IDSs are often designed to identify diverse types of attacks, but their efficacy can be limited when faced with attacks that exhibit extensive variations and sophisticated techniques, such as DDoS. In order to establish an effective IDS capable of identifying DDoS attacks, the acquisition of substantial volumes of labelled network data becomes crucial. This study aims to evaluate the performance of recent generative models in synthesising realistic tabular data to accurately emulate DDoS attack patterns. To achieve this, we used the CIC-DDOS2019 dataset, a comprehensive and modern collection of real-world DDoS attack scenarios. Leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, namely CTGAN, TVAE, and CopulaGAN, we synthesised realistic tabular data that emulated the characteristics and patterns observed in DDoS attack flow. We utilised various statistical metrics such as correlation scores, similarity and distance metrics, along with machine learning performance metrics, to quantitatively measure the performance of the generative models. The findings indicate that all three models have the ability to accurately emulate the patterns found in the real database, resulting in the generation of useful synthetic data. Specifically, among the classification methods used, the Random Forest method showed the most successful performance in detecting attacks with an accuracy of 99% when applied to the original dataset. In comparison, it achieved accuracy levels of 98%, 99%, and 93% when applied to datasets generated using the CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TVAE models respectively. It can be concluded that generative networks have the potential to be useful in synthesising tabular data and may contribute to the overall performance of existing and future IDS. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that to cover a wider spectrum of attacks, more specific adjustments may need to be applied both in the data preprocessing stage and in the model architectures.}

	abstract = {Network attack identification and analysis has been a difficult problem in cyberspace security research, and at present, the research on network attack identification based on deep learning models has achieved remarkable results. However, most of the models only use the temporal correlation of network traffic data to analyze, detect and warn the data, and do not make full use of the temporal correlation of the data, thus ignoring the topological information generated by the traffic in space. To address the above problems, this paper is attempt to use graph convolutional neural networks to solve the problem of network attack identification and analysis, and designs a deep learning model based on graph convolutional neural networks, which uses the correlation features between network flows to construct graph structure data, uses the spectral method in graph convolutional neural networks to transform the graph signal to the Fourier domain, and then performs convolutional operations in this domain, and through the learning of node features as well as topological information is learned to further enable the analysis and identification of known and unknown attacks. In this paper, we use the publicly available network traffic dataset UNSW-NB15_1, and the experimental results show that the detection accuracy of 9 types of network attacks is 99.43%; when "Analysis unknown attacks" are included in the test set, the detection accuracy of unknown attacks in it is 100%.}

	abstract = {By using traffic analysis attacks, attackers track users’ network traffic and analyze user behaviors, such as visited websites and online activities. Users’ personal privacy is at risk. Traffic obfuscation is a new way to protect privacy. Traffic obfuscation is commonly used in censory-circumvention systems to help Internet users bypass online censorship, but recent work has used it to disguise user traffic to evade adversary attacks. However, the current traffic obfuscation methods and rules are relatively simple, can not dynamically adapt to the network environment, and lack of uniform traffic feature similarity evaluation index. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network(GAN) model based on temporal convolutional network(TCN). TCN-GAN learns traffic features to achieve the purpose of disguising specific traffic as target traffic. At the same time, we provide the Measurement of Indiscernibility(MoI) for evaluating the difference between generated traffic features and real traffic features. Compared with the existing work, our experimental results show that in machine learning-based traffic analysis attacks, TCN-GAN has better performance on sample quality and mimicry effect, and MoI can be used as an effective index to evaluate the model generation effect.}

	abstract = {With the exponential rise of internet-connected devices, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has surpassed that of traditional IT devices. This proliferation in IoT adoption can be attributed to the growing demand for manufacturing automation and the desire for enhanced quality of life, leading to the production of smart devices in various industries. However, this rapid adoption has caught the attention of malicious actors, resulting in a significant increase in cyber-attacks targeting IoT devices. In response to this emerging threat landscape, research on IoT security has been active. Nevertheless, the lack of commercial tools specifically designed for IoT device security raises concerns about the ability of security research and adoption to keep pace with the rising number of malicious actors. To address this gap, this study focuses on introducing a novel mechanism for detecting malware in IoT devices. By conducting experiments, we demonstrate that using Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), complemented by physical features such as power consumption, can improve the current malware detection capabilities. Specifically, we employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Multi-Layer Perception Neural Networks (MLP) to achieve a remarkable detection accuracy of 95% within a timeframe of less than 10 seconds from infection.}

	abstract = {Location-based service (LBS) devices have enhanced daily life convenience but raised privacy concerns regarding user location data. For this, this research presents a novel approach to safeguard trajectory privacy through Similarity-based Trajectory Partitioning (STSM). The process begins by dividing trajectory equivalence classes based on distinct timestamps. Trajectory similarity is then assessed within each class using metrics such as Frechet distance, trajectory direction, and speed. Subsequently, a trajectory graph is constructed for each class, and the Dijkstra algorithm is applied to partition the graph using the k-subgraph method, effectively converting trajectory partitioning into graph partitioning. To meet publication requirements, Laplace noise is added to sensitive data linked to nodes and edges within the subgraph. Comparative experiments on real-world data confirm the efficacy, rationality, data availability, and privacy protection capabilities of the proposed trajectory partitioning algorithm, underscoring its superiority over alternative methods.}

	abstract = {DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide the most effective way to fight DNS cache poisoning attacks. Yet, very few DNS resolvers perform DNSSEC validation. Identifying such systems is non-trivial and the existing methods are not suitable for Internet-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel remote technique for identifying DNSSEC-validating resolvers. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify open resolvers by scanning 3.1 billion end hosts and request every non-forwarder to resolve one correct and seven deliberately misconfigured domains. We then build a classifier that discriminates validators from non-validators based on query patterns and DNS response codes. We find that while most open resolvers are DNSSEC-enabled, less than 18% in IPv4 (38% in IPv6) validate received responses. In the second step, we remotely identify closed non-forwarders in networks that do not have inbound Source Address Validation (SAV) in place. Using the classifier built in step one, we identify 37.4% IPv4 (42.9% IPv6) closed DNSSEC validators and cross-validate the results using RIPE Atlas probes. Finally, we show that the discovered (non)-validators actively send requests to DNS root servers, suggesting that we deal with operational recursive resolvers rather than misconfigured machines.}

	abstract = {DNS dynamic updates represent an inherently vulnerable mechanism deliberately granting the potential for any host to dynamically modify DNS zone files. Consequently, this feature exposes domains to various security risks such as domain hijacking, compromise of domain control validation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Originally devised without the implementation of authentication mechanisms, non-secure DNS updates were widely adopted in DNS software, subsequently leaving domains susceptible to a novel form of attack termed zone poisoning. In order to gauge the extent of this issue, our analysis encompassed over 353 million domain names, revealing the presence of 381,965 domains that openly accepted unsolicited DNS updates. We then undertook a comprehensive three-phase campaign involving the notification of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). Following extensive discussions spanning six months, we observed substantial remediation, with nearly 54% of nameservers and 98% of vulnerable domains addressing the issue. This outcome serves as evidence that engaging with CSIRTs can prove to be an effective approach for reporting security vulnerabilities. Moreover, our notifications had a lasting impact, as evidenced by the sustained low prevalence of vulnerable domains.}

While covert channels encapsulated in media protocols, particularly WebRTC-based encapsulation, have demonstrated effectiveness against passive traffic correlation attacks, their resilience against active correlation attacks remains unexplored, and their compatibility with Tor has been limited. This paper introduces TorKameleon, a censorship evasion solution designed to protect Tor users from both passive and active correlation attacks. TorKameleon employs K-anonymization techniques to fragment and reroute traffic through multiple TorKameleon proxies, while also utilizing covert WebRTC-based channels or TLS tunnels to encapsulate user traffic.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a crucial role in managing and controlling industrial assets. Due to their critical importance, adversaries are often highly motivated to target these systems, as a successful attack can disrupt the entire industry’s operations. In general, to improve the system’s security, proposed intrusion detection schemes often resort to traditional security mechanisms. As a consequence, due to their static nature, attackers can easily evade designed detection approaches. In light of this, this paper proposes a new dynamic network-based intrusion detection model for ICS, implemented in two phases. First, our scheme extracts network-related features to describe the current ICS environment behavior. Second, the security mechanisms are proactively selected based on the extracted network traffic behavior. As a result, our scheme can adjust the system’s configuration based on the current assessed event. Experiments on a new dataset, featuring over 14 attack categories targeting a SCADA system revealed that traditional detection methods face challenges in handling diverse attack categories. Conversely, our proposed model improved the average true-positive rates by up to 20% while also improving the range of detected attacks.}

	abstract = {The 5 th generation of mobile networks introduces a new Network Function (NF) that was not present in previous generations, namely the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF). Its primary objective is to provide advanced analytics services to various entities within the network and also towards external application services in the 5G ecosystem. One of the key use cases of NWDAF is mobility trajectory prediction, which aims to accurately support efficient mobility management of User Equipment (UE) in the network by allocating "just in time" necessary network resources. In this paper, we show that there are potential mobility attacks that can compromise the accuracy of these predictions. In a semi-realistic scenario with 10,000 subscribers, we demonstrate that an adversary equipped with the ability to hijack cellular mobile devices and clone them can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy from 75% to 40% using just 100 adversarial UEs. While a defense mechanism largely depends on the attack and the mobility types in a particular area, we prove that a basic KMeans clustering is effective in distinguishing legitimate and adversarial UEs.}

	abstract = {Zero trust networks have emerged as a promising solution to assure comprehensive security in network environments. Different from the traditional perimeter-based security approach, zero trust networks provide a robust and adaptable security framework which addresses the evolving threat landscape and enables organizations to protect their critical assets with a higher assurance of confidence. However, the centralized policy engine employed in current zero trust architectures (ZTA) would introduce bottlenecks and single points of failure (SPoF) for ZTA-based networks, thus hindering the scalability and efficiency as network size increases. This paper introduces a novel decentralized host-to-host authentication schema that enables consistent policy engine decisions in a pair-wise manner. By decentralizing the authentication process, the proposed schema effectively eliminates bottlenecks and single points of failure associated with centralized policy engines. The system incorporates a decentralized authentication ledger and a policy validation protocol to ensure the correct and consistent authentication across all network hosts. Through comprehensive tests and simulations, we compared our proposed novel model with the traditional zero trust network, in terms of the correctness, time complexity, and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of our decentralized approach and its potential for enhancing security in zero trust networks.}

	abstract = {In recent years the number of attacks on computer networks has increased exponentially due to the easy availability of sophisticated tools and attack techniques. These attacks are possible due to existing vulnerabilities in networking protocols. Most of the machine learning based intrusion detection systems proposed earlier, to mitigate these attacks, consider training a model for the group of attacks, which doesn’t consider protocol-specific properties into account and is biased toward attacks where most of the data is available. In this paper, we propose protocol aware unsupervised method based on an autoencoder-based learning approach to detect the attack in network flows by training the model using only normal traffic and using reconstruction error as the parameter to classify the attack event. Our proposed method is based on building protocol aware model by combining individual protocol-specific encoders and learning the protocol channel importance using attention mechanism. We perform various experiments on different recent datasets like CICDDoS2019, and CICIDS2018, and experimental results show that the proposed protocol aware model performs better than the non-protocol aware method.}

	abstract = {Emerging energy management systems (EMS) involve devices and services provided by multiple stakeholders. In order to improve the interoperability of these systems, state of the art efforts propose an interoperability middleware that mediates the communication between end-user applications and EMS components. The potential lack of trust between the different stakeholders raises the need for fine-grained access control mechanisms. However, extending the middleware to support access control in a secure and usable way is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a solution that achieves fine-grained authorization using Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Our solution leverages VC properties to enable end-users to combine authorizations issued by different entities. Additionally, our solution integrates a cloud-based VC wallet that hides the authorization process from end-user applications, thus facilitating interoperability among EMSes and the development of new, secure applications.}

	abstract = {The data-driven deep learning methods have brought significant progress and potential to intrusion detection. However, there are two thorny problems caused by the characteristics of intrusion data: "multi-type features" and "data imbalance". The former means that forcefully and improperly transforming intrusion features from distinct metric spaces can result in semantic loss and noise. The latter indicates that the intrusion data is imbalanced in quantity and quality due to its complex spatial distribution. We propose a Hybrid Framework for Multi-type and Imbalance Data (HF-Mid) to address the above two problems. Firstly, we divide the intrusion features into equivalent and non-equivalent groups, and then embed them sequentially using Supervised Paragraph Vector-Distributed Memory (SPV-DM), which excels at modeling co-occurrence relationships, and Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is suitable for modeling non-linear relationships, thereby solving the "multitype features" problem. Secondly, we adopt a low-noise collective matrix factorization (CMF) model to fuse the two obtained features for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we employ a multiple classifier to detect intrusion. During the classifier training stage, we design a genetic algorithm-based proportional sampling method to select high-quality samples in each training batch. thus addressing the "data imbalance" problem. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework exhibits an overall improvement of 5.9% and 1.5% in terms of accuracy and false positive rate on average, respectively.}

	abstract = {Malware is a significant threat to the security of computer systems and networks, requiring sophisticated techniques to analyze its behavior and functionality for detection. Due to their rapid evolution, traditional signature-based malware detection methods have become ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware. One of the most promising techniques to overcome the limitations of signature-based detection is using control flow graphs (CFGs). CFGs leverage the structural information of a program to represent the possible paths of execution as a graph, where nodes represent instructions and edges represent control flow dependencies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms extract these features from CFGs and classify them as malicious or benign. In this survey, we aim to review some state-of-the-art methods for malware detection through CFGs using ML, focusing on the different ways of extracting, representing, and classifying. Specifically, we present a comprehensive overview of various CFG features and different ML algorithms applied to CFG-based malware detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges and limitations of these approaches, as well as suggest potential solutions to address persisting open problems and promising future directions for research in this field.}

We consider a repository of de-identified medical data that is stored in the custody of a Healthcare Institution. The identifying information which is stored separately can be associated with the medical information only by a subset of users referred to as custodians. This paper intends to secure the process of associating identifying information with sensitive medical information. We also enforce the responsibility of the custodians by maintaining an immutable ledger documenting the events of such information identification. The paper proposes a scheme for constructing ledger entries that allow the custodians and patients to browse through the entries which they are associated with.

	abstract = {Text-based passwords have dominated online user authentication for decades and have been constantly targeted by harvesting and phishing attacks. Password managers have become one of the most popular methods for helping users securely manage their online passwords. However, existing pass-word managers are often assumed to be used on trusted devices. To help with automatic sign-in on untrusted computers for kiosk browsing, we propose CamPass, a secure camera-based password manager. It has three components: an application on a user’s trusted mobile device, a browser extension for online sign-in on an untrusted computer, and a trusted key distribution center for the secure exchange of encryption keys. CamPass transmits credentials via QR codes from the mobile device to the browser extension for filling out login forms, and exchanges encryption keys among its three components on the network. CamPass is resistant to man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, message forgery, and replay attacks. It also protects users from keyloggers and phishing attacks. CamPass is a rational design to make web users’ online experiences more convenient and secure.}

	abstract = {With the increasing development of deepfake in facial editing and the easy accessibility of image and video content on the internet, the security risks of spreading false personal information through social media platforms are becoming increasingly serious. The harm caused by deepfake includes spreading false information, pornography, financial fraud, privacy breaches, and security system damage. To address these security issues, it is necessary to strengthen the detection and defense of deepfake. Current research mainly focuses on the detection of deepfake images and videos. In recent years, some work has proposed using the method of generating adversarial samples to deal with the malicious operations of GAN networks in deepfake. And it has proposed different single perturbation fusion methods to generate universal adversarial watermarks that can defend against modifications by multiple models. However, all of these works generate single-step watermarks using gradient-based methods, which cannot accurately control the required perturbation strength, resulting in large errors and more irrelevant information compared to the original image after superimposing the watermark. To solve this problem, we propose an optimized adversarial face deepfake watermark and measure the protection success rate and defense performance of this method on single and multiple models. From the extensive experimental results, we find that the perturbation generated by the Optimization-based method can successfully generate smaller perturbations while ensuring a high protection success rate, making the adversarial samples closer to the original samples. It can also be applied to different types of models and loss functions, accurately generating perturbation strength, and has a wider range of applicability.}

Leveraging the complex number encryption capability of homomorphic encryption algorithms, we introduce a complex neural network and design every modules of it, to accommodate the properties and characteristics of homomorphic encryption. Considering the relatively slow computation speed of homomorphic encryption, we employ convolution decomposition to reduce the cost of computational of the network, effectively minimizing computational time while preserving network performance. We have tested our proposed method and found that it significantly accelerates computation speed with minimal performance sacrifice when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, thereby better balancing network performance and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Focused crawling is a technique used to retrieve topic-specific information from the internet by directing the crawling search towards a particular subset of webpages. This approach can significantly improve the discovery and extraction of relevant cybersecurity content, thereby enhancing the precision, recall, and overall relevancy of the collected data. The current state-of-the-art focused crawlers depend on basic keyword matching and phrase matching, or they utilize complex logic, all while demonstrating only average efficiency in identifying relevant webpages. In this study, the implementation of a semantic-driven focused crawler is carried out, expressly constructed for discovering pages that contain Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). The proposed method introduces a holistic and creative approach that seamlessly integrates keyword-based and link-based strategies with the power of LASER embeddings, enabling a more nuanced understanding of web content and boosting the efficiency and effectiveness of focused crawling for web page classification. To measure the accuracy and efficiency of the focused crawler, a transformer-based large language model (LLM) classifier has been trained, functioning as a web page classifier to identify the relevance of the pages that the crawler has processed. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is assessed based on two main metrics: harvest rate and irrelevance ratio. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies, achieving an average harvest rate of 0.87 and an irrelevance ratio of 0.13.}

We initially find that models can achieve near state-of-the-art accuracy on SVD benchmarks regardless of their ability to learn Code Execution Tasks. However, these models fail to generalize well across SVD benchmarks. The results indicate a bias in the datasets that allows models to predict non-SVD signals. Under the theory that different collection methods will reduce biases, we investigate combining the SVD datasets. When trained on combined datasets, SVD accuracy is reduced but correlation with Code Execution Task accuracy improves. Our contributions are (1) using a reversed curriculum learning to evaluate model capabilities, (2) demonstrating the criticality of code execution understanding to machine learning–assisted software vulnerability detection, (3) evidence that improved diversity of SVD datasets will lead to improved accuracy and generalizability, (4) and benchmarks of recent models across multiple SVD datasets.}

	abstract = {The security of cloud-based databases is a crucial topic in current research. The primary solutions are focused on access control and data encryption. A central challenge these solutions face is navigating the balance between system security and operational efficiency. However, individualized data privacy requires fine-grained data protection at columns/rows or individual elements. In existing fine-grained resource or policy protection methods, resource access predominantly uses a traversal method, leading to a linear growth in time overhead. In response to these issues, this paper presents a fine-grained access control mechanism based on search trees. This mechanism provides element-level resource protection and accelerates policy search using an index tree, thereby reducing the time overhead of the fine-grained access control system. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism achieves element-level resource protection while maintaining low-performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Ransomware of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) type are very sophisticated and often have a contingency plan of attack in case they are discovered while the attack is in progress. Due to the ever-changing trait of such APT-type ransomware, an intelligent and robust intrusion detection system (IDS) is the need of the hour and in this paper, we put forward machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) based intrusion detection systems. We utilize a commercial simulator to run different real-world ransomware attacks to create, for the first time, a dataset for APT-type ransomware research. Then, we develop multiple IDSes by training ML models like support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (GB) decision trees, random forest (RF), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and an NLP model called BERT, on this dataset. With our intelligent IDS, we could precisely distinguish the system calls of processes spawned by ransomware from legitimate system calls. We compare the different intrusion detection systems developed using the six aforementioned models. The IDS using the NLP BERT model achieves the best accuracy of 99.98%, and the IDS using the Naive Bayes Classifier achieves an accuracy of 98.55%. Furthermore, we discuss the tradeoffs of these models for designing an intelligent IDS. The advancement in cyber attacks, especially ransomware-based attacks, necessitates this upgrade in IDS which is essential for a strong defense.}

	abstract = {Research shows that phishing emails often utilize persuasion techniques, such as social proof, liking, consistency, authority, scarcity, and reciprocity to gain trust to obtain sensitive information or maliciously infect devices. The link between principles of persuasion and social engineering attacks, particularly in phishing email attacks, is an important topic in cyber security as they are the common and effective method used by cybercriminals to obtain sensitive information or access computer systems. This survey paper concluded that spear phishing, a targeted form of phishing, has been found to be specifically effective as attackers can tailor their messages to the specific characteristics, interests, and vulnerabilities of their targets. Understanding the uses of the principles of persuasion in spear phishing is key to the effective defence against it and eventually its elimination. This survey paper systematically summarizes and presents the current state of the art in understanding the use of principles of persuasion in phishing. Through a systematic review of the existing literature, this survey paper identifies a significant gap in the understanding of the impact of principles of persuasion as a social engineering strategy in phishing attacks and highlights the need for further research in this area.}

	abstract = {Security infrastructures heavily rely on public key cryptography. With the emergence of quantum threats, NIST has been standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber. However, a major challenge in public-key cryptography is establishing a secure connection between verifiable information of specific entities and public keys. Traditionally, this challenge is addressed through Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). Nevertheless, the current PKIs suffer from security and performance issues due to the requirement of central authorities. In this paper, we propose Inj-Kyber, a novel algorithm enhancing Kyber with information injection. Inj-Kyber achieves robust entity-key binding by injecting verifiable information into public keys while ensuring equivalent security to Kyber. Additionally, we showcase the applicability of Inj-Kyber through Bio-KEM, a KEM framework leveraging Inj-Kyber and biometric authentication to protect public keys via biometric information binding.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Internet of Things applications face serious data and privacy protection vulnerabilities. To address some of the data protection and privacy issues, in this work we propose a new design for the self-encryption method based on a cryptographic-puzzle algorithm, that includes the generation of multiple secret keys, derived from the plaintext. As the ciphertext is constructed from several chunks of encrypted data, the absence of one of the decryption keys or one of the encrypted chunks renders recovery of the original plaintext nearly impossible. As security improvement upon to other related work proposing self-encryption, the plaintext is mixed with random values in order to use a technique known as Privacy Amplification. Privacy Amplification is achieved by applying cryptographic functions from which SHA-2 family is based on. Implementations of our design are also provided, and they are enabled for standalone and back-end execution systems. Furthermore, performance and security results and comparisons with previous related work are also provided. The security analysis confirms the use of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash family for Privacy Amplification.}

	abstract = {Document retrieval plays an essential role in many real-world applications especially when the data storage is outsourced. Due to the great advantages offered by cloud computing, clients tend to outsource their personal data to remote servers maintained by external service providers. This raises serious privacy concerns about outsourced data because such providers are usually considered untrusted entities. The majority of previous schemes of document similarity search share the same limitation: they focus mainly on static collections. Dynamic searchable schemes (DSE) allow adding or removing documents at the expense of more leakage than static schemes. To thwart certain attacks, DSE schemes should support forward privacy property, which ensures that newly added documents cannot be related to previously issued search queries. We design and implement dynamic secure similarity search schemes with forward privacy for textual documents utilizing simhash method for hamming similarity. Our scheme provides an efficient search time and a sufficient level of privacy. To show the practicality of our proposed scheme, we performed excremental results with large document collections.}

	abstract = {The ability of IoT devices to sense and share various physical parameters plays a key role in a smart system. Along side benefits, it also bears the potential to cause a breach of privacy for the users of the smart-systems. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving computation for distributed systems either extensively use highly complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of message passing among the devices through secure channels. However, for the resource-constrained IoT devices, which compose a significant fraction of the smart-systems, the existing solutions for privacy-preserving computation strategies does not fulfill the current requirements. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel real-time lightweight strategy LiPI for Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation in low-power IoT systems. LiPI uses lightweight distributed and collaborative data obfuscation, which substantially minimizes the computation requirements. In addition, it exploits the recent advances in Synchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols to efficiently fulfill the communication requirements too, making it efficient to work in real-time. Furthermore, LiPI also avoids dependency on any trusted third party. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in both simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates that our strategy achieves the goal at least 51.7% faster and consumes 50.5% lesser energy compared to the existing state-of-the-art strategies.}

	abstract = {Multichannel secret sharing protocols generalize performance-oriented multipath protocols like Multipath TCP [1], exploiting path diversity to bolster confidentiality, data integrity, or availability in addition to throughput. The appropriate balance between these security and performance properties is not fixed; rather, it shifts over time depending on a variety of factors, including user preference and risk assessment. In this paper, we present a multichannel secret sharing protocol which provides a general mechanism for altering security parameters in response to current defensive priorities. This work includes a novel share-buffering algorithm to address the disconnect between the assumptions of TCP congestion control and the behavior of multichannel protocols with several threads. We run a series of simulated attacks against our new protocol, demonstrating the effect of changing each parameter in the presence of attackers of various strengths. Our results also show that, as a result of the new share buffer, a multithreaded implementation now achieves over 90% of the theoretical maximum. This work paves the way to adaptive multichannel security for data in transit, layering a flexible and practical "second factor" atop conventional encryption techniques.}

	abstract = {The everlasting fight between security researchers and ransomware authors, including cyber criminals who leverage ransomware to cripple organizations worldwide, has continued to evolve as novel techniques are used to evade ransomware detection. The victim not only endures paramount financial loss from business downtime for several days and/or paying ransom to regain control of their environment but also becomes at risk of being exposed to the stolen digital assets out on the Internet. To tackle these threats against ransomware, our research project aims to identify (1) structural similarities among 2,436 cryptographic Windows ransomware samples per calendar year between 2017 and 2021 and (2) structural dissimilarities against 3,014 benign applications using machine learning classifiers. We base our analysis on PE metadata for similarity analysis and binary classification tasks. With the Cosine Index, we capture 71% – 87.80% and 66% – 82.30% of similarities based on imports and function names feature spaces, respectively. On the other hand, after designing four experimental settings, Random Forest outperforms other applied classifiers by achieving 91.75%, 91.99%, 90.47%, and 91.05% at best for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, respectively, for ransomware detection.}

	abstract = {The continuous emergence of malicious software poses a serious threat to computer security. Traditional malware detection approaches rely on single or limited datas for feature extraction, which may not fully capture the effective information provided by different information dimensions in PE files. Furthermore, attackers always employ code obfuscation and evasion techniques to interfere with detection results while still maintaining malicious intent. To address these issues, we designed and implemented a model, called MFFCL. Firstly, our approach uses data feature fusion technology to mine as much effective information as possible from execution records, forming the original dataset. Secondly, to effectively resist code obfuscation, we utilize supervised contrastive learning to constitute software features from high-dimensional space. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that MFFCL can detect malware with high accuracy and stability. Specifically, during training, MFFCL achieved a precision rate of 97.25% and a recall rate of 94.1%.}

	abstract = {Best practices of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are being intensively explored in academia and industry. Reusable solutions obtained from best practices are generalized as architectural patterns for systematic analysis and design reference, which significantly boosts productivity and increases the dependability of future implementations. For security-sensitive projects, architects make architectural decisions with careful consideration of security issues and solutions based on formal analysis and experiment results. In this paper, we propose a model-driven security analysis framework for analyzing architectural patterns of SSI systems with respect to a threat model built on our investigation of real-world security concerns. Our framework mechanizes a modeling language to formalize patterns and threats with security properties in temporal logic and automatically generates programs for verification via model checking. Besides, we present typical vulnerable patterns verified by SecureSSI, a standalone integrated development environment, integrating commonly used pattern and attacker models to practicalize our framework.}

	abstract = {Anti-forensics attempts to prevent the forensic investigator from analyzing the evidence by tampering with it. Artifact wiping is one of the prominently used anti-forensic approaches. In artifact wiping, the adversaries use wiping tools to wipe the traces of their activity left behind as a part of their execution. Thereby leading to the investigation of incomplete and unreliable evidential artifacts. On the other hand, a wiper attack is one of the most destructive cyberattacks as it causes permanent damage to the data by overwriting the original content. It has serious consequences on national and international security. These attacks have targeted government organizations, financial institutions, and energy sectors in recent years, causing loss of sensitive data, significant downtime, financial losses, and reputation damage. In both scenarios, detecting wiping to mitigate its effect becomes crucial. In this paper, we detect wiper attacks using the Sequence of System-calls (SoS) and information theory metrics and analyze the behavior of the benign and wiping process. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed model by simulating the wiping process on a system and detect wiping. The results show that the proposed model detects wiping accurately.}

Even though new protocols are considering built-in security (e.g. OPC UA) there is still a struggle for assuring interoperability and interconnectivity in the IoT era while dealing with resource constrained devices. This paper attempts to implement and evaluate a solution for assuring the authenticity and integrity of the data transmitted through OPC UA protocol in a client- server communication based on ECC as an alternative to the existing implemented solution which uses RSA. We choose ECC since it can achieve similar level of security as RSA for smaller key size and in order to respond to the limited memory and resource constrained elements part of an industrial system. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate through measurements the performance of different ECC key sizes in respect to the latency introduced by each cryptographic operation.}

	abstract = {With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), there come opportunities to connect people, data, and objects, bringing dynamic changes in our way of living. At the same time, the presence of sensors and other devices around us has created a leaky ecology that is webbed. It has turned into a risk for the users and causes worry about how widely it could be adopted. Numerous projects have been put up in a similar vein, creating innovations to improve security. But, conventional cryptographic solutions are difficult to embed as these IoT devices have limited resources. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs), particularly in resource-restraining devices, have shown to be valuable for developing authentication protocols. In this work, we propose a PUF-based authentication mechanism for IoT devices. This authentication protocol also performs the key exchange between the two nodes, with the server in between. The security features of the proposed mechanism are verified using AVISPA tool.}

	abstract = {The advancement of mobile technologies and their ability to utilize the Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately locate their substantial number of users, prompt Location-Based Services (LBS) significantly. Ride-sharing is a popular means of transportation that utilizes LBS. With the rapid development of smart cities and their impact on addressing the critical issues of urban life such as transportation, we can safely assume that the autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be a desired way of transportation in the near future. Therefore, the ride sharing service (RSS) providers will need to arrange their services via AVs. However, a user who wants to use a RSS has to submit their trip data (which contains location data) to the service provider. On one hand, the popularity of RSSs makes them an attractive target for cyber-attacks, and on the other hand, multiple studies show that a user’s location data can reveal sensitive information about that user. In this paper, we present a practical ride-sharing protocol for AVs that preserves both anonymity and location privacy of the users. Most of the previous works on the topic, does not provide security against malicious server and/or clients. Moreover, the previously proposed protocols rely on additional entities (e.g., a trusted third party) to satisfy the objectives of their protocols. In the presence of the malicious entities, our proposed protocol guarantees the security and privacy of the server and the clients, without relying on any additional parties. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first scheme that satisfies perfect location privacy. We evaluate the performance of our protocol in a realistic setting and demonstrate its feasibility in the real life application areas, i.e., the protocol only requires 20 milliseconds to process and respond to 1000 simultaneous ride-sharing requests. Moreover, we propose a novel private sum aggregation (PSA) scheme that is designed for the use-cases where the private elements are chosen from a limited set. We believe that our novel PSA scheme may be of independent interest.}

	abstract = {The privacy and security of users are increasingly threatened due to the rising frequency of malware assaults. Both Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDSes) and Antivirus software rely on signature-based or anomaly-based techniques for malware detection. However, the escalating diversity and sophistication of malware pose significant obstacles. In this research, we introduce EMD-SCS, an early malware detection methodology, employing sonification and system call sequence analysis. In our methodology, we interpret an executing program/process as a sequence of system calls, leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to hold a record of preceding system calls within this chain, consequently facilitating the prediction of future calls. After this prediction phase, the BLEU and hamming distance scores are utilized to classify the system call sequence. Importantly, these results are attained by analyzing just a small segment of the data for early prediction, which is crucial for a sonification-based approach as it enables us to notify administrators in advance of potential threats. This early warning system would allow admins to protect the host before a potential compromise. EMD-SCS uses sonification to convey the prediction outcomes using natural and animal sounds, offering a broader monitoring scope than visual observation. Evaluation results from the ADFA-LD dataset suggest that EMD-SCS surpasses prior techniques in early malware detection with an accuracy of 91.2%, a detection rate of 87.7%, and a false-positive rate of 15.3%, achieved by only processing 40% of the input system call sequences before they infiltrate the host.}

	abstract = {Financial institutions collect, control and process sensitive data, either personally or commercially. These data are vital for many purposes, including business process optimisation, tailored services to individuals and organisations, and preventing fraud or other misuse of the financial system. While an institution’s information is valuable, its power is amplified when combined with other data stored in different organisations horizontally, vertically or in a governance role. However, sharing data between organisations becomes difficult for commercial, legal and regulatory reasons. Privacy-enhancing Technologies (PETs) are becoming a practical solution for secure and private information sharing. One such PET, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), allows the computation over encrypted data and thus protects the confidentiality of the information while increasing its utility. This paper investigates the current position regarding the use of HE in the financial sector by analysing the LexisNexis news archive using statistical instruments on NLP and ML techniques. Our results show that the financial sector has gained momentum in discussing privacy-enhancing technology over the last few years. The discussion around this new field highlights a constantly growing match in capitalising market readiness to technology readiness.}

	abstract = {There has been a steady increase in malware targeting Linux-based systems. With the proliferation of embedded IoT devices and cloud architectures that use Linux or Unix-based Operating Systems, this trend is expected to grow. Most modern Linux distributions include a configurable and queryable userspace component for security auditing with auditd (audit daemon) subsystem. In a multi-user, enterprise environment, these audit events are typically collected in a centralized repository as a source for threat detection and Incident response. Attack techniques used by malicious programs such as process injection and memory corruption are commonly seen in fileless malware, insider threats, and zero day attacks. Such attacks are difficult to detect through traditional signature-based methods since there are no known, discernible indicators of compromise. This study proposes a novel method of using Linux process overlay (execve) audit logs to identify threats from malicious executable and shellcode, with Machine Learning. Our study proposes a methodology that uses a Sparse Autoencoder Deep Learning model to effectively detect these security threats as anomalies, with an accuracy of over 95 percent. We suggest this approach as a feasible enterprise solution to identify Linux malware and detect security threat anomalies by leveraging native Linux audit logging capabilities.}

	abstract = {Data recovery for forensic analysis of both hard drives and solid state media presents its own unique set of challenges. Hard drives face mechanical failures and data fragmentation, but their sequential storage and higher success rates make recovery more feasible. Solid State Drives (SSDs), with no moving parts and no data fragmentation, provide faster access to data but may pose challenges due to wear levelling and data retention issues. This project examines the challenges of data recovery between hard drives and solid-state media and compares them against each other. This was achieved by running several tests on four types of storage media, one of which is a hard drive, and the others are different types of solid-state media. The tests indicated that most SSDs perform as expected; however, the Intel Optane drive retained a much higher percentage of deleted data than the other drives. Despite this, all of the evaluated SSDs retained less deleted data than the hard drive. It can therefore be argued that traditional forensic processes are incapable of recovering as much deleted data from solid-state media and that these processes must be re-examined.}

At this frontier, we should be responsible for enhancing our understanding of user privacy concerns and enabling privacy by design. This study uncovers and compares individual privacy concerns within health applications. Our scenario-based approach considers 432 different health application data exchanges. Participants (n=189) assessed 27 unique scenarios across three categories: data type, data sharing, and data retention. The findings show user concerns in the three categories, most prominently, data sharing. From this position, we propose design approaches to improve user awareness and control of health application data. We discuss the finding’s implications, including pre-emptive and predictive strategies for health app developers.}

	abstract = {With the increasing pervasiveness of software solutions, which are joining cyber-physical spaces and forming partnerships with humans, the importance of the trustworthiness of these systems is growing. At the same time, however, trustworthiness assurance is becoming extremely difficult in these complex ecosystems due to the high autonomy, unpredictability and limited controllability of their individual players. To mitigate safety risks for humans, these Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems (e.g., Smart Cities) might require their member systems (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles) to execute software modules called Smart Agents to ensure safe coordination among themselves. Unfortunately, this technology is currently in its very early development with many challenges ahead. Namely, there is no guaranteed way of ensuring that these agents run on the right piece of hardware, with the right privileges required to fulfill their roles, and without the execution environment tampering with their instructions. This way, the host system (e.g., the Autonomous Vehicle we need to control for the sake of the safety of other ecosystem members) can escape the actual safety measures to be enforced. In this paper, we are proposing a novel software architecture that focuses on the detection of instruction tampering and privileged access in Smart Agents, and this way support the vision of trustworthy and safe evolution of Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems.}

	abstract = {Social networking services (SNS) are often the subject of privacy concerns. Hence users should be careful not to post content with unacceptable privacy risks. In order to correctly determine whether a privacy risk is acceptable, the perceived privacy risk must match the actual privacy risk. One of the objectives of this study is to investigate whether the recognition of privacy risk is consistent with the actual privacy risk. This study investigates the posters ’recognition of privacy risk from postings that infer their attributes and regrets about their actions. On the other hand, privacy information can also be leaked from other people’s posts, to which people respond with "Liking" or "Retweeting." Existing methods for analyzing their posts to suppress their posts may not be effective if personal information is leaked from the responses to the contents of others’ posts. In addition, users may be less likely to perceive the risk of privacy information leakage from responses to the contents of others ’ posts than from their posts. Therefore, this study tests the hypothesis that there is a difference between the users’ recognition of privacy risk in posting by themselves and that caused by responding to contents of others’ posts and evaluates the difficulty of recognizing privacy risk caused by responding compared with that by posting.}

	abstract = {The dispersion of resource authorization across various authorization systems raises the complexity and inconsistency of authorization management. Therefore, the pursuit of a unified resource authorization management system is necessary. Most widely used authorization systems are based on centralized services with a single delegation pattern. These authorization systems can be easily compromised, leading to permissions tampering, and are unsuitable for complex usage scenarios. We propose a decentralized authorization system that provides flexible delegation called FlexAuth. We first define a decentralized data storage layer based on blockchain, using smart contracts to implement data writing and resolving, preventing data from being tampered with. On top of this, we implement active and passive delegation patterns of authorization services. We allow users to delegate permissions actively. Also, FlexAuth enables them to respond to authorization requests passively by making flexible and expressive access control policies based on relation-ships and attributes, using the proposed Hybrid Access Control Model (HACM). Furthermore, all delegations in FlexAuth are transitive. Finally, through analysis and experiments, we validate the usability and efficiency of FlexAuth. To our knowledge, FlexAuth is the first decentralized authorization system with transitive delegation in active and passive patterns, achieving flexible delegation.}

	abstract = {The widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has also brought about issues such as fake information and threats to resource security. Trust management, by evaluating the trustworthiness of entities and the trust relationships between entities, aims to identify false messages, detect malicious nodes, and maintain network security. Compared to other security techniques, trust management places more emphasis on entity behavior and motives. This paper quantifies entity trustworthiness using weighted Beta distributions and detects malicious nodes based on this quantification. To comprehensively assess the trust status of entities, four conditions are designed to collect detailed information about the entities and their surrounding environment. Each condition forms a Beta distribution, and the weighted sum of these four conditions’ distributions represents the entity’s trustworthiness value. The paper also analyzes the weight allocation and resistance to malicious attacks of the proposed trust evaluation mechanism, providing corresponding countermeasures against attacks. Furthermore, simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Compared to other trust evaluation mechanisms, the proposed approach considers a broader range of information about entities. Moreover, in practical applications, the types of conditions can be increased or decreased to accommodate complex and dynamic environments.}

However, performing edge collaborative processing on transmission line image data may result in serious privacy breaches. To address this issue, we propose a secure single-stage detection model called SecYOLOv7 that preserves the privacy of object detecting. Based on secure multi-party computation (MPC), a series of secure computing protocols are designed for the collaborative execution of Secure Feature Contraction, Secure Bounding-Box Prediction and Secure Object Classification by two non-edge servers. Performance evaluation shows that both computational and communication overhead in this framework as well as calculation error significantly outperform existing works.}

In order to succeed in running a darknet marketplace, operators need to earn trust from the users of their platform. However, in anonymous environments like darknet marketplaces, it can be difficult to determine which technical measures or policies intended to build trust can actually be trusted.In this paper we evaluate the trustworthiness of the darknet marketplace UnderMarket 2.0. By scraping and analyzing data from the marketplace, we reveal that numerous fraud indicators exist. We show in a further evaluation that UnderMarket 2.0 intentionally uses various measures to gain trust in order to defraud customers.}

This paper presents the design and implementation of a web-based application that offers standard therapy demonstrations, schedules specific therapy sessions, guides patients through exercises in the absence of a doctor and evaluates their performance upon completing the therapy. The web application also features messaging and video conferencing functionalities for seamless doctor-patient communication. Furthermore, the application facilitates doctor-patient allocation, follow-up appointments, and the option to consult with additional healthcare professionals.

	abstract = {This paper underscores the crucial role of video anonymization in smart ports, were data privacy and security hold critical importance. It introduces the Matrix Platform, specifically designed for smart environments, and highlights its strong video anonymization capabilities. The platform employs advanced Video Anonymization techniques to effectively balance the preservation of data confidentiality with the enhancement of port security. Furthermore, the paper discusses how object detection and anonymization methods are strategically employed to protect sensitive information while still allowing access to critical operational details such as cargo and vessel types. Emphasis is placed on video anonymization's pivotal role in strengthening port security by concealing high-value assets and minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive data. By integrating the Matrix Platform, ports gain the capability to proactively manage security risks, safeguard assets, and secure information. This adaptable platform can be deployed in both Edge and Cloud environments, ensuring alignment with the specific needs of smart ports, with a primary focus on data anonymization. In conclusion, as the port industry continues to evolve, this paper asserts that the adoption of video anonymization techniques is fundamental for future growth and development, providing assurance of privacy and security in this dynamic landscape.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), various industries have been propelled forward. In the field of medicine, AI has proven to be invaluable in aiding doctors to gain further insights into medical conditions, medical imaging is a prime example. Indeed, the availability of large-scale datasets like ImageNet has significantly contributed to the success of deep learning models in various computer vision tasks. However, when it comes to medical image classification, the availability of large, labeled datasets is relatively limited. As a result, the number of models specifically trained for medical image classification is comparatively smaller. This paper presents a novel neural network, named Channel Grouping and Partial Convolution Network (CGPNet), built upon the foundation of the InceptionNext model. Leveraging the commonly used lightweight technique, along with the introduction of grouped partial convolutions and dynamic convolutions, our proposed network exhibits promising performance. In particular, experiments were conducted on the ISIC-2019 (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which demonstrates that our model achieves 2.61% improvement in top-1 accuracy compared to InceptionNext.}

	abstract = {Dual offline payment has a great practical value for the transactions without network connection. Unfortunately, it is a puzzle in the view of central bank digital currency (CBDC) which should keep the centralized banking system and simultaneously avoid double-spending, counterfeiting, relay attack and other issues. There is limited literature about securely designing the dual offline payment solution specifically for CBDC. One public method that establishes the mobile payment on both trusted execution environment and secure element (SE), is too heavy to promote the general application. In response to this issue, we propose DOPS, a feasible dual offline payment scheme for two equipotent e-wallets of mobile device users. By only adopting SE, the secure architecture of the mobile device is constructed. Based on it, DOPS comes with the complete data structures and the core procedures for offline payment. We list the exceptional scenarios that might arise during dual offline transactions and provide explicit protocols for addressing them. A security analysis of the approach is presented based on realistic assumptions. Subsequently, we develop and evaluate a prototype system using feasible parameters. Our assessment demonstrates that DOPS fulfills the practical needs of offline CBDC payments for mobile users, excelling in both security and efficiency aspects.}

	abstract = {Privacy has long been considered a fundamental component of consumer services. Privacy decreases the possibility of consumers revealing confidential information in terms of customer service. However, it also refers to service pleasure, flexibility, and convenience. This study formally analyzes the trade-off between privacy and openness in financial services. Because if the consumer favors privacy above openness, they may have limited freedom in the service provider’s service, and vice versa. As a result, it is critical to choose the optimum solution to balance the trade-off. In this paper, we used the bilateral conflict concept to analyze the trade-off problem to achieve Nash equilibrium by controlling the quantity of information. We demonstrated that Nash equilibrium can be reached if two requirements are satisfied: (i) there is inequality in benefits for both the information owner and the decision maker, and (ii) there is inequality in benefits just for the information owner.}

In our research, we employ Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) as features for our classification process. Hardware Performance Counters are integrated into a processor’s Performance Monitoring Unit. The advantages of utilizing hardware performance counters include low overhead access and obviating the need for source code. By selecting hardware features relevant to the unpacking process, we train machine learning classifiers in a supervised learning manner. In our study, we investigate the use of hardware performance counters for the classification purpose of binary packers. Our findings indicate that when configured to alleviate nondeterminism, Hardware Performance Counters possess the capability and potential to classify prevalent packers that are readily accessible.}

	abstract = {Over the last number of years Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly popular in several fields such as agriculture and medicine. Recently UAVs have been used for the deployment within Emergency Response for visual scouting of an impacted area in addition to delivering supplies via payload. UAVs are also capable of acting as networking nodes using incorporated technology or by attaching independent hardware via the UAVs payload capability. The application of UAVs as a network node(s) can enable increased performance within the network as UAV based nodes can alter their current position due to their unique nature of mobility. Therefore, this study aims to assess the performance of aerial communication using UVAs which incorporate the use of a small Bluetooth 5.0 (BLE 5.0) node as a payload. In this research, the impact generated via Air-Ground Propagation on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement was investigated. In addition to this, this paper also investigates any performance difference displayed between different Transmission Power Profiles as this in turn affects the overall power consumption of the transmitting device. When operating at heights of 5, 10, and 15 Metres the maximum average loss was found to be 2.37 dBm among the Standard Transmission Power profile and a maximum average loss of 1.18 dBm occurring with the Enhanced Transmission Power Profile.}

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged as critical components in various industries, integrating digital and physical elements to improve efficiency and automation, from smart manufacturing and autonomous vehicles to advanced healthcare devices. However, the increasing complexity of CPS and their deployment in highly dynamic contexts undermine user trust. This motivates the investigation of methods capable of generating explanations about the behavior of CPS. To this end, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies show potential. However, these approaches do not consider contextual variables that a CPS may be subjected to (e.g., temperature, humidity), and the provided explanations are typically not actionable. In this article, we propose an Actionable Contextual Explanation System (ACES) that considers such contextual influences. Based on a user query about a behavioral attribute of a CPS (for example, vibrations and speed), ACES creates contextual explanations for the behavior of such a CPS considering its context. To generate contextual explanations, ACES uses a context model to discover sensors and actuators in the physical environment of a CPS and obtains time-series data from these devices. It then cross-correlates these time-series logs with the user-specified behavioral attribute of the CPS. Finally, ACES employs a counterfactual explanation method and takes user feedback to identify causal relationships between the contextual variables and the behavior of the CPS. We demonstrate our approach with a synthetic use case; the favorable results obtained, motivate the future deployment of ACES in real-world scenarios.}

	abstract = {IoT ecosystems are rapidly expanding, and device management is emerging as a key challenge due to the scale, complexity, and dynamism of IoT systems. The adoption of autonomous techniques shows promise to alleviate key issues including maintaining organisational security when large volumes of IoT devices are being added and removed from a telecommunications network. Here we propose a proactive IoT device management approach that addresses the need to control network access in a risk-based manner. The proposed system comprises of two novel core components, a Management Platform for IoT (MP-IoT) component and an Intent-Based Microsegmentation (IBMS) component. The MP-IoT component carries out a risk management role and combines with IBMS to provide risk-based network segmentation. The two components work together to proactively manage risks by migrating devices between isolated network segments according to a dynamic assessment of the risk to the system from an individual device. Self-healing techniques may then be used to mitigate risks associated with a device and consequently change the network segment that it resides in. Here we present the key challenges associated with typical IoT environments and demonstrate how they are addressed by the proposed Proactive IoT Device Management architecture. A prototype implementation is also presented to validate the operation of the proposed architecture.}

	abstract = {Robots and IoT devices must process real-time signals using embedded systems with limited power and clock speeds – rather than large CPUs or GPUs. FPGAs offer highly parallel computation, but are difficult to program, both algorithmically and at hardware implementation level. Programmers of digital signal processing (DSP), machine vision, and neural networks typically work in high level, serial languages such as Python, so would benefit from a tool to automatically convert this code to run on FPGA. We present a design for a compiler from a serial Python subset to parallel dataflow FPGA, in which the physical connectivity and dataflow of the digital logic mirrors the logical dataflow of the programs. The subset removes some imperative features from Python and focuses on Python’s functional programming elements, which can be more easily compiled into physical digital logic implementations of dataflows. Some imperative features are retained but interpreted under alternative functional semantics, making them easier to parallelize. These dataflows can then be pipelined for efficient continuous real-time data processing. An open-source partial implementation is provided together with a compilable simple neuron program.}

	abstract = {The reliability of any IoT system\'s operation depends upon the accuracy of sensor data. Numerous sensing devices are also embedded in autonomous systems. The adversary can manipulate the output of an IoT device, such as a speed sensor or a temperature sensor, by altering its hardware, software modules, network parameters, or device configuration. These unauthorized changes may affect the legitimate operation of the autonomous system and cause a malfunction or a safety hazard. In addition, the corrupt sensor data may also affect the machine learning models by introducing false training data or biasing the model towards certain decisions to cause the autonomous system to make incorrect decisions. The existing techniques mostly perform memory attestation or ensure the secure execution of an application. In addition, current approaches have unrealistic assumptions about adversaries’ capabilities and rely on trusted parties to initiate and run the attestation protocol. No existing technique provides all the required security features, including protection against return-oriented programming and network attacks, including interference, rainbow, and physical compromise. Hence, this research presents a secure and efficient version of a unique hybrid attestation scheme "I2Map" that detects a malicious or malfunctioning IoT device based on an integrity map. The performance analysis infers that I2Map performs better in transaction commit time and transaction costs with more device parameters than its predecessor.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the first near-field electro-magnetic (EM) sensor that is entirely implemented in the FPGA configurable fabric, without the use of any peripherals such as analog-to-digital converters, external antennas, or resistor-capacitor circuits. The sensor detects changes in path delays caused by external EM radiation using an antenna (composed of the interconnect) and a time-to-digital converter. A cloud-based FPGA remotely configured with such a sensor may act as a receiving end of a wireless covert channel, e.g., to another FPGA in the neighborhood that does not share any common resources with the receiving FPGA. Thus, our results show the plausibility of an exploitable attack vector for cloud-based FPGA that is not limited to the multi-tenancy scenario.}

	abstract = {Kernel-level rootkits are considered stealthy malware versions that can target Internet of Things (IoT) devices as part of large-scale Advanced Persistent Threats. These can gain root privileges and easily hide their attack traces within the system. Several rootkit detection approaches have been proposed, but they lack the consideration of power resource limitation on battery-based edge devices. To address these limitations, this paper models the interaction between stealthy malware and the device’s anomaly detection algorithm as a Colonel Blotto game in order to produce the set of mixed strategies that optimize the allocation of security resources dedicated to monitoring kernel-level processes and detecting abnormal system calls while preserving device power. We present the models for both versions of the game, static and dynamic, to reflect a realistic deployment scenario. The preliminary numerical results show that the strategic resource allocation enabled by the proposed game model achieves better security compared to non-strategic scenarios that do not consider the attacker’s resource budget.}

	abstract = {With the continuous development of heavy-haul railway technology, the demand for the faster transmission and higher bandwidth capacity of wireless communication network is also increasing. Therefore, Long Term Evolution for Railway (LTE-R) begin to replace Global System for Mobile Communications for Railway (GSM-R) to burden the core wireless communication services. In order to improve the operation and maintenance efficiency of LTE-R network, this paper proposes a multi-step LTE-R communication quality prediction method based on Differential Evolution algorithm and Temporal Convolutional Network with Coordinate Attention (TCNCA). Firstly, this method uses differential evolution and permutation importance index to filter the features of multivariate LTE-R communication quality data. Then, the coordinate attention mechanism and TCN network were fused to build the prediction model. Finally, this method still used Differential Evolution to adjust the model parameters based on Mann—Kendall test, so that the model could take into account the prediction accuracy and the trend of data change, thus realize the multi-step prediction for LTE-R communication quality. Experimental results on real data set show that the proposed method can provide decision support for the active maintenance of LTE-R network, and has high application value.}

	abstract = {Accurate Internet traffic predictions can provide support to network operators for applications such as traffic engineering, bandwidth allocation, anomaly detection, etc. We apply and compare different forecasting techniques (traditional and machine learning-based techniques) on real BGP data that is collected from two well-known Internet exchange points (IXPs) to derive BGP future volume-based predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that multivariate Bayesian Ridge outperforms all other forecasting techniques we consider. Through univariate LSTM, we are able to predict new BGP volume-based features. Furthermore, to study the impact of dataset size on BGP forecasting, we perform experiments on three BGP dataset sizes, i.e., Short (one-month), Medium (three-months), and Long (five-months) Periods. Our results show that the Short-Period BGP dataset seems to be sufficient for getting accurate predictions. We also present a use case study (forecast Google Leak anomaly) that supports our experimental evaluations. We provide our collected BGP datasets publically which will be helpful to perform further research experiments and analysis regarding BGP traffic predictions.}

	abstract = {Insider attacks in organizations are currently one of the most crucial cybersecurity challenges. Traitors are one of the most dangerous types of insider attackers. They are difficult to detect because they know the organization, processes, defense mechanisms, and employees. Besides abusing their rights and accesses, they can use their co-workers’ rights and accesses. They can hide their activities to perform attacks inconspicuously. The current masquerader detection techniques usually rely on the fact that the masquerader is an outsider, making them unable to detect attacks from the traitor. To detect these insider attackers, which we call masquerading traitors, we propose the human-as-solution approach and engage the employees in deciding whether the usage of their rights and accesses is suspicious and, therefore, might be performed by a masquerading traitor.}

Previous work has demonstrated that text generation systems are capable of engaging with attackers as automatic scam-baiters, but the fluency and coherence of generated text may be a limit to the effectiveness of such systems.In this paper, we report on the results of a month-long experiment comparing the effectiveness of two ChatGPT-based automatic scam-baiters to a control measure. Within our results, with engagement from over 250 real email fraudsters, we find that ChatGPT-based scam-baiters show a marked increase in scammer response rate and conversation length relative to the control measure, outperforming previous approaches. We discuss the implications of these results and practical considerations for wider deployment of automatic scam-baiting.}

	abstract = {The AI-based network traffic classification technology has played a vital role in Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM). Network Traffic Features are the critical input for AI-based network traffic classification. However, unlike images and natural language traffic, features have high dispersion and weak stability. On the one hand, part of the key numerical flow features have a wide range of values. By scaling the features, the model can be better trained, which allows the classifier to make more accurate predictions. On the other hand, edge networks cannot scale features as well as the training set in the cloud. This situation affects the model’s performance on edge devices. This paper proposes a novel processing method of flow features for the AI-based network traffic classification model using cloud-edge collaboration. The method leverages the strong computational power of cloud computing to scale the flow features and transmit parameters derived from feature scaling to edge networks. The edge network processes the real-time flow through parameters, significantly enhancing the devices’ accuracy. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted four experiments, comparing models trained with and without feature scaling. The experimental results demonstrate that the model trained with feature scaling outperforms the model trained without scaling.}

	abstract = {Techniques of Machine Learning (ML) have recently been widely used in several applications, but not much for embedded systems, particularly those of safety-critical functionality, and are expected to help solve complex PHM and RUL which are difficult to be overcome with traditional approaches. This paper proposes a novel approach to encompass data-driven system-level health management, which comprises three main processes: an exhaustive offline training using machine learning techniques to derive a model capable of predicting the system of interest within fixed performance criteria; followed by its deployment on the targeted embedded system for real-time health assessment and finally the ability to provide a multi-step ahead forecasting for the system prognostics.The ability to monitor the current state of the systems and predict their behaviour becomes essential. Therefore, techniques to establish fault tolerance and fault prediction are required. Condition monitoring (CM), prognostics and health management (PHM) and remaining useful life (RUL) are enablers for fault detection, fault progression and system degradation.This paper presents a ML-based methodology for the PHM of embedded systems, aiming at generalization and real-time performance.}

	abstract = {Efficiently utilizing beam resources in multi-beam satellite systems is crucial for improving system performance. Existing beam-hopping allocation algorithms focus solely on Quality of Service (QoS) objectives, such as time delay, transmission rate, and system capacity, while overlooking the interference caused by large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations on Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite systems. Although beam shutdown and power reduction are common methods to mitigate interference, they can adversely impact the quality of service and communication coverage in areas. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based interference avoidance beam-hopping allocation algorithm(DRL-IABHA). The article proposes an IABHA optimization approach to maximize system throughput in a multi-beam satellite system under interference avoidance conditions. To handle the time-dependent nature of this problem, it is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is commonly used in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) analysis. The MDP state is transformed into an image and features are extracted using convolutional neural networks. Simulation results indicate that the DRL-IABHA algorithm can enhance system capacity by 22.94% and prevent interference with GEO ground stations more effectively than other beam assignment techniques}

	abstract = {The Dijkstra algorithm has been widely used in the routing protocol design. However, the shortest path tree calculation method based on the Dijkstra algorithm fails to take advantage of the characteristics of the graph structure in topologies of satellite networks and incurs a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity and efficient algorithm for satellite routing according to the special topology and link latency distribution of LEO satellite constellations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the same optimal performance as the Dijkstra algorithm but with much-reduced complexity. In particular, under the network scale of 60×30, the average calculation time of our algorithm is less than\n1\n10\nof that of the Dijkstra algorithm.}

	abstract = {With the development of large-scale low earth orbit satellite constellation networks (LS-LEOSCN), it is key to make constellation judgment based on observation data. The problem lies in that the realistic constellation configuration (CC) may be different from declared. To solve this problem, a multiple chord distance regression (MCDR) algorithm is proposed to identify the realistic CC based on the Two-Line Elements (TLE) data. Experiments are done for both the constructed data and real TLE data, including the Satrlink, IridiumNext and OneWeb data. It turns out that these constellations can be well judged and given their maintenance parameters.}

	abstract = {In this paper, global interference scenarios are constructed for both uplink and downlink, focusing on co-channel interference between low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation systems, and interference calculations are performed for co-located ground stations. The mathematical correlation between simulation time parameters and the spatial and beam characteristics of the constellation system is investigated from two perspectives: time step and duration design. The mathematical model for determining the time parameters is established based on the relative positions of satellites and ground stations, orbital characteristics, and antenna beam configurations. We analyze the characteristic curves of time step and duration variations, as well as compare different antenna beam widths for uplink and downlink. The magnitude of simulation duration increments with different beam widths is investigated to enhance the efficiency of interference evaluation and analysis, and the curve of interference-to-noise ratio is analyzed. Compared with the actual data registered by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), our method is able to capture the instantaneous worst-case interference in the system under typical conditions. In addition, it gives recommendations regarding the range of interference deviation percentages that can be obtained by choosing different simulation time parameters, thus demonstrating the accuracy and validity.}

	abstract = {The large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems are considered the most promising communication technologies in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. LEO satellite systems have low latency, high throughput and wide coverage, which means they can provide telecommunication services for rescue and disaster scenarios. Since the LEO satellite communication systems and IMT systems are envisaged to share the same spectrum, the potential harmful interference issues must be analyzed. In this paper, the Walker constellation model is adopted in the satellite constellation design. Considering the large-scale deployment of LEO satellite systems and IMT systems, millions of base stations are scattered all over the place. Furthermore, we aim at evaluating the mutual interference of two systems in the Ka band and utilize terrain data to deploy IMT systems in the Contiguous United States. Specifically, an innovative method called electronic fences is proposed in the paper, which is conducive to alleviating the interference in satellite-terrestrial communication systems.}

	abstract = {With the commercialization of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) technology, this paper studies the problem of ensuring coexistence between new frequency bands and existing satellite systems, which has led to an increasing demand for spectrum resources. Specifically, the research evaluates the potential interference between IMT and Earth-Exploration Satellite Service (passive)-EESS (passive) in the 10-10.5 GHz frequency band. This paper presents an innovative methodology for constructing a dynamic EESS (passive) system model based on orbital elements. In addition, the IMT system model was built by analyzing satellite imagery data. The results show different levels of interference sensitivity among passive sensors, highlighting the need to impose necessary restrictions on IMT systems to protect EESS (passive) systems. Overall, this paper introduces an innovative method for modeling the dynamic interaction between satellites and large-scale base stations, which is beneficial for analyzing the coexistence of IMT and EESS (passive) systems.}

	abstract = {Satellite and ground systems have traditionally operated independently, each providing unique services. However, the integration of satellite-ground networks necessitates collaboration to ensure consistent Quality of Service (QoS) for users in the Satellite-Ground Integrated Network (SGIN). This paper focuses on achieving highly reliable shared QoS orchestration for SGINs. We analyze eight typical SGIN services, including ultra-long-distance real-time, densely connected, high-speed mobile broadband, real-time large-capacity transmission, non-real-time large-capacity transmission, highly secure, deterministic guarantee transmission, and high-reliability guaranteed transmission services. The constantly changing SGIN topology, due to rapid inter-satellite link switching, prompts us to explore data-driven multi-service identification using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. For accurate identification, two approaches are proposed in this paper: a Decision Tree (DT)-based scheme and an ensemble learning-based scheme. Additionally, we present the construction of a shared QoS system in SGINs, along with the evaluation and assurance of AI services using the concept of QoS of the SGIN AI service (QoSGINAI). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AI-based multi-service identification schemes.}

	abstract = {With the growing demand for mobile communication services and continuous advances in communication technologies, ubiquitous coverage and Internet of Everything have become basic capabilities required for 5G, 6G and future networks. On-orbit autonomy enables satellites to perform tasks, process data, adjust parameters, update software, diagnose faults and recover functions autonomously in orbit. This enhances intelligence, efficiency and reduces operation costs and risks, especially for large low earth orbit (LEO) constellations. On-orbit autonomy is an important trend with great significance and value. Although some research and tests have been conducted as well as application requests and standardization gathered, modeling constellation autonomy from an on-orbit communication and computing perspective has received little attention. This paper reviews related standards, research, and tests as a foundation for modeling. Key technologies, networking and management are studied as major concerns in modeling. The Constellation Autonomy Modeling (CAM) framework for agile on-orbit communication and computing is proposed as a reference model and method for on-orbit autonomy.}

One vital aspect of LCLU research involves identifying modifications in impervious surface cover, which has significantly increased due to global economic growth and the rising urban population in many parts of the world. This investigation employs Landsat 9 OLI- 2/TIRS-2 imagery with a 30m spatial resolution to map structures in the Ziarat District of Pakistan, encompassing forests, water bodies, and barren land. It aims to detect changes in tree cover and canopy height. A time series of Landsat 9 OLI-2/TIRS-2 images were utilized to create change detection and land cover maps. The Analysis of Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) for the Ziarat District was conducted using the GEE platform. The satellite images were classified into broad land cover classes, which include impervious surfaces, forest/tree cover, grassland/cropland, and water. The generated change detection map facilitates the identification of locations that have undergone modifications due to new constructions, offering valuable insights for the implementation of urban development policies and disaster management on a global scale.}

	abstract = {Customer churn prediction is critical to an enterprise. Therefore, the improvement of the churn prediction model can directly help enterprises to better manage customers to obtain more profit. Meanwhile, the explanation of the decision-making mechanism of the churn prediction model can guide enterprises to accurately understand and evaluate the likelihood of customer churn, and then make more targeted measures to prevent customer churn. However, most existing deep learning approaches have poor model interpretability due to the black-box characteristics of neural networks. In addition, there are few previous studies on the model interpretability of customer churn predictions. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Interpretable DeepFM (iDeepFM) to study the model interpretability. The Proposed iDeepFM model introduces multi-head self-attention mechanism to the embedding layer, the linear interaction component, and the deep component. Especially, the deep component computes the high-order feature interactions by stacking multiple attention blocks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world telecom customer churn datasets. We calculate attention scores which are used to interpret the prediction results for each component. The results show that the proposed approach not only improves the performance of DeepFM but also offers good model interpretability.}

	abstract = {Traditional indoor distribution systems in 2G, 3G, and 4G networks are mostly single-path, but the indoor distribution systems in 5G networks require dual paths to get greater capacity by space division multiplex. This document describes the reconstruction from a traditional single-path indoor distribution system to a dual-path indoor distribution system on a 5G network. Suitable scenarios need to be found in which the engineering workload is small and the cost is low, and in the scenario, a key point is that one path in the dual-path indoor distribution system would be leaked signals from nearby floors. If the level of the leaked signal is too low and the signal quality is poor, only low-order modulation modes can be used. Even if dual-stream access is provided, the download rate cannot be improved. The download rate is even lower than that of a single-path indoor distributed system. The suitable sicario in which leaked signal can support RANK 2 is discussed in the paper that 5G users can get higher throughput in the dual path upgrade indoor distribution system.}

	abstract = {With the increasing demand for high performance and low power consumption in embedded real-time systems, performance asymmetric multiprocessor architecture is beginning to be applied to embedded real-time systems, because this heterogeneous architecture allows the system to allocate computational resources as needed to satisfy the demands of each application and dynamic workloads. Most of the previous studies on EDZL scheduling algorithms have focused on task prioritization, and they simply assign the highest priority tasks to the fastest processors. In this paper, we choose to assign the highest priority tasks on the slowest processor and propose SSFEDZL (slowest speed fit for earliest deadline first until zero-laxity) scheduling algorithm. We compare SSF-EDZL scheduling algorithm with other scheduling algorithms and the experimental results show that SSF-EDZL is a better scheduling algorithm which has higher processor utilization and better scheduling performance.}

	abstract = {As a key role in the future network functionalities, artificial intelligence (AI) has been studied widely. To match the envisioned traffic evolution trend and communication requirement, Network Data Analytic Function(NWDAF) is a new proposed 5G component to provide analytics for any Network Functions (NFs). Considering sending all data to a central NWDAF instance is extremely time-consuming and it raises concerns about security vulnerabilities and data overload, it's expected to design a distributed NWDAF architecture which is able to enhance NF data localization, improve security, reduce control overhead during model training, shorten the training time, and finally, enhance the accuracy of the trained models by virtue of local testing on a real-time network. Federated learning is considered in future NWDAF design, while its detailed structure and processes are not standardized yet. This paper studies the effectiveness of distributed federated learning based traffic characteristics analysis for NWDAF. Simulation shows that the learning accuracy is nolinear with data loss probability. Under the simulation assumption, the solution could endure 30% data loss, while the learning accuracy and the retransmission dramatically rise when data loss probability is greater than 45%.}

	abstract = {It is difficult to find the root cause alarms by the traditional operation and maintenance methods quickly and accurately, due to the complex architecture of the 5G core network. At present, the library of cross-layer alarm association rules for the 5G core network is not complete. Therefore, the cross-layer alarm association rules mining algorithm of 5G core network is proposed in this paper, which is based on OPTICS algorithm and the weighted FP-growth algorithm. Initially, a time-correlated alarm transaction set is generated by OPTICS algorithm, and then a spatially correlated alarm transaction set is further extracted according to the three-layer topology. Finally, the weighted FP-growth algorithm is used to generate cross-layer alarm association rules. According to the experimental results, it suggests that the alarm transaction set is effectively compressed, and the accuracy of alarm rules mining is improved greatly by this algorithm.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of fiber optic cable failures has been identified as a key contributor to failures across multiple network systems in the realm of network operations and maintenance. Meanwhile, with the continued expansion of fiber optic cable adoption and its widening coverage, the task of maintenance has grown increasingly complex for network operators. In the context of today’s highly efficient, expansive, and intricate networks, the limitations of conventional methods for operating and maintaining fiber optic cables have become unmistakably evident. To meet the pressing need for cost reduction, this paper introduces an innovative optical cable fault location method, leveraging automation and artificial intelligence technology. Tailored for practical network applications, this method conducts a comprehensive analysis of concurrent faults across multiple systems, pinpointing their origin in optical cable faults. Through the implementation of diverse navigation strategies, it achieves automatic optical cable fault location. The adoption of this method delivers a substantial reduction in fault location time, diminishing it from minutes to mere milliseconds. This dramatic increase in location speed leads to significant labor cost reductions, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of network maintenance.}

	abstract = {Along with constructing new power systems and the Energy Internet, much power data is generated and stored at the edge devices, which may contain customer privacy and be challenging to use. Besides, the lack of computing power and the untrustworthy environment in the edge layer prevent further development of the data. How to effectively and securely utilize the accumulated power data and facilitate the construction of new power systems and power business transformation is now a significant challenge for the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC). This paper proposes a new data sharing architecture based on federated learning and blockchain technology, which exchanges the data model instead of the original data to ensure data security with a privacy protection protocol and a lightweight consensus for edge devices. Meanwhile, an incentive mechanism is established to encourage high-quality data share and training. In conclusion, the architecture has approximate accuracy with acceptable privacy cost compared to traditional methods with high privacy preservation. It can be widely used in big data scenarios in smart distribution or metering areas with medium-sized network scenarios.}

Distributed databases are becoming more and more common in data-intensive industries such as banking and telecommunications. The selection of distributed database products requires comprehensively consider the function, performance, security, ease of use and stability of the product. The stability of distributed database is known to be difficult in testing and product selection. The method widely used in database testing is TPC-DS (transaction processing performance council-decision support) benchmark, which is only suitable for functional and performance testing. To deal with this drawback, a distributed database stability testing platform based on chaos engineering methodology is developed. Through the perturbation injection by using the stability testing platform, the performance fluctuation of the database under pressure condition can be observed, and the stability of the database can then be evaluated.}

	abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent hot topic that involves multimedia analysis, computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and even a broad perspective of artificial intelligence, which is challenging and has obtained increasing attention. VQA needs a complete understanding of the spatial relationship, textual clues, as well as the common sense for an actual image. However, most existing approaches simply embed and concatenate the features of questions and images to predict answers. Treating all embeddings equally without consideration of relation consistency hinders the model performance. In this paper, we propose an explicit Multi-Granularity Cross-Attention network (MGCAN) that mutually learns the multi-modal branches. MGCAN jointly matches word-level representation with whole image, and patch-level representation with the whole question that infers the high-order vision-semantic relationship. Experiments conducted on VQA datasets demonstrate that the proposed MGCAN outperforms previous baselines. The cross-attention mechanism explicitly exploits the relevant visual and textual clues that lead to superior prediction.}

	abstract = {Due to the implementation of national security-related laws and regulations, data privacy protection and ownership issues have attracted much attention, meanwhile, the rise of technologies such as 5G, IOT, big data, and edge computing has promoted the digital transformation of data as a factor of production to empower social governance. At present, traditional machine learning still uses the method of data-centered large models for training and reasoning. This method brings about data fragmentation and island distribution and other problems, which have become the key problems restricting the popularization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology applications. In this paper, we explore a federated learning model for user complaint warning algorithm based on big data and other enterprise side data. The experimental result also shows that the prediction accuracy of the federated learning model and the traditional logistic regression model are within an acceptable range on the premise of ensuring user privacy and data security.}

	abstract = {Software products have brought convenience to modern society but also pose significant security risks due to various types of vulnerabilities. Identifying vulnerability names is vital for program repair and software maintenance, but the lack of training data presents a challenge. Big data analytics and machine learning can help overcome this challenge by processing large amounts of data and improving the accuracy of vulnerability name prediction. Considering that the data is often from datasets composed of multiple sources, a feature-based or attention-based multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) approach is required. In this paper, we propose an MSDA method based on both feature and attention to accomplish the task of predicting vulnerability names, called Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Vulnerability Name Prediction (MSDA-VNP). First, MSDA-VNP reduces domain divergence by adversarial training and then uses domain-invariant features to obtain feature correlations between individual source and target domains. In combination with the obtained domain correlations, Weighted multi-kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (WMK-MMD) is proposed as the attention mechanism. Second, a data augmentation strategy is employed to enhance MSDA-VNP to identify privacy-related vulnerabilities. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on eight Java real-world projects in the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD). The experimental results show that the proposed method MSDA-VNP performed efficiently and stably for the 44 types of vulnerabilities involved. The data augmentation strategy has also been proved to be effective as an enhancement for the proposed method MSDA-VNP.}

	abstract = {Health systems worldwide have an unprecedented opportunity to enhance healthcare service delivery due to the rapid development of emerging digital technologies. Many advancements have been made in the medical field, with deep learning proving particularly useful when applied to a large enough number of well-defined samples. Although, this aspect may make deep learning harder to implement in settings with limited-size datasets. In this study, we present a new method of chronic kidney disease detection (CKDD) by combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Afterward, synthetic sample data was created using GAN, which enlarged the dataset. Subsequently, processing these synthetic samples, the CNN classifier was applied. According to experimental assessments, the suggested CKDD-GAN methodology accuracy is superior to without the GAN technique. Moreover, the proposed CKDD-GAN-based model outperformed with an accuracy of 98.10%. Even though standard synthetic data samples seemed to improve classification performance, GAN-based enhancements resulted in a 2.91% improvement. GAN implementations for detecting chronic kidney disease are highly beneficial since they also increase awareness about its possible uses in various other diseases.}

	abstract = {Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) is a newgeneration vehicle equipped with advanced on-board sensors, controllers, actuators, and other devices. In recent years, CAVs have gradually become the main trend of vehicle development, and people’s choice of travel mode has begun to change from traditional cars to CAVs. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) connects vehicles to everything and allows transportation participants to interconnect through modern communication technologies. In C-V2X method, cooperative lane change is one of the important parts. The challenge of cooperative lane change has two main parts, one is how to determine a safe and efficient passing strategy, and the other is how to determine a reasonable communication method. To solve the challenge, in this paper, we use V2X communication as the basis of vehicle information exchange, transform the two-vehicle lane-changing problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then solve it through Q-learning and DQN to obtain the ideal lane-changing decision.}

	abstract = {The security of data throughout its entire life cycle has become the most urgent and fundamental security issue in the digital economy era. With the continuous expansion and deepening of vehicle-infrastructure-cloud integration (VICI), data among the vehicle, infrastructure, and cloud are interconnected, leading to a constant extension in the scope of automotive data. Focusing solely on vehicle-end data is no longer sufficient to meet the developmental needs of intelligent connected vehicles. Considering data security from the perspective of VICI holds significant importance for ensuring the safety of the entire life cycle of intelligent connected vehicle data. In this context, this paper focuses on data security for VICI, analyzes the scope and characteristics of the data, explores the key challenges, and elaborates on the application of data security technology for VICI. Building upon this, the paper proposes DSA-VICI and conducts an analysis of the development trends in data security for VICI.}

	abstract = {Smart home applications are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide safety, comfort, and remote assistance. These applications are usually controlled using a smart home controller, which is often the target of malware attacks. A successful attack may result in financial loss, disclosure of personal and/or sensitive information, or even loss of human lives. Although existing research has employed machine learning models to detect various malware attacks in smart home systems, they haven’t directly tackled the issue of class imbalance in this domain. In addition, the use of ensemble learners is expected to provide improved performance. To address this, we investigated different oversampling techniques to increase the number of samples in the minority classes and incorporated ensemble learners to see their impact on the prediction performance. Experimental evaluation indicates a marked enhancement of 4-5% across metrics, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, and the F-1 score.}

	abstract = {In the 6G vision, networks are expected to be more flexible in quickly solving network traffic scheduling issues and deploying services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an innovative technology that involves extracting network functions from dedicated equipment to create Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). These VNFs are then chained together to form a Service Function Chain (SFC) that provides network service. However, there are still some issues with existing network service orchestration tools, such as unreasonable multi-traffic scheduling and additional programming requirements for end-users. We have developed a solution to address the challenges posed by data coupling and bandwidth preemption in multi-service environments. Our dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) Guarantee model utilizes hierarchical analysis to prioritize traffic among multiple service data streams and employs a service scheduling algorithm based on a weighted fair queue to allocate link resources. For user convenience, we have also created an intuitive web orchestration platform called EasyOrchestrator, enabling users to encapsulate common VNFs and build services quickly. Our experimental evaluation has shown that EasyOrchestrator significantly reduces service construction time compared to the benchmark. At the same time, our QoS assurance mechanism effectively minimizes network congestion and ensures the successful operation of high-priority services.}

	abstract = {With the increasing market competition, telecom operators need to improve the level of services, ensure the quality of experience, as well as reduce the cost of enterprise. Therefore it is crucial to evaluate the value of telecom customers accurately. The traditional method of telecom customer value assessment is mainly based on ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), which is one-dimensional and cannot evaluate customer value comprehensively. This paper proposes a multidimensional customer value assessment method, including two perspectives, Current value and Potential value to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluation. Also, an intelligent method based on swarm intelligence algorithm is presented to calculate the indicator weight for each characteristic field of customer value. The practical results show that the algorithm, which is applied to realistic scenarios of network operation, enables telecom operator to achieve a comprehensive and accurate customer value assessment in many issues such as customer churn warning and accurate recommendation, ultimately increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making closed loop for telecom operators. At last but not the least, the algorithm and system can benefit other industries to improve their intelligence level of customer service.}

	abstract = {To address the three main challenges in Digital Twin Network (DTN), we propose the Elastic Digital Twin Network Modeling (EDiTNetMdl) fitting in network life cycle to restrain resource occupation. The challenges our solution aims to tackle are: fulfilling differentiated requirements across Network Life Cycle (NLC) stages with a single DTN; loosening the decision delay caused by current DTNs, hampering utilization; and the prohibitive costs of fully replicating physical telecom infrastructure and systems. To tackle these challenges, EDiTNetMdl constructs DTN modeling in a hierarchical, multilayered abstraction. In this framework, Telecom Network Elements (NE) are represented as Classes and inheritance hierarchies. NE functions and connections are transformed into class methods along these inheritance chains. NLC stages are detected through probes which are specialized methods used to deduce the stage and needs. Complete data collection occurs at the bottom NE instances, while higher stages obtain well-abstracted metadata and functional descriptions. We enumerate 7 NLC use cases as inputs for numerical evaluations. Both the number of DTN Instances built and methods invoked are significantly decreased in EDiTNetMdl compared to contrasting solutions. Consequently, the resource occupation is significantly diminished, further highlighting the efficiency gains achieved with EDiTNetMdl.}

	abstract = {In quantitative trading, stock prediction plays a crucial role in portfolio optimization as it directly impacts the actual level of return. However, the trading market is complex, making return prediction a challenging task. To address this issue, existing works have utilized various technical indicators as inputs to enhance predictive accuracy. However, these indicators are often proprietary and kept confidential by quantitative funds and researchers, limiting their accessibility. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based method that leverages multiple parties’ technical indicators for stock return prediction without disclosing them. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method achieves higher portfolio return through portfolio optimization using the Mean-variance Optimization model compared to traditional approaches. The proposed method offers a promising solution for stock return prediction while maintaining the confidentiality of technical indicators.}

	abstract = {User address localization technologies have far-reaching implications for operators and governments. These technologies serve to optimize the planning and operation of communication networks and enhance the quality of network services, thereby providing powerful support for the provision of social public services, urban planning, and emergency management. The existing user address localization methods used by operators mainly rely on base stations locations and user-reported GPS. However, when the coverage area of a base station is too large, the localization accuracy will be poor even if triangulation techniques are used. Moreover, since the user-reported GPS is triggered by specific network events, its time continuity and volume are unstable. To address these limitations, this paper provides a user address localization method based on data fusion of signaling data from core network, measurement report (MR) data from radio access network, and operational data from carriers’ business support system (BSS). The feature engineering is performed from three dimensions, including base station level analysis, GPS level analysis, and address level analysis, to construct a building-level user address localization model. During data fusion, the signaling data compensates the weak time continuity of MR data, and the MR data compensates the poor localization accuracy of signaling data. In addition, through fusion with BSS data, it is able to convert users’ GPS positions into building-level address locations, thereby further improving the practicality and accuracy of the model..}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a popular distributed learning framework, enabling participants to collaboratively train models without the need to share raw data. In contrast to traditional machine learning frameworks that require the collection of large volumes of user data for centralized training, FL provides a novel approach that ensures data privacy and addresses the issue of data silos. However, the conventional FL framework faces challenges posed by the Byzantine Generals' Problem, where malicious clients can easily compromise the global learning process. Existing Byzantine solutions in FL are ineffective in defending against such attacks. This paper proposes a novel FL method called FLEvaluate, which assesses client trust based on performance metrics of their models and assigns aggregation weights according to their trust levels. By incorporating trust evaluation and normalization of consequences, this method amplifies or reduces the impact of clients in the global model aggregation process, thereby achieving a robust FL framework. Comparing FLEvaluate with the traditional FL framework FedAvg reveals that not only does FLEvaluate achieve comparable accuracy and precision but it also demonstrates effective defense against Byzantine attacks.}

On the uplink, the UE transmit power and the antenna port configuration of the terminal is less than those of the base station. In the process of services, users may encounter service difficulties due to the limited uplink coverage performance. This document describes a coverage and capacity enhancement solution. The coverage enhancement solution is based on MR and MDT data from the n28 band, which indicates the limitation scenarios of the n41 band. The MR and MDT sampling points have been collected in the maintenance platform as well as intra-system and different frequency points and RSRP of the 5G cell in the n28 band. The capacity enhancement solution is based on the overlay scenario of the NR TDD network with strong master control, the uplink time slot is added to the class A cell and the uplink capacity can be improved without interfering with class B cell.}

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques have gained significant traction in supply chain forecasting, driven by the increasing availability of data assets. These techniques offer opportunities to optimize management processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance decision-making for enterprise success. However, conventional statistical approaches dominating time series forecasting, such as the Autoregressive-moving-average model (ARMA), dynamic regression, and unobserved component models (UCMs), suffer from limitations in model accuracy and performance. They struggle to handle batch processing, large-scale big data, uncertainty-induced disruptions, and the synchronization of demand and supply scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a class of ensemble techniques that combine neural networks with baseline models. Firstly, we conduct classification and segmentation by leveraging feature engineering on signal components, such as spikes and anomalies as outlier skews, to capture the complexity of combined scenarios in categorical data hierarchies and identify patterns for ensemble forecasting. Subsequently, we employ an ensemble model equipped with time series pattern sensors to automatically discern signal components, encompassing seasonality, promotions, trends, and intermittent or discontinued activities. We evaluate the performance of eight commonly-used model categories, and our proposed ensemble modeling approaches exhibit substantial improvements in accuracy compared to individual baseline models and other univariate time series algorithms.}

	abstract = {Public transit transportation plays a crucial role in the daily lives of many individuals, offering an affordable and convenient means of commuting to work, school, and various destinations. For instance, it serves as a vital mode of transportation to access their workplace, educational institutions or other activities. Any disruptions in bus schedules can lead to significant consequences, including missing meetings and other essential commitments for city residents. Thus, this paper presents a big data science and engineering solution for transit performance analytics in the area of transportation analysis. The insights derived from this data analysis are instrumental in enhancing the performance of public transportation, ultimately leading to an improved commuter experience in the city and contributing to the development of a smart city. To elaborate, our solution employs frequent pattern mining to identify variations in transit performance across different neighborhoods. By uncovering significant patterns, we establish connections that help us pinpoint the factors contributing to bus delays in specific areas. Improving the accuracy of bus arrival and departure times can significantly enhance the overall usability and appeal of public transit for commuters, as people are more likely to rely on buses when they are punctual and ensure timely arrivals at their destinations. Furthermore, our solution equips users with tools to visualize the insights gained from the analysis of bus departure times in various neighborhoods at different times of the day. The practicality of our big data science and engineering solution was demonstrated through an evaluation using real-life public transit data from a Canadian city, underscoring its potential to contribute to the development of a smart city.}

	abstract = {The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is rapidly emerging as a viable alternative in the realm of Next Generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) due to the inherent challenge posed by traditional computer networks. SDN is revolutionizing traditional network architecture by significantly reducing the reliance on hardware. One of the key challenges of implementing SDN in NG-IoT is the extensive communication that occurs between the switches and the controllers due to the bursty nature of the traffic. Therefore, it is crucial to explore solutions aimed at minimizing this control overhead caused by excessive communication. To alleviate the burden on SDN controllers caused by switches, we propose a new method, named LSDA, which can effectively reduce the flow of control information. To promote fairness within the network, packets heading towards the same controller are aggregated, thereby eliminating the need for complex disassembly in the case of different destination controllers. The simulation results demonstrate that LSDA can effectively reduce the packet loss ratio while simultaneously improving network delay and jitter.}

Quantum circuits are required to be reversible owing to their inherent physical characteristics. However, synthesizing such circuits and optimizing their performance present substantial challenges. In this paper, we proposed to adopt reinforcement learning for synthesizing the reversible circuits involving NOT, CNOT, Toffoli, and other relevant gates and, in doing so, minimize the quantum computational costs of the resulting circuits. The experimental results demonstrated that the reversible circuits generated using the proposed method outperform the prior methods in both the gate counts and the total cost.}

	abstract = {Charging station location and capacity optimization is a critical issue in the field of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure planning as it involves multiple objectives and constraints. In this case, finding optimal solution for charging station placement problem requires an efficient optimization tool that could find quality solutions in short time. With this in mind, this work proposes a novel binary variant of atom search optimization (ASO) algorithm, utilizing the concept of quantum binarization technique, namely quantum-inspired binary ASO (QBASO) algorithm. The proposed QBASO possesses the same structure as original ASO algorithm, but the binarization procedure is performed using quantum gates and quantum bits. The performance of the proposed QBASO is tested using well-known benchmark functions and is then applied on EV charging station placement problem. The experimental results and statistical analyses show that QBASO algorithm is a promising optimization technique for solving charging station placement problem.}

Recent research focuses on utilizing complex feature engineering or large-scale pre-trained models to indirectly reduce the degradation of entity recognition caused by these two difficulties. In an attempt to directly address the difficulties, we propose KrNER, a new healthcare-oriented approach to named entity recognition. It utilizes knowledge enhancement and remote supervision techniques to effectively deal with the problem of recognizing complex entities, while guaranteeing better recognition results even in corpus-scarce contexts. Experiments show that KrNER is very effective and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Chinese medical named entity recognition models.}

	abstract = {Text classification is a key task of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field that aims at assigning predefined categories to textual documents. Performing text classification requires features that effectively represent the content and the meaning of textual documents. Selecting a suitable method for term weighting is of central importance and can improve the quality of the classification method. In this paper, we propose to a new text classification solution to perform Category-based Feature Augmentation (CFA) on the document representation. First, a term-category feature matrix is derived from a modified version of the supervised Term-Frequency Inverse-Category-Frequency (TF-ICF) weighting model. This is done by embedding the TF-ICF matrix in a one-layer feed-forward neural network. The latter is trained using the gradient descent algorithm allowing to iteratively update the term-category matrix until reaching convergence. The model produces category-based feature vector representations that are used to augment the document representations and perform the classification task. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our lean model approach improves text classification accuracy and is significantly more efficient compared with its deep model alternatives.}

	abstract = {Release planning is a critical step in the development of a software product, and it involves many factors. Deciding what to build for the next software release requires taking into account not only the cost of building a subset of software features, but also the expected satisfaction of the clients, as well as the dependencies that the features might have among them. This problem, called Next Release Problem, can be difficult to tackle by expert judge, or even intractable if the number of requirements, dependencies and clients to consider is very large. In the literature, this problem has been approached from the so-called search-based software engineering field, introducing a variety of metaheuristic algorithms to obtain a subset of release proposals that simultaneously optimise both cost and satisfaction. In this work, we present a GRASP-based advanced method, and evaluate it against other families of algorithms commonly applied to this problem, using two public and four synthetic datasets for the evaluation. Results show that solutions obtained by our proposal are superior to those of other algorithms in terms of quality indicators and speed of execution. Algorithms, datasets and evaluation framework have been made available to the research community.}

The approach employs the finite element Galerkin method, complemented by stabilization terms from Streamline-Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) and Pressure-Stabilizing/Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG). Equal-order linear triangular finite elements were used, and due to the nonlinear characteristic of the problem, for the solution procedure, the predictor multi-corrector algorithm was employed. Synthetic problems, serving as benchmarks, were formulated and equipped with fabricated analytical solutions to verify our proposed solutions. The study contributes to understanding the application of those techniques in the computational treatment of fluid flow problems in porous medium. The utilization of synthetic problems with known analytical solutions enhances the confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our proposed finite element solution.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) technology has become an integral part of today’s industries forming the Industrial IoT (IIoT) initiative, where industries are leveraging IoT to improve communication and connectivity via emerging solutions like data analytics and cloud computing. Unfortunately, the rapid use of IoT has made it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Therefore, protecting these systems is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a federated transfer learning (FTL) approach to perform IIoT network intrusion detection. As part of the research, we also propose a combinational neural network as the centerpiece for performing FTL. The proposed technique splits IoT data between the client and server devices to generate corresponding models, and the weights of the client models are combined to update the server model. Results showcase high performance for the FTL setup between iterations on both the IIoT clients and the server. Additionally, the proposed FTL setup achieves better overall performance than contemporary machine learning algorithms at performing network intrusion detection.}

	abstract = {Healthcare is one of the foremost applications of machine learning (ML). Traditionally, ML models are trained by central servers, which aggregate data from various distributed devices to forecast the results for newly generated data. This is a major concern as models can access sensitive user information, which raises privacy concerns. A federated learning (FL) approach can help address this issue: A global model sends its copy to all clients who train these copies, and the clients send the updates (weights) back to it. Over time, the global model improves and becomes more accurate. Data privacy is protected during training, as it is conducted locally on the clients’ devices.However, the global model is susceptible to data poisoning. We develop a privacy-preserving FL technique for a skin cancer dataset and show that the model is prone to data poisoning attacks. Ten clients train the model, but one of them intentionally introduces flipped labels as an attack. This reduces the accuracy of the global model. As the percentage of label flipping increases, there is a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We use a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the most optimal accuracy for the model. Although FL can protect user privacy for healthcare diagnostics, it is also vulnerable to data poisoning, which must be addressed.}

	abstract = {Many of today’s Big Data systems are developed in the Java programming language and require fast object serialization and deserialization for efficient and high-speed message exchange. We address this by introducing Skema, a library providing high-performance serialization of Java objects. Skema works based on Ahead-of-Time schema generation, so that only a minimal number of operations need to be performed at runtime to serialize an object. This approach allows Skema to also serialize individual objects only partially which is a great advantage for network communications with fixed buffer sizes. Furthermore, targeted optimizations, such as caching the size of the serialized form of objects that have a fixed size so that they do not have to be recomputed for each operation, are presented. In addition to a more in-depth explanation of the implemented procedures, this paper also presents benchmark results comparing the Skema library against Kryo, FST and the native Java serialization function. The results of these experiments achieve very good values in comparison with the remaining libraries. For example, one experiment shows that there can be nearly a hundredfold increase in the speed of deserializing objects when compared to the native Java serialization mechanism by using Skema. We also show that deserializing objects using the native Java mechanism requires a large amount of additional memory per operation, which puts a burden on the garbage collector afterwards. Finally, to investigate the scalability of the implemented solution, the benchmarks are also performed using different numbers of threads and the results are presented graphically.}

	abstract = {Fluid antennas located at the user device (UD) can exploit the natural multipath propagation and randomness of the desired data by adjusting its position spatially to find the point at which an interference null occurs. A fast fluid antenna multiple access (f-FAMA) system uses a large antenna array at the base station to transmit each user’s signal from each antenna. The interference is then overcome by a single fluid antenna located at each receiving UD. Previous work has established a channel model for such a f-FAMA system with a technique that estimates the best port for the fluid antenna to receive the signal at every symbol instance. This paper proposes an improved version of the channel model by also taking into consideration the difference in path loss between different ports and also looks into how different fluid antenna architectures effect the performance of an f-FAMA system. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of considering path loss variations, particularly in scenarios where there are substantial differences in distances from the transmitter to different ports. Additionally, among the three different antenna architectures considered, the performance of the wheel topology antenna is worse than the linear topology and circular topology antennas at shorter reference distances.}

	abstract = {This study examines the challenges hindering the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in Pakistan's construction industry and compares such challenges with those facing the construction industry in Ireland. The focus is on lessons learned from Ireland’s BIM journey, which commenced in earnest with the establishment of the Irish National BIM Council (NBC) in 2016, and continues through to the current initiative known as the Build Digital Project (2022-2026). The implications of such initiatives are considered in terms of addressing the challenges in driving the digital transformation of the Irish construction and built environment sector, promoting a more innovative, efficient, and sustainable industry. Insights relevant to Pakistan’s construction industry were established through a review of literature and a survey of experienced professionals. Results show that a lack of education and training, as well as low levels of awareness of BIM benefits, were identified as the most significant barriers to BIM adoption in Pakistan’s construction sector, whereas in Ireland, lack of client awareness, and lack of standardisation are the most significant barriers along with the aging of Irish workforce and the availability of new graduates. These findings offer valuable insights for academics, professionals, and policymakers seeking to understand and support the digital transformation of the construction industry.}

It consists of eight Raspberry Pi devices interconnected to each other so that they can run jobs in parallel. To make it easier to show how it works, a web application has been developed. It allows launching parallel applications and accessing a monitoring system to see the resource usage when these applications are running. The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) are used as demonstration applications. From this web application a couple of educational videos can also be accessed.

	abstract = {HPC and cloud data centers offer an increasing amount of cores per CPU, GPUs and high-speed networks like InfiniBand with up to 400 Gbit/s. Scaling out big-data computing is mostly limited by the network performance. However, many big data frameworks are written in Java (often using netty), which cannot fully exploit the performance of such networks. The reason is found in Java NIO, which is based on traditional sockets, while InfiniBand provides ibverbs, a totally different interface, to the operating system and applications. This challenge has been addressed by different approaches, providing transparent and non-transparent acceleration via high-speed NICs, many of them no longer maintained.In this paper, we propose hadroNIO, a Java library, providing transparent network acceleration for Java NIO applications, based on Unified Communication X (UCX). The latter is written in C, providing efficient access to different network technologies. hadroNIO has been extended to use Infinileap for efficiently accessing UCX. Infinileap is using the new Foreign Function & Memory APIs of Oracle’s Project Panama to access native code.Our evaluation results show, that hadroNIO allows netty to achieve round-trip times of less than 5 μs on a 100 GBit/s network and efficiently handle hundreds of connections per server. We compare the raw performance of hadroNIO with traditional Java sockets and libvma using a netty microbenchmark and include experiments with gRPC and Apache ZooKeeper. The measurements show, that hadroNIO outperforms existing solutions, while being transparent for applications and developers.}

The proposed approach applies the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to solve the problem and the Asymmetric Gaussian Distribution (AGD) for population initialization. Compared with existing methods, MOFP shows competitiveness in terms of a balance of objectives between compression rates, computing power, and prediction accuracy. In addition, the search result of MOFP is a Pareto Front, which eliminates the need for multiple searches to obtain architectures with different compression rates, significantly improving overall search efficiency. The results show that the use of AGD for population initialization can enhance the search process by effectively exploring the search space, leading to higher quality results.}

	abstract = {Conventional pruning techniques typically focus on evaluating a single structure in the network, such as the convolutional layer or batch normalization layer, to identify pruning targets. However, this approach fails to effectively leverage the potential of all structures within each layer of the network. In order to comprehensively consider the various structures in each layer, we propose a novel method called Soft Hybrid Filter Pruning using a Dual Ranking Approach (DR-SHFP), which builds upon Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) by introducing a dual-ranking approach. DR-SHFP incorporates a ranking system that assigns a rank to each filter in a collaborative manner, taking into account both convolutional layers and batch normalization layers. By simultaneously evaluating both types of layers, our method captures more information from the layer structures, overcoming the limitations of single-structure evaluation. Consequently, DR-SHFP can identify and select filters more effectively for pruning, leading to improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DR-SHFP on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. The proposed method outperforms other soft pruning methods, showcasing its capability to achieve excellent performance in various settings.}

	abstract = {Misinformation can seriously impact society, affecting anything from public opinion to institutional confidence and the political horizon of a state. Fake News (FN) proliferation on online websites and Online Social Networks (OSNs) has increased profusely. Various fact-checking websites include news in English and barely provide information about FN in regional languages. Thus the Urdu FN purveyors cannot be discerned using fact-checking portals. State-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for Fake News Detection (FND) count upon appropriately labelled and large datasets. FND in regional and resource-constrained languages lags due to the lack of limited-sized datasets and legitimate lexical resources. The previous datasets for Urdu FND are limited-sized, domain-restricted, publicly unavailable and not manually verified where the news is translated from English into Urdu. In this paper, we curate and contribute the first largest publicly available dataset for Urdu FND, "Ax-to-Grind Urdu", to bridge the identified gaps and limitations of existing Urdu datasets in the literature. It constitutes 10,083 fake and real news on fifteen domains collected from leading and authentic Urdu newspapers and news channel websites in Pakistan and India. FN for the Ax-to-Grind dataset is collected from websites and crowdsourcing. The dataset contains news items in Urdu from the year 2017 to the year 2023. Expert journalists annotated the dataset. We benchmark the dataset with an ensemble model of mBERT, XLNet, and XLM-RoBERTa. The selected models are originally trained on multilingual large corpora. The results of the proposed model are based on performance metrics, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall and MCC value. F1-score of 0.924, accuracy of 0.956, precision of 0.942, recall of 0.940 and an MCC value of 0.902 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for Urdu FND. Comparison analysis with SOTA ML and DL models and existing Urdu benchmark datasets exhibit that the ensemble model outperforms them for Urdu FND. The dataset used for our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/HjH-Whu-CRC/Ax-to-Grind-Urdu for further analysis and validation.}

	abstract = {Every year, plant parasitic nematodes, one of the major groups of plant pathogens, cause a significant loss of crops worldwide. To mitigate crop yield losses caused by nematodes, an efficient nematode monitoring method is essential for plant and crop disease management. In other respects, efficient nematode detection contributes to medical research and drug discovery, as nematodes are model organisms. With the rapid development of computer technology, computer vision techniques provide a feasible solution for quantifying nematodes or nematode infections. In this paper, we survey and categorise the studies and available datasets on nematode detection through deep-learning models. To stimulate progress in related research, this survey presents the potential state-of-the-art object detection models, training techniques, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics for deep learning beginners. Moreover, seven state-of-the-art object detection models are validated on three public datasets and the AgriNema dataset for plant parasitic nematodes to construct a baseline for nematode detection.}

	abstract = {Data quality plays a crucial role in the data governance of organizations, as it is essential to ensure that data are fit for the purpose for which they are intended, whether for operational activities, decision-making processes, or strategic planning. As data silos begin to be integrated to form data spaces, guaranteeing data quality becomes a necessity to achieve a reliable collaborative ecosystem. Nevertheless, the concept of data quality remains ambiguous, with various definitions and interpretations offered in the literature, despite its importance. This lack of consensus has led to the need for a thorough review of the different data quality criteria used in scientific work. Therefore, this paper serves as a systematic survey aimed at exploring and consolidating diverse perspectives on data quality. By thoroughly analyzing existing literature, this study compiles a comprehensive set of 30 agreed-upon data quality criteria, with their respective names and definitions. These criteria act as a valuable resource for organizations seeking to establish effective data quality monitoring practices. Then, we expose challenges raised by collaborative data processing and highlight possible research directions where data quality plays a major role.}

	abstract = {Automatic recognition of signals occupies an essential place in railway self-driving systems. Signal recognition systems help drivers avoid human factor accidents from fatigue and distraction of train drivers. In computer vision, developing object recognition algorithms is an important area of research related to transportation. This field is evolving exponentially with the help of deep learning, high-performance cameras, and reliable datasets. Nevertheless, the complexity of the states and combinations of railway signals has led traditional object recognition algorithms based on a single image as a dataset to add more structure to the recognition of one of the states of the signals described as "Blinking". This paper investigates a neural network based on YOLOv8 with a recurrent mechanism that extracts spatio-temporal contextual features expressed by scintillation signals. This research compensates for the lacunae in the railway transportation industry in terms of deep learning based approach in recognizing scintillation traffic signals. We enhance the training speed with a dual-channel parallel training structure and design an Ultra Fast Feature Extraction Module. Our network model implements real-time inference on 20fps video.}

	abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) applications face challenges in understanding and processing region or industry specific language. In real-world scenarios, conversational language used in blogs and social media platforms often contains slang and non-standard words (SNSW). These unconventional terms are not typically present in curated datasets used to train NLP models. As a consequence, the performance of these models is negatively affected when they encounter such real-world linguistic variations. In this paper, we introduce SNSW-DB, an automatically curated, regularly updated, large-scale lexical database from crowdsourced dictionaries. The database contains SNSW terms, example sentences, and their standard English synonyms generated by our synonym generator module. We also propose a transformer-based translation system that converts articles with SNSW to standard English. Translated documents enhance readability and utility for human readers, and can improve the performance of downstream NLP tasks.}

The premises of equatricism presented in this research paper have shown that successful website participation is achieved through the owners reducing the amount of discomfort an actor will experience and maximizing the gratification the actor will experience. It is possible for a website to pass criteria for general usability, as with Google’s Gmail service, but for the personal usability criteria to not be met.

In this paper, the interference and reliability issues are investigated among Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy is one of the most popular wireless protocols in the 2.4 GHz frequency band nowadays. There have been multiple studies investigating its performance under interference. However, these studies mostly follow some commonly adopted assumptions. For instance, the location of the interference source does not vary the performance metrics of the connection; the data exchange scheme does not impact the performance metrics of the connection; the performance metrics are the same on both sides of a Bluetooth Low Energy connection. Unfortunately these assumptions are never validated. As a result, this paper aims to verify/challenge these commonly adopted assumptions through experiments. According to the experiment results, the impact of the device role in the BLE connection, the data exchange scheme within the BLE connection, and the location of the interference source is investigated and discussed. This paper should be considered as a cornerstone for other research related to Bluetooth Low Energy performance under interference. It can also be used as a preliminary guideline when deploying Bluetooth Low Energy communication in an interference environment.}

However, seamlessly integrating heterogeneous agents and making them interact and collaborate still arise challenging issues. In this paper, we define a ROS 2 based software architecture that allows to build incarnated heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS) in a generic way. We showcase its effectiveness through a scenario integrating aerial drones, quadruped robots, and human operators (see https://youtu.be/iOtCCticGuk). In addition, agent spatial awareness in unknown outdoor environments is a critical step for realizing autonomous individual movements, interactions, and collaborations. Through intensive experimental measurements, RTK-GPS is shown to be a suitable solution for achieving the required locating accuracy.}

Thus, a method for parallelizing autonomous-driving software using the Model-based Development (MBD) process was proposed. The parallelized code for autonomous-driving software can be generated semi-automatically. The proposed method realizes the generation of code that assumes operation on real-world hardware and reduces execution time.}

	abstract = {Autonomous-driving software is increasingly based on Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, middleware for developing robotic applications. This paper proposes a performance evaluation framework for arbitrary nodes of Autonomous-driving software. The proposed framework empowers ROS 2 application developers to evaluate particular nodes requiring evaluation efficiently. The proposed framework can activate each node by considering the logic when the application is run as a whole. In addition, input data specific to each node are required for node evaluation. Because each node exchanges various types of data, generating input data to evaluate a particular node can be difficult. Thus, the proposed framework generates input data suitable for node evaluation. The proposed framework also provides a graphical user interface (GUI). A developer can easily evaluate arbitrary nodes by manipulating the proposed framework on the GUI. Experimental results show that the proposed framework successfully activates the evaluation target node and evaluates arbitrary nodes of autonomous-driving software. In addition, each functionality of the proposed framework is demonstrated to be working properly. The results of user functionality testing of the proposed framework demonstrate its usefulness.}

	abstract = {Pattern matching in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is one of the most critical and time-consuming elements, allowing the system to make decisions based on the real-time threats across the network. A pattern-matching method can be software-based or hardware-based. In this paper, a hardware implementation of bit-split algorithm has been discussed for pattern matching in order to detect unwanted traffic for a maximum number of rulesets. A hardware-based string matching scheme has been preferred here due to its fast speed and quick data parallelism for the high-performance Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The prototype of the detection method is implemented on Spartan SP605 with a small number of rules. For a large number of rules, a multi-scale Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based hardware architecture has been implemented in which we have used NetFPGA-SUME. This FPGA board has examined incoming packets at a bit rate of 1.25 Gb/sec with an operational frequency of 156.25MHZ. Furthermore, high-level data parallelism has been implemented by instantiating more than one match engine for handling multiple packets to achieve high throughput (T p ).}

	abstract = {Deploying large deep neural networks (DNNs) on IoT and mobile devices poses a significant challenge due to hardware resource limitations. To address this challenge, an edge-cloud integration technique, called split computing (SC), is attractive in improving the inference time by splitting a single DNN model into two sub-models to be processed on an edge device and a server. Dynamic split computing (DSC) is a further emerging technique in SC to dynamically determine the split point depending on the communication conditions. In this work, we propose a DNN architecture optimization method for DSC. Our contributions are twofold. (1) First, we develop a DSC-aware mixed-precision quantization method exploiting neural architecture search (NAS). By NAS, we efficiently explore the optimal bitwidth of each layer from a huge design space to construct potential split points in the target DNN – with the more potential split points, the DNN architecture can more flexibly utilize one split point depending on the communication conditions. (2) Also, in order to improve the end-to-end inference time, we propose a new bitwidth-wise DSC (BW-DSC) algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal split point among the potential split points in the mixed-precision quantized DNN architecture. Our evaluation demonstrated that our work provides more effective split points than existing works while mitigating the inference accuracy degradation. Specifically in terms of the end-to-end inference time, our work achieved an average of 16.47% and up to 24.36% improvement compared with a state-of-the-art work.}

	abstract = {Previous attempts to bring the data of the internet to environments that do not have continuous connectivity to the internet have made use of special hardware, which requires an additional expenditure on installation. Instead of acquiring special hardware, we take advantage of the ubiquity of Android smartphones and build a secure, software-only infrastructure on top of it called Disconnected Data Distribution (DDD) to exchange application data between disconnected Android phones and corresponding internet services. Although DDD draws ideas from Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN), we show how our internet data distribution approach simplifies the DTN architecture while providing stronger guarantees than standard DTN approaches. We design DDD to be inexpensive to deploy and maintain, so it takes an entirely software-only approach to build the infrastructure. The data transporters and clients all run on unmodified Android phones.}

Clear explanations of the AI system’s operations and decision-making process are vital, enabling users to comprehend the factors influencing predictions and recommendations. This paper introduces a novel explainable framework tailored for AAL, representing a structured approach to comprehensively understand feature importance in the decision-making process of machine learning models. The framework adopts a hierarchical approach, commencing with an overview of feature importance for the entire AAL system (Tier 0) and subsequently organising explanations into smaller subsets (Tiers 1, 2 and 3) based on user-defined measures, such as accuracy, activity types in AAL, and specific time periods. By facilitating metadata exploration and offering in-depth insights, the proposed framework augments model interpretability and user trust, ultimately empowering informed decision-making within AAL contexts.}

	abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have long been utilized in systems benefiting from hardware acceleration of processes unsuitable for execution on a traditional processor. Accordingly, as much of the world pivots from on-site datacenters and computing resources to hybrid or cloud based platforms, Multi-processing System-on-Chip (MPSoC) FPGAs are increasingly being employed in cloud computing systems to speed up many computation-intensive applications. In cloud computing, multi-tenant FPGAs are constantly space- and time-shared among multiple tenants dynamically by leveraging the partial reconfiguration property of FPGAs. With increasing security and privacy concerns introduced by these memory-based volatile devices, most countermeasures rely on encryption and decryption engines such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cores for user data protection. However, their high-resource requirements and long latency limit the number of such engines that can be implemented in hardware. They often become a performance bottleneck during peak time. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for aperiodic tasks to dynamically share multiple AES cores and hence to improve their utilization and overall system performance. Extensive experimental measurements on an FPGA development board featuring a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism.}

Machine learning has played a pivotal role in the detection and mitigation of these attacks over the years. However, to identify the zero-day attacks and incorporate frequently changing attack scenarios, techniques need to be developed that can work with minimally labeled data. In this paper, we propose Time aware LSTM Autoencoder-based learning approach to detect the attack in network flows by training the model using only normal traffic and using reconstruction error as the parameter to classify the attack event. We perform the experiments on different recent datasets like CICDDoS2019, & CICIDS2018 and experimental results exhibit that the proposed model overall provides better classification metrics.}

	abstract = {In the Internet of Vehicles, low service delay and fast response are two essential factors to ensure the safety and smooth operation of vehicle networking. As core technologies, the 5G and edge computing networks play a fundamental role in reducing the pressure on the backbone network of vehicle networking and decreasing the service exchange delay. The previous edge server placement strategy can not be directly applied to deploying vehicle networking services, resulting in the degradation of system performance and user quality of experience. To solve the above problem, we propose a reliable edge server deployment algorithm called CFD based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Firstly, the Canopy algorithm is used to cluster the location information of roadside units, and the initial cluster number is obtained. Then, the fuzzy C clustering algorithm (FCM) is leveraged to remove the "noise" and acquire the roadside units’ initial division and priority matrix. Finally, based on the DDPG algorithm, the optimal division of roadside units is obtained, and the cluster center is utilized as the deployment location of the edge server. Many experiments have been conducted, and the results show that, compared with the benchmark algorithm, the CFD algorithm improves the load balancing degree by 25%.}

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant cause of global mortality; thus, early intervention of CVDs can prevent their progression and effectively lower their death rate. However, one of the main obstacles to this is the lack of high-quality datasets for CVDs, which are essential for efficiently training machine learning prediction models. The available datasets are limited in size and have missing values and a high-class imbalance. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been shown to have high potential in producing medical synthetic tabular data, but the heterogeneity and complex dependencies of such data present challenges. This study proposes an enhanced sampling approach that aims to improve the quality of synthetic data and their resemblance to the original data distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on a medical dataset containing demographic, clinical and laboratory data from patients with CVDs. As part of the examination process, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing it with the data generated from the CTGAN. Our results show a higher degree of similarity between the distributions of the generated data and the real datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed sampling approach. The synthetic data generated by our model closely resembles the statistical properties of real data and shows strong potential for improving data quality. By accurately capturing the patterns and features of cardiovascular disease data, our model can contribute to enhancing the CVD risk prediction model.}

	abstract = {On-device learning, such as federated learning, is gaining more popularity. It benefits users with faster inference and privacy preservation. However, the heterogeneity of personal devices makes its deployment not easy. With the increasing need for an on-demand learning platform, the web browser has become one of the leading solutions due to its availability and interoperability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on evaluating the behaviour of federated learning on web browser platforms. This includes evaluating their compatibility, convergence in inference results, and performance. Our paper tries to address these concerns. Throughout our experiments, we found that there are still inconsistencies in inference results, compatibility issues, and varied performance among these platforms. Besides experiment analysis on this subject, we also recommend a model-platform-device compatibility report as our contribution.}

After an epidemic outbreak, countries usually implement a series of epidemic prevention and control policies to restrict personnel travel. This paper aims to measure the impact of national epidemic prevention and control policies on mobility change. To achieve this goal, we propose a mobility change prediction model based on LSTM and "local" fully connected layers. The results show that the model’s mobility change predictions in the six mobility categories are consistent with reality, and the model is optimal overall.}

	abstract = {As air pollution continues to pose a growing threat to human health and environmental well-being, accurate forecasting of pollutant concentration has become increasingly important. Existing prediction models can be divided into two categories: non-machine learning models and machine learning models. Nonmachine learning models excessively rely on historical data, while machine learning models have high time complexity and require large amounts of data. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a spatial distance optimization-based model for predicting pollutant concentration. The proposed model uses a neural network for predicting pollutant concentration, with the nonlinear activation increasing the model's ability to fit nonlinear data. Additionally, it proposes a spatial distance optimization strategy that divides the surrounding monitoring stations based on their distance from the target station. As the neural network model deepens, the influence of more distant monitoring stations on the predicted values gradually reduces. The proposed model adapts the weights based on training errors, implicitly learning the distribution of the relationship between station distances and concentration values and fully exploiting the intrinsic information of the data. Simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve a prediction accuracy up to 6.38% higher than traditional methods.}

Artificial intelligence technology is widely applied in various fields due to its capacity to emulate human thinking and learning. Focusing on the creation of cinematic culture, contemporary film production has gradually shifted towards digitization in its processes and virtualization in its content. Consequently, the continuous iterative development of digital filmmaking technology has presented further opportunities for integration with artificial intelligence technology.In the context of virtual production technology expanding to encompass the entire filmmaking process, this paper aims to explore artificial intelligence image technology from the perspective of digital cinema. It elucidates the application characteristics of artificial intelligence technology in the realm of imagery under the current cinematic aesthetics, delves into the future visual marvels constructed by films in the era of artificial intelligence, and thereby further explores the impact of artificial intelligence image technology on the creative concepts of future digital filmmaking, along with the insights and reflections derived from this exploration.}

	abstract = {Keeping pets can help people regulate their emotions, engage in physical activity, and cultivate friendships, all of which contribute to enhancing their overall quality of life. Based on a survey, pets are often left alone at home for an average of 8 hours, as their owners typically depart early and return late. Nonetheless, the current pet feeding systems available on the market exhibit issues like a restricted field of view, unreliable network connections, sluggish pet recognition speed, and subpar accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a more intelligent and efficient pet feeding system. This system leverages the fast and compact ResNet18 model and utilizes Jetson Nano and STM32F407ZGT6 chips to achieve pet image acquisition and species recognition functionalities. We employ the MQTT protocol to enable the uploading of environmental data and have designed a user-side webpage for convenient remote monitoring and timely checking of the pet’s status. Furthermore, we implement an end-to-end interaction design, allowing users to remotely and flexibly adjust factors such as the amount of pet feeding, environmental temperature, humidity, and other related information. Lastly, we conducted real-world deployment and testing of the system in various households, achieving a remarkable pet recognition accuracy of 98.65%. This system effectively fulfills the requirements for a scientific, automated, and efficient approach to pet care in daily life.}

	abstract = {In recent years, computer networks and telecommunications in general have been shifting paradigms to adopt software-centric approaches. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is one of such paradigms that centralizes control and intelligent applications can be defined on top of this architecture. In the literature, diverse software-based applications exist, focusing on finding either the shortest paths, balancing the traffic, and others. However, they do not consider the potentially different level of security of links in the network. In this work, we propose an approach for Flow Admission and Routing under Minimal Security Constraints (FARSec) in Software Defined Networks, where network flows must use links which are at least as secure as their required security level. We prove that FARSec can find feasible paths respecting the minimum level of security for each flow. If the latter is not possible FARSec rejects the flow in order not to compromise its security. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed approach is polynomial. Experimental results with semi-random generated graphs confirm the efficiency and correctness of the proposed approach. Finally, we implement the proposed solution using OpenFlow and ONOS – an SDN open-source controller. We validate its functionality using an emulated network with various security levels.}

	abstract = {In the current big data era, recommendation systems play an important role in our daily life to help us make faster and better decisions from massive numbers of choices. Personalized recommendation has gained its popularity as it provides recommendations according to the user profile, preferences and/or interests. Many existing systems make recommendation by centralizing data. However, the exposure of sensitive data raises a privacy concern as research has shown that it is possible to de-identify anonymous users. Examples include inferring sensitive information (e.g., political views, sexual orientations) from non-sensitive data (e.g., movie ratings). In this paper, we present a personalized privacy-preserving recommendation system called Trust-based Agent Network (TAN). It tackles the privacy issue by semi-decentralizing data and treating each node in the network as an agent. As such, data are distributed to each agent within each trusted network, and the recommendation service provider collects only obfuscated data from agents by adopting the differential-privacy mechanism. Consequently, data in our TAN are either protected inside local trusted networks or obfuscated outside of trusted networks. Final recommendation can then be made by aggregating the local suggestions from the trusted network and obfuscated global suggestions from the service provider. Personalized recommendations can be made by putting more emphasize on local suggestions. Evaluation results show that our TAN leads to high accuracy and highly personalized recommendations while protecting privacy.}

	abstract = {In the evolution process of cyberattack-defense confrontation, both sides have always been in a state of mutual confrontation and collaborative development, continuously upgrading their tools to improve adversarial capabilities. However, in this arms race, the positions of the both sides are imbalanced. As the party actively initiating the attack, attackers always is able to actively adjust the attack strategy based on the detected defense vulnerabilities to launch effective attacks. While the defenders always detecting defense vulnerabilities after suffering losses and filling them in a "patching" manner. This post awareness security protection strategy has a "fatal time difference" when dealing with unknown attacks. This paper aims to change the imbalanced state. Therefore, a attack confrontation model DTrap is proposed based on the concept of moving target defense, which introduce of high simulation trap hosts to achieve IP address and service port confusion. It can simulate real hosts to achieve various common network protocol requests and responses, and it can provide better dynamism than Honeypot when adjusting trap policies. DTrap can reverse the imbalance situation by increasing attack costs and promoting attack difficulty. We constructed a real adversarial environment, the security effectiveness of the DTrap model was evaluated through comprehensive and multi-dimensional experiments. The results indicate that DTrap can exert expected effectiveness in resisting network attacks of different dimensions, and effectively enhance the network attack confrontation ability.}

With the continuous development of blockchain technology, trustworthy oracles have become one of the hot research topics in the blockchain industry. This article reviews the current research status and challenges of trustworthy oracles, summarizing the major research progress in the oracle field in recent years from aspects such as architecture and key technologies. Based on this, we propose a system architecture called SmartLLM that allows smart contracts to call large language models based on a trustworthy oracle mechanism. There are two types of architectures: one is chain-native, and the other is a combination of on-chain and off-chain. This architecture provides technical support for smart contracts to use large language models, enriching the use cases of smart contracts.}

The integration of intelligent computer-aided systems can significantly aid radiologists in this endeavour. The present study centres on the development of a machine learning-oriented methodology aimed at detecting lung cancer through the analysis of text-based medical data extracted from authentic medical reports. The present dataset encompasses a range of machine learning algorithms that have been utilised for binary classification purposes. These algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Catboost. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal algorithm for the detection of lung cancer with the highest degree of accuracy. By means of comprehensive experimentation, the SVM and Logistic Regression models yielded the highest accuracy rates of 95% and 94%, respectively. The findings of this study indicate the capability of machine learning algorithms in the prompt identification of lung cancer, thereby facilitating enhanced diagnosis and timely intervention.}

	abstract = {Probability estimation models play an important role in various fields, such as weather forecasting, recommendation systems, and sports analysis. Among several models estimating probabilities, it is difficult to evaluate which model gives reliable probabilities since the ground-truth probabilities are not available. The win probability estimation model for esports, which calculates the win probability under a certain game state, is also one of the fields being actively studied in probability estimation. However, most of the previous works evaluated their models using accuracy, a metric that only can measure the performance of discrimination. In this work, we firstly investigate the Brier score and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a replacement of accuracy used as a performance evaluation metric for win probability estimation models in esports field. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel metric called Balance score which is a simple yet effective metric in terms of six good properties that probability estimation metric should have. Under the general condition, we also found that the Balance score can be an effective approximation of the true expected calibration error which has been imperfectly approximated by ECE using the binning technique. Extensive evaluations using simulation studies and real game snapshot data demonstrate the promising potential to adopt the proposed metric not only for the win probability estimation model for esports but also for evaluating general probability estimation models.}

	abstract = {Federated learning obtains the global model through the cooperative training of each participating device while protecting data privacy. However, the huge communication cost caused by each client sending complete model update becomes an important problem for its wide application. Model sparsification and quantization are practical solutions to reduce single-round uplink communication, respectively. However, when the compression ratio increases, (1) the current model sparsification methods based on fine granularity by uploading significant gradients are difficult to effectively select important parameters by using thresholds; (2) the unified bit-width quantization of parameters of layers with different importance in the model will lead to greater information loss. In this paper, we propose a joint compression framework based on functional structure sparsity and hybrid quantization sensing to compress the communication cost to more than two orders of magnitude. First, we proposed to take filters as sparse granularity through the visual analysis of parameter updating rules in the training process, and searched for filters with strong representational ability among filters with different representational abilities in the convolution layer. Second, we propose an adaptive layer-sensing quantization method according to the parameter distribution of each layer, which assigns different bit widths to different layers in the model after structural sparsification. Finally, we design a model aggregation and update scheme based on the above joint compression framework, which reduces the error caused by compression through model reconstruction and parameter reuse. Experiments show that our proposed framework compress single communication to more than two orders of magnitude in different tasks while ensuring the convergence speed and final model performance.}

However, conventional online signature verification models pose significant risks to data privacy, especially during training processes. To mitigate these concerns, we propose a novel federated learning framework that leverages 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for online signature verification. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework regarding 1-D CNN and federated learning. Particularly, the experiment results highlight that our framework 1) minimizes local computational resources; 2) enhances transfer effects with substantial initialization data; 3) presents remarkable scalability. The centralized 1-D CNN model achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.33% and an accuracy of 96.25%.

	abstract = {A wide range of respiratory diseases, such as cold and flu, asthma, and COVID-19, affect people’s daily lives worldwide. In medical practice, respiratory sounds are widely used in medical services to diagnose various respiratory illnesses and lung disorders. The traditional diagnosis of such sounds requires specialized knowledge, which can be costly and reliant on human expertise. Recently, cough audio recordings have been used to automate the process of detecting respiratory conditions. This research aims to examine various acoustic features that enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) models in detecting COVID-19 from cough signals. This study investigates the efficacy of three feature extraction techniques, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, and Spectral Contrast features, on two ML algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and thus proposes an efficient COVID-19 detection system. The proposed system produces a practical solution and demonstrates higher state-of-the-art classification performance with an AUC of 0.843 on the COUGHVID dataset and 0.953 on the Virufy dataset for COVID-19 detection.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are two critical enablers for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems. Sensing-aided communication enhancement (SACE) is one of the foreseeable scenarios of ISAC. This paper focuses on a RIS-assisted SACE (R-SACE) mechanism where the base station (BS) acts as a sensor and communicator. In particular, the RIS and the sensing at the BS assist in suppressing harmful direct interference and meanwhile reconstructing another feasible communication link. The average achievable capacity maximization problem of the RIS-assisted communication link is investigated by jointly optimizing the time resource allocation within a coherent ISAC time frame and the reflecting recoding of the RIS under the constraints of sensing performance and interference. Alternating algorithm (AO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are utilized to solve the above optimization problem. Simulation results validate the performance gains of the proposed R-SACE mechanism in suppressing interference and enhancing average achievable capacity.}

	abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensor data is a time series classification problem. The challenge lies in effectively managing spatial and temporal dependencies while highlighting crucial data variations. This can be accomplished through 3D skeleton data from an RGB+D camera. The hypothesis of this work is that representing 3D skeleton data as spatio-temporal graphs and utilizing graph embedding techniques and deep learning model, composed from Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), to learn relationships between joints, and Transformers to focus attention on relevant parts, will improve the performance of HAR. We opted to design this model utilizing a Hill Climbing approach. To facilitate real-time action recognition, we employed the sliding window approach. This method involves segmenting the continuous data stream of 3D skeletons, potentially sourced from a Kinect device, into sequences of uniform length. The article shows a significant improvement of the accuracy of the learning according to the state of the art.}

	abstract = {Ensuring customer preferences and needs are met while maintaining legal compliance has become a significant concern for software development organizations. Laws and regulations such as the LGPD in Brazil and the GDPR in the European Union emphasize incorporating personal data privacy rights from the initial stages of system development, extending throughout the entire data lifecycle. However, recent studies indicate that many companies still neglect data privacy in their development processes. Therefore, this research investigates how organizations integrate personal data privacy into their software development processes. A multiple case study was conducted involving five organizations of varying sizes and domains, and qualitative analysis techniques were applied to summarize the findings. The study identified that organizations primarily address data privacy issues in the later stages of the development process. This can be attributed to the need for personal data privacy specialists within the composition of the development teams and the absence of encouragement from organizations for employees to undergo relevant training and courses focused on data privacy. These findings help organizations understand how to improve their software processes to mitigate issues related to user privacy.}

	abstract = {As medical image analysis equipment has evolved and gained popularity, MRI has taken the forefront in radiological imaging. Since 3D medical images are more complex and contextual features are more difficult to capture, Transformer needs to be introduced to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network. We propose Dual Encoder U-Net (DEU-Net), which uses Transformer and CNN to extract medical image features in the encoder. Transformer is a pre-trained model in BTCV, which improves its ability to capture contextual features of medical images and increases the learning speed. To fuse the two kinds of features, we propose a Dual Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) to fuse the features extracted from the Transformer and CNN respectively, making full use of the feature extraction capabilities of the two extractors for 3D medical image. The results demonstrate that DEU-Net outperforms state-of-the-art for three segmentation tasks on the BraTS 2020 dataset.}

	abstract = {The effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, a critical strategy in cancer immunotherapy, is often limited by a high rate of primary resistance. Identifying patients likely to respond to this therapy is a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning model known as the Permutable Hybrid Zipped Network (PHZNet), which is specifically tailored for classifying patient responses to Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy. We achieved 89.67% accuracy on the transcriptomics public dataset from the Faculty of Pharmacy, Universit'e de Montr'eal, outperforming other excellent models. In addition, to explore interpretability, based on the concept of model distillation, we propose to use XGBoost gradient boosting decision trees to distill PHZNet and thus uncovering key gene features influencing therapy response. Our study provides a reliable basis for clinical decision-making by predicting whether patient benefits from ICB therapy across pan-cancer. Furthermore, it paves the way for understanding the ICB treatment response mechanism and provides critical gene targets for future immune treatment strategies.}

	abstract = {Biomedical commonsense question answering is a challenging learning task that aims to give correct answers to biomedical commonsense questions. Many works have used rule-based or deep learning approachs to accomplish this task. Recently, an extensive research path is that pre-trained language models combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve the accuracy of biomedical commonsense question answering. However, GNN is prone to the over-smoothing problem, causing the models to lose the ability to reason. In order to alleviate the over-smoothing problem and improve the inference ability for biomedical commonsense question answering, we propose a new end-to-end model named BiomGIN. In BiomGIN, we introduce the Graph Optimal Transport Networks (GOTNet) to use node-centroid attention to capture non-local messages in the knowledge graph, which alleviates the model over-smoothing problem. In addition, we design a question parsing module based on Transformer to generate linguistic instructions, which enhances the inference capability of the GNN. Finally, we evaluated our model on MedQA-USMLE dataset to compare with other baseline models. The experimental results demonstrate the method proposed in this paper achieves state-of-the-art results.}

This paper introduces a novel graph convolutional network, denoted as Semantic Dependency and Aspect Interaction Graph Convolutional Network(SDAIGCN), to overcome the limitations of existing graph-based sentiment analysis models in handling the semantic intricacies within aspectual phrases and the sentiment interactions among different aspects in a sentence. The SDAIGCN model achieves this by incorporating internal semantic correlations among aspect phrases through syntactic dependencies between context and aspect words in a sentence. Additionally, it associates affective interactions among different aspects to generate four types of adjacency matrix graphs. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model yields improvements in both accuracy and F1 score.}

However, one of the key technical weaknesses is the limited service duration of onboard battery-empowered UAVs. Aiming to prolong UAVs flight time, in this paper, UAVs flight energy consumption minimization problem is formulated along with a list of constraints. To solve the challenging problem, the original problem is decoupled into two subproblems, where the first one is solved by using the proposed modified differential evolution algorithm and the second subproblem is resolved by means of the proposed modified grey wolf algorithm. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The outcome obtained in this paper can be further extended to reliable indoor communication services, such as library indoor positioning and navigation and library emergency communications.}

	abstract = {Transcriptome prediction from genetic variation data is an important task in the privacy-preserving and biometrics field, which can better protect genomic data and achieve biometric recognition through transcriptome. Many transcriptome prediction methods have achieved good accuracy from genetic variation data. However, these traditional transcriptome prediction methods have the problems of linear assumption, overfitting, expose personal privacy, and extensive manual optimization. To solve these shortcomings, we propose an attention-based transcriptome prediction model from genetic variation named RATPM that improves the accuracy of transcriptome prediction and protects participant genomic data. In RATPM, we introduce and improve the deep learning model with multi-head self-attention into the transcriptome prediction stage of Predixcan, which uncovers the non-linear relationship between genetic variation and transcriptome. Moreover, we introduce a residual attention module to generate attention-aware features and extract more accurate features at different levels from genetic variation. Furthermore, we introduce the BERT pre-training module to encode genetic variation fully utilizing their contextual information. Our research enables scientific institutions to publish only predicted transcriptomic data for biometric purposes, thus protecting the genomic information of the subjects. Finally, we evaluated our model on the 1000 Genomes and Geuvadis projects datasets to compare with other baseline models.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces CM-RETS, a 4-Level address Communication Model designed specifically for real-time simulation of electromagnetic transients in power systems. CM-RETS incorporates a unique 4-Level address scheme and leverages Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology to enable efficient and reliable data exchanges between computing nodes in a distributed system. By effectively distributing computational load, CM-RETS facilitates faster and more realistic simulations, ensuring precise and timely data exchanges within a 5μs time step to capture transients in real time. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CM-RETS in achieving accurate and real-time simulations of electromagnetic transients. With its robust and cost-effective solution, CM-RETS provides researchers and engineers with the means to perform detailed analysis and studies on power systems under various transient conditions.}

	abstract = {The significant success of deep learning has sparked interest in its application in medical diagnosis. Some deep learning models have achieved expert-level accuracy on some medical datasets, but these models are rarely used in clinical practice due to the lack of interpretability. Therefore, the research topic of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to make the reasoning process of the model transparent and interpretable. In this case, we applied interpretable artificial intelligence to dermatoscopy image diagnosis for the first time. Specifically, we use an interpretable prototype network for dermoscopy image diagnosis. To solve the problem of weak generalization performance of a single network, we propose to construct a new prototype network using the dual-path network. Besides, we propose a new gate similarity calculation method to reduce the activation of low-similarity regions, thereby reducing the generation of inaccurate prototypes and improving the diagnostic ability of the model. We conducted experiments on the dermoscopy datasets HAM10000 to test the model and compare it with other baseline models. Experimental results show that DP-ProtoNet has made improvements in accuracy while preserving the interpretability of the model.}
