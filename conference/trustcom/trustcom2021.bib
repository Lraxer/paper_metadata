	abstract = {The emerging yet promising notion of trust amalgamated with the paradigm of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been of significant interest for researchers in both industry and academia. Trust management models are being widely employed in diverse domains seeking to mitigate multifarious insider attacks where dishonest entities counterfeit or alter the messages from legitimate users, subsequently, endangering the lives of drivers, passengers, and vulnerable pedestrians. While vehicles form opinions towards the fellow network participants, numerous influencing attributes in reference to the interactions among the vehicles are aggregated to develop a final belief on a target vehicle. The significance of these trust impacting attributes is often depicted by manually assigning a weight to each parameter. The aim of this research is to address the challenges of quantification of the influencing trust attributes and the weights associated with these parameters, subsequently, quantifying the aggregated trust. Furthermore, the time-based behavior of the aggregated trust along with the contributing parameters is also analyzed in this paper to study the behavior of each vehicle and to identify suitable trust-based patterns for safety-critical and non-safety vehicular applications. Performance analysis demonstrates that the trust values computed via the envisaged trust model are lower than those calculated via the benchmark scheme.}

	abstract = {Certificateless encryption solves the problems of key escrow in identity-based cryptography (IBC) and certificate management in traditional public key cryptography (PKC). This paper proposes a new verifiable certificateless public-key encryption scheme based on the conjunctive keywords, which can transfer files without using secure channels. The new authentication process developed in the scheme ensures the secure transmission of encrypted files in the open channel. At the same time, combining the conjunctive keyword into the scheme has the advantage of narrowing the scope of the query file and locating the file we need quickly and accurately. Furthermore, the strong security of our scheme is further analyzed and proved: in the random oracle model, the double indistinguishable characteristics of ciphertext and trapdoor are satisfied. We compared with other schemes in terms of performance analysis. Experiments show that the execution time and key size of our scheme can be reduced by a certain percentage in the Encryption, Trapdoor, and Test phases, which indicates that the structure of this scheme is more concise and has better security.}

	abstract = {Wireless IoT networks are becoming increasingly prevalent for sensing and actuating in a range of sophisticated applications, such as smart homes and smart cities. For various reasons, including auditability, debugging and performance tracking, event logging is essential in such networks. However, most current research has assumed that nodes always behave correctly. Yet, nodes in open IoT networks may misbehave due to the presence of attackers. Hence, an understanding of the problem of event logging in the presence of Byzantine nodes is essential. In this paper, we propose two versions of event logging: strong and weak logging. We show a number of impossibility results and propose a distributed and centralised version of the weak event logging. We show that only a weak logging can be achieved probabilistically, and we propose, and prove correct, an algorithm to solve the problem.}

	abstract = {The blockchain technology is regarded as a significant trust-building technology and has attracted much attention from the public. The longest chain rule has been widely applied in blockchain systems to reach consensus on the distributed ledger. However, the longest chain rule cannot support a higher transaction throughput due to its lower security. As an alternative solution to the longest chain rule, GHOST is proposed as a safer consensus rule. Existing studies show that the longest chain rule can suffer from selfish mining attacks. However, it is unclear how selfish mining attacks perform on GHOST. In this paper, we explore the performance of selfish mining on GHOST. We first propose the original selfish mining (GHOST-SM) and stubborn mining (GHOST-StuM) for GHOST. We then evaluate these two selfish mining strategies on our blockchain simulation system. The experimental result shows that GHOST achieves better security than the longest chain rule. However, when the block generation rate increases, the security of GHOST is close to the longest chain rule. For example, the threshold for selfish mining attacks of GHOST is increased by 47.55% and 0.60% compared to the longest chain rule corresponding to the block generation interval of 1 second and 15 seconds.}

	abstract = {M+ 1\\text{st} -price auction, also called Vickrey auction, is a type of sealed-bid auction to sell M identical goods. B bidders secretly choose a price from p bidding points as their bid. The top M bidders can buy the goods at the M+ 1\\text{st} bidding price. A trusted manager is commonly used to compare these sealed-bids. In our research, trusted manager and trusted mix servers used by mix and match are removed. Instead of cooperating all managers or bidders to find out the winning bidders, winning bidders prove that they are a winner by themself. By further adopt a greedy strategy on searching the M+ 1\\text{st} -price, the time complexity of each bidder can be reduced to O(P) , which is the same as most previous researches. Thus, we construct a scheme that removed the manager without increasing bidders' time complexity. The implementation shows that the gas usage reduced 87% from a manager architecture in a 3 bidder and 6 bidding price setting. The cost to participate in this auction is 12,000, 000P gas or 600P US dollars at this moment, which is enough practical.}

	abstract = {The payment channel networks (PCNs), as the main method of blockchain off-chain expansion, have received extensive attention in recent years. Using the PCNs, two unconnected parties in a transaction can forward payments through existing payment channels of other nodes, which dramatically reduces interactions with the blockchain. But in large-scale dynamic PCNs, the routing mechanism is a challenge. Existing PCNs routing algorithms have some limitations. The landmark routing destroys the decentralization of blockchain. The static routing requires nodes having a global view and ultra-high computing power, which can not be applied to light nodes. We propose VEIN, a dynamic multi-path source routing algorithm, which is suitable for not only full nodes but also light nodes. We present an ingenious routing protocol, a modified max-flow algorithm to find edge-disjoint paths, and a path selection algorithm to deal with the NP-hard multi-path selection problem. Extensive experiments show that VEIN increases the transaction success ratio by 34% with the state-of-art algorithm, and realizes multiple orders of magnitude reduction in storage. In addition, we implement a prototype of VEIN on the Ethereum testnet to verify its feasibility.}

	abstract = {Trust management offers a further level of defense against internal attacks in ad hoc networks. Deploying an effective trust management scheme can reinforce the overall network security. Regardless of limitations, however, security researchers often use numerical simulations to prove the merits of novel methods. This is due to the lack of an adequate testbed to evaluate the proposed trust schemes. Therefore, there is a demanding need to develop a generic testbed that can be used to evaluate the trust relationship for different networks and protocols. This paper proposes TrustMod, an NS-3 module consisting of three main components to evaluate the different trust relationships: direct trust, uncertainty, and indirect trust. It is designed to meet usability, generalisability, flexibility, scalability and high-performance requirements. A series of experiments involving 1680 simulations were performed to prove the design and implementation accuracy of TrustMod. The performance results show that TrustMod's resource footprint is minimal, even for very large networks.}

	abstract = {As an unsupervised data mining method, clustering can extract valuable information in complex and redundan-t network data analysis. However, the existing methods are sensitive to the selection of initial cluster centers, and cannot automatically determine the number of clusters, which fails to adapt to various types of network data. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a method of adaptive clustering ensemble based on uncertain entropy decision-making. Firstly, K-means is used as the base clustering algorithm of clustering ensemble, and several base clustering members are randomly generated according to different the number of clusters, and the members with high stability and quality are selected as clustering ensemble inputs. Furthermore, the uncertainty of clusters in the base clusterings are calculated based on the information entropy criterion, and then the co-association matrix is established. The obtained co-association matrix is transformed into a distance matrix by Bhattacharyya distance among data samples. Finally, we use the distance matrix as the input of the density peaks (DP) algorithm, and further calculate the final clustering result. The experimental results on real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed method has better performance than other clustering methods.}

	abstract = {The combination of D2D (Device to Device) communication and MEC (Mobile Edge Computing) architecture is adopted to reduce the communication delay in 5G. With the extensive use of HPS (high performance switch) as the main medium of data distribution in the device layer, the holistic power consumption and delay can be guaranteed stably, mainly because HPS has the mechanism of Master-Slave scheme to ensure the robustness. However, as far as we know, there are fewer studies to verify the safety validation of the design using formal methods. Hence, we study it through timed automata and model checking. This paper integrates HPS into D2D communication design in MEC, selects the Master-Slave synchronization and switchover scheme in HPS as the research object, describes the scheme based on timed automata, and then verifies seven fundamental but essential properties through the model checker UPPAAL. Through verification, comparison and analysis of possible scenarios in our constructed model, it can be concluded that the design of the HPS in MEC can conform to its required specification. Further, it can not only enhance the safety validation of the combination of D2D communication and MEC architecture, but also provide a guide for the newest subsequent high safety primary-backup design in industry.}

	abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN), as a key component of deep learning technology, plays a vital role in its development. Most major technology companies use deep neural network as a key component to build their artificial intelligence products and service. Building a deep neural network model requires us to pay a huge price: large-scale labeled data sets, a large number of computing resources, and highly specialized domain knowledge. Therefore, we believe that the model owner owns the intellectual property rights of the model, and it is very important to design a technology that protects the intellectual property rights of the deep neural network model and allows the owner to externally verify its copyright. Through statistical analysis of a large number of pre-trained network parameters, we propose an end-to-end network model protection framework-Deep Water based on the distribution of network model parameters. First, we propose a new research problem: embedding watermarks into deep neural networks. We also define the requirements for watermarking in deep neural networks, the embedding situation, and the types of attacks. Secondly, we propose a general framework for embedding the watermark into the parameter distribution function of each layer of the convolutional network. Our method does not harm the performance of the network where the watermark is placed, because the watermark is embedded when the host network is trained. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive experiment to reveal the potential of watermarking deep neural networks as the basis for this new research work. We proved that our framework can embed watermarks in the process of training deep neural networks from scratch and in the process of fine-tuning and distillation without compromising its performance. Even after migration learning and watermark overlay operations, the embedded watermark will not disappear. Even if 65% of the parameters are trimmed, the watermark remains intact.}

	abstract = {Certificates play a key role in TLS, which is by far the most widely used security protocol for protecting network traffic. Studies have shown that inappropriate usage of certificates may incur security and privacy risks, most of which are focused on the server-side certificates. However, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things that interconnects countless nodes over the world, as well as the Zero Trust philosophy that stresses authentication of every entity, the adoption of client certificates could be a lot more vital. According to our observation, many practical problems and security risks still exist in the deployment and use of client certificates. In this paper, we present a passive measurement of over 24 million client certificates, collected by a framework deployed on the CSTNET, one of the major academic backbone networks in China. By performing a comprehensive analysis of the large scale real-world data, we give a big picture of the client certificates usage in current network, and disclose implementation flaws of these certificates which may possibly harm transport layer security and user privacy. As many as 342,699 defective client certificates are unearthed, which is an important reminder that never should we neglect the correct use of certificates on the client side.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability reproduction paves a way in debugging software failures, which need intensive manual efforts. However, some key factors (e.g., software configuration, trigger method) are often missing, so we can not directly reproduce the failure without extra attempts. Even worse, highly customized configuration options of programs create a barrier for reproducing the vulnerabilities that only appear under some specific combinations of configurations. In this paper, we address the problem mentioned above - reproducing the configuration-related vulnerability. We try to solve it by proposing a binary similarity-based method to infer the specific building configurations via the binary from crash report. The main challenges are as follows: precise compilation option inference, program configuration inference, and source-code-to-binary matching. To achieve the goal, we implement RoBin, a binary similarity-based building configuration inference tool. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we test RoBin on 21 vulnerable cases upon 4 well-known open-source programs. It shows a strong ability in pinpointing the building configurations causing the vulnerability. The result can help developers reproduce and diagnose the vulnerability, and finally, patch the programs.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks pose a threat to privacy of web activity, especially on anonymity networks such as Tor. Recent studies show that the deep neural network (DNN) significantly improves the impact of website fingerprinting attacks. Especially, DNN-based attack undermines the existing defense methods which are mainly rely on the manually designed rule. In this paper, we present a novel defense that generates universal perturbation that can transform original examples to adversarial examples which is effectively defending against a specific WF model. The proposed defense is evaluated on state-of-the-art DNN attack over a public Tor traffic dataset. The experimental results show our adversarial example generation method performs better than the baseline methods. The proposed defense defeats all existing WF attacks based on deep neural networks with a low overhead. Comparing with state-of-the-art defenses such as Walkie-Talkie and WTF-PAD with a lower bound of 31% and 64% overheads, the proposed defense achieves identical defense performance with at least 50% bandwidth overhead saving.}

	abstract = {Designing and developing a true random number generator is a grand challenge for all time. It is highly necessitated in cryptography and various domains, such as simulation and other scientific applications. Therefore, various random number generators are emerging. Many true random number algorithms have already been proposed, which are very complex and require specific devices; for instance, a quantum random number generator depends on quantum devices. Moreover, diverse true random number generators are devised based on light, image, voltage, currents, etc., to achieve true randomness. Thus, it is a challenging task to generate a truly random number in any computing device. Therefore, we propose a general-purpose true random number generator for a conventional computing device, called Rando. The time complexity of Rando is O(m) , where m is the bit size of a random number, but it does not use extra spaces. Our proposed algorithm is a simple and straightforward true random number generator based on hashing techniques and system clocks yet powerful. Our experimental results show that Rando outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in randomness. Rando is validated its true randomness in NIST SP 800–22 and passes all 15 statistical tests of randomness.}

	abstract = {Millions of Android applications are now deployed on billions of smartphones and tablet devices. An enormous amount of users' private data are being collected and made accessible to such apps. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to smartphone app security. In particular, the current practice of the app markets and app security scanners is to ensure that the requested permissions are consistent with the used permissions. On the other hand, mobile apps need to seek consent from users to approve various permissions to access user information. However, users often blindly accept permission requests and apps start to abuse this mechanism. For example, a flashlight app may obtain users' locations and send them out to the server. As long as a permission is requested by the app developer and approved by the users, the state-of-art detection mechanisms will treat it as benign. In this paper, we ask the question “are the permission requests really necessary?” The question is difficult to answer because it is hard to autonomously “comprehend” whether a permission is needed for the functionality of the app. We take the first attempt to tackle this challenge by comparing an app's permission requests with its peer apps, i.e., apps with similar functionalities. An app that requests/uses significantly more permissions than its peers is considered potentially malicious that will require further investigation. With this idea, we design a statistical approach to identify potentially excessive permission requests and evaluate it with apps from Play Store. Experiment results and case studies show that the proposed mechanism could effectively identify highly suspicious apps, which request many permissions that are not relevant to their functionalities.}

	abstract = {With more devices being inter- or intra-connected, Internet of Things (IoT) has gradually been adopted in many disciplines, such as healthcare industry, coined as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The purpose of IoMT is to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of medical operations, i.e., remotely monitoring the status of patients. In such healthcare environments, smartphones have become an important device to communicate with others and update the information of patients, resulting in a special type of IoMT called Medical Smartphone Networks (MSNs). To reinforce the distributed architecture, trust management schemes are often implemented to defend against insider attacks. However, how to maintain the robustness of trust management in heavy traffic networks still remains a challenge, i.e., COVID-19 incident would cause excessive traffic for healthcare organizations and increase the difficulty of validating trustworthiness among MSN nodes. In this work, we focus on this issue and propose a blockchain-enabled adaptive traffic sampling method to help enhance the robustness of trust management under high traffic environments. The use of blockchain technology aims to build a verified database of malicious traffic among all nodes. The evaluation in a real healthcare environment demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of our approach.}

	abstract = {The Kernel Correlation Filter Tracking Algorithm(KCF)is a lightweight tracking algorithm with the advantages of fast tracking speed and good effect. However, when the target is occluded and the scale changes, the algorithm will have tracking drift and tracking loss. Aiming at the kernel-related filter tracking algorithm that cannot solve the tracking failure caused by occlusion, target scale changes and other factors in the tracking process, an anti-occlusion and scale-adaptive kernel-related filtering algorithm is proposed. We build a scale pool and use the scale pool to train a one-dimensional fast scale filter to solve the problem of target scale changes. This paper uses the average occlusion distance metric and the size of the context occlusion factor to determine the occlusion state of the target, and dynamically select the learning update rate of the target model according to the target occlusion state. When it is judged that the target is severely occluded, the target position is predicted according to the previous motion state of the target, and the small-range re-detection positioning mechanism proposed in this paper is used to re-detect the target within a certain range of the predicted position. At the same time, the re-detected target is occluded again Judgment to determine whether the target is out of the occlusion. If it is determined that the target is still severely occluded, it means that the target is not out of the occlusion area, the re-detection of the target position is inaccurate, and the predicted position is output. Experimental results show that the accuracy and success rate of the algorithm in this paper are 0.819 and 0.669, which are 8.33% and 7.04% higher than the KCF algorithm. The tracking effect of this algorithm is better than that of KCF algorithm.}

	abstract = {Establishing trust in the election outcome is a very important problem. In order to solve it, we propose a practical ranked choice online voting system where every user can verify the validity of the outcomes. The proposed system combines the use of public blockchain and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to ensure that all standard requirements for voting systems are met, and at the same time to provide protection against malicious adversaries with administrative access. Each cast vote is submitted to the Intel SGX via a secure communication channel. The SGX verifies the eligibility and validity of the vote and encrypts it inside the SGX enclave. Later on, only the fingerprints (i.e., the hash values) of the encrypted votes are published on the public blockchain ledger before the deadline of the election. All encrypted votes are released after the deadline. Every voter can self-tally all submissions in encrypted form using the homomorphic property of our encryption system. The proposed protocol also achieves end-to-end voter verification. Our theoretical security analysis and experimental results show that the protocol is secure and is more efficient than previous alternative voting protocols.}

	abstract = {The publish/subscribe(pub/sub) is an asynchronous messaging service or content distribution framework. For the idempotency it provides, pub/sub diagram is an efficient solution for large-scale content distributing systems, thus it is widely used in stock exchange systems or e-Health content sharing systems. Some wide-area applications require cross-domain pub/sub service, making it a natural choice to deploy on the public cloud. However, it would bring about security and privacy issues. Recent research proposes security enhancements to prevent thefts, such as searchable data encryption and attribute-based encryption, which allow the matching process to perform encrypted matching without learning the content of the publications and subscriptions. Besides the considerable performance loss, they could not resist the collusion attacks. If the malicious brokers collude with a malicious publisher or subscriber in a cross-domain environment, they can still infer the subscriptions of benign subscribers. We propose the MagikCube framework that provides confidentiality and integrity of the contents and also protects the privacy of the publishers and subscribers in cross-domain scenarios. Moreover, MagikCube can also resist the collusion attacks from malicious brokers in a cross-domain environment. It achieves these security goals by dynamically selecting and placing the sensitive data and some necessary components in enclaves protected by trusted hardware such as Intel SGX. Our experiment result shows that, compared with the baseline model, MagikCube does not introduce much overhead loss when providing better security for all the participants in the pub/sub system.}

	abstract = {The US Standard (EC)DSA is currently almost the most popular digital signature scheme. Chinese and Russian governments also proposed their counterparts: SM2 and GOST R 34.10 (GOST). Nowadays, there are already many industrial applications supporting SM2 and GOST digital signatures. Unfortunately, the existing analyses for SM2 and GOST are rather limited when compared to ECDSA. This paper focuses on the security of SM2 and GOST from the viewpoints of RKA security (related-key attack) and sKRKA security (strong known related key attack). RKA captures the real attacks of tampering and fault injection in hardware-stored secret keys. sKRKA, a recently proposed security model modified from RKA, captures the real attacks in the BIP-32 HD wallet and the stealth address used in Monero. It was proved that ECDSA is insecure in the RKA model (ICISC 2015) and but secure in the sKRKA model (NSS 2019). In this work, we proved that GOST is insecure in both RKA and skRKA models, but SM2 is secure in both RKA and sKRKA models. This result well differentiates the security of ECDSA, SM2 and GOST, and demonstrates that Chinese SM2 is capable to construct secure cryptocurrency systems using BIP-32 HD wallet or stealth address, as secure as ECDSA, but outperforms ECDSA in resisting tampering or fault injection attacks.}

	abstract = {At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr first proposes a deep learning based attack on round-reduced Speck32/64. It is an all-in-one differential approach under the Markov assumption. Then Baksi presents the method for non-Markov ciphers and applies it to Gimli by simulating the all-in-one differentials. However, all studies are still only for single-key differential distinguishers and the selection of input difference is based on traditional cryptanalysis. Inspired by the work of Gohr and Baksi, we extend and apply machine learning techniques to related-key differential distinguishers for the first time and propose a novel approach to develop (related-key) differential distinguishers without using prior cryptanalysis. We experimentally show that the differences with low Hamming weights are more suitable for building distinguishers. Then we present an exhaustive algorithm and a greedy algorithm to find an appreciable difference for the distinguisher. Finally, to obtain a suitable machine model for distinguishers, we adopt a Bayesian optimization tool named Hyperopt for parameter optimization and model selection. As proof of works, we apply our method to round-reduced Speck32/64, Present64/80 and get some improved cryptanalysis results.}

	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing, remote attestation of virtual machines has received extensive attention. However, the current schemes mainly concentrate on the single prover, and the attestation of a large-scale virtualization environment will cause TPM bottleneck and network congestion, resulting in low efficiency of attestation. This paper proposes CloudTA, an extensible remote attestation architecture. CloudTA groups all virtual machines on each cloud server and introduces an integrity measurement group (IMG) to measure virtual machines and generate trusted evidence by a group. Subsequently, the cloud server reports the physical platform and VM group's trusted evidence for group verification, reducing latency and improving efficiency. Besides, CloudTA designs a hybrid high concurrency communication framework for supporting remote attestation of large-scale virtual machines by combining active requests and periodic reports. The evaluation results suggest that CloudTA has good efficiency and scalability and can support remote attestation of ten thousand virtual machines.}

Therefore, well pre-trained DNN models are valuable intellectual property that we should protect. In this work, we propose DeepTrace, a framework for model owners to secretly fingerprinting the target DNN model using a special trigger set and verifying from outputs. An embedded fingerprint can be extracted to uniquely identify the information of model owner and authorized users. Our framework benefits from both white-box and black-box verification, which makes it useful whether we know the model details or not. We evaluate the performance of DeepTrace on two different datasets, with different DNN architectures. Our experiment shows that, with the advantages of combining white-box and black-box verification, our framework has very little effect on model accuracy, and is robust against different model modifications. It also consumes very little computing resources when extracting fingerprint.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the computation and processing of trajectories have attracted both academic and industrial communities to study and develop techniques and applications due to the popularization of mobile devices. To offload the data management, it is motivated to outsource the trajectory data to the cloud for achieving great cost savings and flexibility. However, directly outsourcing trajectory data may arise serious privacy concerns. To address the problem, we define the problem of the secure trajectory similarity search over encrypted trajectory data and propose a secure trajectory similarity search approach based on a bi-directional similarity measurement. In this approach, we first propose a secure squared point to line-segment distance computation protocol to facilitate the precious and secure trajectory similarity computations. Furthermore, to improve the search performance, we propose a secure trajectory filtering method based on signature matching to filter out the dissimilar trajectories before the expensive computations on the ciphertext. Based on the proposed protocols and methods, we present a signature-based secure trajectory similarity search processing algorithm to retrieve the similarity results without revealing information about the trajectories. Finally, we theoretically analyze the computational complexity and security guarantees of the proposed approach and conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to test the search performance under various experimental settings.}

	abstract = {It is difficult to provide semantic security for user data while using deduplication to save storage space in cloud storage. Some studies attempt to provide different levels of security for data according to their popularity for a reasonable trade-off between security and efficiency. However, existing schemes generally need a trusted third party to store deterministic data tags to record data popularity. If the trusted third party is compromised by adversaries, the deterministic tags will expose data information. In this paper, we propose a popularity-based secure deduplication scheme with fully random tags, which does not need to store deterministic tags. Our solution is using the homomorphic encryption to generate comparable random tags to record data popularity and using binary search to reduce time complexity of tag comparison to logarithmic time. Besides, we also design a proof of ownership protocol based on homomorphic encryption to prevent adversaries with only the data tag from tampering with the data popularity, which are not considered in the existing popularity-based schemes. We implement our scheme for system efficiency evaluation. Compared with the scheme of Stanek et al., our scheme has a slight improvement in encryption efficiency.}

	abstract = {Page tables are one of the key data structures in OS(Operating System) kernel. It plays an extremely important role in the memory access and protection. However, the page tables are fundamental weakness of operating system because they share the same address space with the vulnerable kernel, and thus subject to kernel data-only attack. To solve that, researchers have relied on the self-protection in the same kernel privilege level without introducing higher privilege layer for efficient world switch and effective page table protection. It needs to intercept and verify every update to kernel page tables. To improve the performance, it is required to reduce the time consumed for each interception as much as possible. In this paper, we propose an architecture to provide efficient page table protection based on Supervisor-mode Access Prevention (SMAP) hardware feature and Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI) from an untrusted kernel. SecPT maintains the kernel page tables which are actually used by the kernel in the protection domain and prevents the compromised kernel from subverting page table protection by abusing some privileged instructions. We have realized a prototype of the SecPT. The experimental results show that SecPT provides both effective and efficient page table protection.}

	abstract = {In recent years, edge computing (EC), as an emerging technology, has been widely used in various industries. It can meet the needs of industries in real-time business, application intelligence, security and privacy protection. However, edge devices may not always be trustworthy in the edge computing environment. Moreover, traditional edge computing systems have ignored the fact that the computation capability of user device can also be used. In this paper, we propose the Minimum Computation Latency Secure Edge Computing (MCLSEC) scheme to minimize computation latency and provide the security of computing data by utilizing linear coding and the resources of both edge devices and user device. Specifically, we consider the matrix multiplication as a computation task, which is an important module in many application operations, such as machine learning, big data analysis, etc. We firstly theoretically analyze the total computation latency of edge devices and user device in the coded edge computing. We then give the design of the MCLSEC scheme, which includes of the coding scheme and the task allocation scheme. Moreover, we also give theoretical analysis to show the proposed MCLSEC scheme is secure and optimal. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Compared with the existing schemes, MCLSEC scheme significantly reduces the computation latency of edge computing while ensuring data confidentiality.}

	abstract = {In Collaborative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS), vehicles send collaborative awareness messages (CAMs) carrying information such as speed, position, and identity, to interact with other vehicles, and thus, obtain transportation services. However, CAMs are broadcasted in plaintext over the unsafe network, which causes the leakage of vehicle's sensitive information when maliciously intercepted. At present, there is less scheme for encryption and anonymous authentication CAMs that is suitable for the actual scenario. In this paper, we propose a revocable zone encryption scheme with anonymous authentication. When vehicles enter the zone, the zone manager first completes the anonymous authentication according to the vehicle-generated join request containing a self-delegated certificate. Then, vehicles encrypt CAMs with the session key by symmetric encryption and wrap the session key with the zone key for secure communication. Besides, we use the complete subtree method to satisfy the revocation of the vehicle and zone key management respectively. Finally, simulation experiments and analysis show that our scheme provides stronger privacy-preserving compared with proposals that only support anonymous authentication. Differing from the similar scheme that tries to encrypt CAMs, our scheme not only satisfies more security requirements but also our key management is more feasible.}

	abstract = {With the widespread use of tunnel technology, the volume of encrypted tunnel traffic rises sharply, which brings a new challenge to traditional encrypted traffic identification. A number of real-world application scenarios, including Quality of Service and intrusion detection, have put forward new re-quirements for identifying numerous tunnels, applications, and fine-grained behavior. However, previous studies and datasets on encrypted tunnel traffic identification fail to meet these requirements due to their low dataset coverage and coarse label granularity. These weaknesses further affect the extracted features based on these datasets, making them unable to adequately characterize encrypted tunnel traffic. In this paper, we refine the previous tunnel traffic identification granularity from prevalent application identification to behavior identification, and propose LFETT2021, a large-scale fine-grained encrypted tunnel traffic dataset. Our dataset expands the coverage to two operating system platforms, five tunnels, 23 applications, and 76 behaviors. Furthermore, we propose a set of Time-Packet-Related features to better characterize encrypted tunnel traffic. Our comprehensive experiments on LFETT2021 and Time-Packet-Related features show the best average precision of 85% and recall of 88% in 3 different granularity identification scenarios.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the combination of edge computing and artificial intelligence has become a mainstream trend. Based on edge computing and image classification technologies, we design and implement a secure distributed image classification reasoning system for heterogeneous edge computing. The functions of the system consists of two parts: model distributed deployment and image classification reasoning. Firstly, we have designed three distributed deployment schemes for the model deployment on edge devices: random, static and dynamic deployment schemes. Secondly, we have designed three secure distributed image classification reasoning schemes: uncoded, 2-replication and MDS coding reasoning schemes. These reasoning schemes can protect the security of image data in the process of image reasoning and meet the weak security standard. Our system uses edge devices as computing devices, so it has the advantages of low computing cost and saving bandwidth. The experimental results show that our system can protect the security of image data, also has favorable stability and efficiency under the environment of heterogeneous edge computing.}

However, the security of SHS is also worth studying as user's information is collected from the devices and security-sensitive data are communicated through an open network. Therefore, how to guarantee the security of the data transmission in SHS is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a new secure data transmission scheme with access control to protect the data transmission in SHS. In our scheme, data transmission is secured by a new cryptographic primitive called access control encryption (ACE). Different from other existing solutions in SHS, our scheme controls not only which messages smart devices can receive, but also which messages they can send. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.}

	abstract = {Signal Processing in the Encrypted Domain (SPED) has received considerable attention as it aims at privacy-preserving solutions for various applications. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a popular signal transform widely used in signal processing. It has many applications in speech processing, still picture coding, image and video transformation, compression coding, and so on. In this paper, we mainly study how to implement DCT in the encryption domain with high precision. We propose a new scheme to implement encrypted domain DCT. This scheme encodes a complex number as a unit root polynomial in the evaluation, and realizes the high precision representation of complex numbers. With this representation, this scheme can also realize the high precision representation of decimals. To improve the computational efficiency, we also propose a fast implementation of DCT in the encryption domain, which can significantly improve the DCT speed for large-scale matrices. We conducted experiments to verify the effectiveness and efficiency. When the matrix size is small, our original method has the advantages of both high accuracy and fast speed. When the matrix size is large, the fast implementation outperforms the original method.}

	abstract = {The 5G network systems are evolving and have complex network infrastructures. There is a great deal of work in this area focused on meeting the stringent service requirements for the 5G networks. Within this context, security requirements play a critical role as 5G networks can support a range of services such as healthcare services, financial and critical infrastructures. 3GPP and ETSI have been developing security frameworks for 5G networks. Our work in 5G security has been focusing on the design of security architecture and mechanisms enabling dynamic establishment of secure and trusted end to end services as well as development of mechanisms to proactively detect and mitigate security attacks in virtualised network infrastructures. The focus of this paper is on the latter, namely the facilities and mechanisms, and the design of a security architecture providing facilities and mechanisms to detect and mitigate specific security attacks. We have developed and implemented a simplified version of the security architecture using Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) technologies. The specific security functions developed in this architecture can be directly integrated into the 5G core network facilities enhancing its security. We describe the design and implementation of the security architecture and demonstrate how it can efficiently mitigate specific types of attacks.}

	abstract = {Increasingly Industrial Control Systems (ICS) systems are being connected to the Internet to minimise the operational costs and provide additional flexibility. These control systems such as the ones used in power grids, manufacturing and utilities operate continually and have long lifespans measured in decades rather than years as in the case of IT systems. Such industrial control systems require uninterrupted and safe operation. However, they can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, as successful attacks on critical control infrastructures could have devastating consequences to the safety of human lives as well as a nation's security and prosperity. Furthermore, there can be a range of attacks that can target ICS and it is not easy to secure these systems against all known attacks let alone unknown ones. In this paper, we propose a software enabled security architecture using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) that can enhance the capability to secure industrial control systems. We have designed such an SDN/NFV enabled security architecture and developed a Control System Security Application (CSSA) in SDN Controller for enhancing security in ICS against certain specific attacks namely denial of service attacks, from unpatched vulnerable control system components and securing the communication flows from the legacy devices that do not support any security functionality. In this paper, we discuss the prototype implementation of the proposed architecture and the results obtained from our analysis.}

	abstract = {Secret Share (SS) is becoming a very hot topic within the scientific community. It allows us to split a secret into fragments and to share them among parties in such a way that a subset can recompose the original information. SS techniques assure a high redundancy degree, but the security level is fixed. Therefore, if a minimum number of peers collude then attackers can recompose the secret easily. A possible approach to improve the security of SS is designing nest fragment sharing techniques. In this paper, we propose the Nested Secret Share (NSS) as a more reliable and scalable strategy. In particular, we discuss the security of NSS considering the number of recomposition attempts that an attacker has to perform to retrieve the secret and then we deeply analyse the impact of the redundancy and the number of peers on the secret management against the percentage of compromised nodes. Experiments were promising and showed that the redundancy degree of SS can be highly improved by NSS.}

	abstract = {Attribute-Based Authentication (ABA) is becoming more prevalent in everyday interactions. In this paper, we propose the Decision-Making Method for Authentication (DMMA) to address the privacy concerns in ABA. The need for DMMA is supported through multiple observations. First, in practice, the indistinguishability of crypto-proof-based assertions (that are posessed by different users) fails with non-zero probability. This explains why cryptographic means alone are insufficient to provide a substantial level of unlinkability in ABA systems with n users. Second, each user in ABA possesses multiple credentials: they can be used interchangeably to get access to the service(s) which is provided by a relying party (RP). DMMA addresses the challenge of interchangeable usage. As an initial step, we synthesized the criterion of unlinkability: it is based on the definitions of international standard ISO 27551 as well as the information theoretic measure of conditional entropy. We then use that criterion to formalize the task of authentication as a non-cooperative coordination game. In this game, players (targets of the attack) maximize their utilities by using their assertions interchangeably. The experiment demonstrates that a number of equilibria with substantially higher unlinkability can be achieved. Unlinkability vary depending on: i) the information (and its trustworthiness) about the moves of the other players in the game; ii) the statistical distribution of user attributes. DMMA demonstrates how users may be provided recommendations over the optimal selection of assertions for ABA. These recommendations can have a practical impact if DMMA is implemented as a feature within Digital Credential Wallets (DCWs).}

In addition to the usual activities such as phone calls and text messages, users are increasingly turning to e-banking, e-commerce or healthcare. The Android operating system offers a number of mechanisms and good practices related to the creation of secure applications, but research shows that there are still many vulnerabilities. The paper contains an overview of the currently existing methods of securing data stored on the Android platform, threats related to the discussed system and a proposition for their elimination in the form of the Android Secure library, which facilitates the management of dangerous application rights, validation of data entered and provides an additional layer of security using one-time password or device location. The proposed solution eliminates only selected problems that the Android system has, but of course the best form of security is a qualified team creating the application and users' awareness of existing threats.}

For the sake of confidentiality of signals transmitted from source to destination, a robust artificial noise (AN)-aided beamforming scheme is proposed. Explicitly, our objective function is that of maximizing the worst-case secrecy rate under the transmit power constraints, by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix and AN at the source and the relay. To overcome the non-convexity of the robust AN-aided secure beamforming problem, we transform it into multi-block convex problems, where the semi-infinite linear matrix inequality is applied to eliminate the channel uncertainties. As a benefit, our proposed robust AN -aided secure beamforming scheme obtains substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The protection of people's safety is often achieved by relying on high-precision localization, and the demand for accurate indoor localization services has continued to grow. Especially, RFID localization has become a research hotspot for scholars. For the method of using the ranging model to realize RFID localization, when in an ideal radio frequency propagation environment, the observed RFID signal strength is directly related to the distance between the reader and the tag. Therefore, by using range information related to multiple reference tags, the reader can be clearly located in space. However, simply using the distance between the localization point and the reader obtained by the path propagation model to calculate the localization will produce a large localization error. In fact, the path propagation model reflects the general trend of signal propagation, and the corresponding model parameters need to be calculated based on the distance between the localization and the reader. For this reason, this paper proposes the localization using ranging in segment area based on fuzzy logic (RFL). The RFL method uses fuzzy logic to obtain the weights of localization belonging to different segments, and then constructs the propagation model of different segments and obtains the coordinates under this model. Finally, the segment weights calculate the final coordinates. The experiments show that RFL is superior to the maximum likelihood estimation and simple signal propagation model.}

To do so, we present a novel Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) approach, which combines white-box accountability, hidden policies and outsourced decryption. In contrast to existing schemes, the proposed construction is not only more flexible, but also efficient enough to be used in more resource-constrained environments. This is because our construction is designed around efficient Type III bilinear maps and relies on a dedicated proxy to perform computationally ex-pensive operations. Furthermore, we provide an implementation of the proposed design. The conducted evaluation demonstrates the practicality of the approach under realistic assumptions.}

	abstract = {Recently, edge computing (EC) has attracted wide attention as a novel and promising computing mode with high real-time and low-latency characteristics. However, users' privacy and the limited resources have become major concerns in the implementation of EC because edge devices are usually heterogeneous and untrustworthy. Although many related works have protected the user's privacy, they did not take the storage resource limitation of heterogeneous edge devices into consideration and their schemes may cause high communication load. In this paper, we propose PCHEC, a Private Coded computation scheme for Heterogeneous Edge Computing, to protect the user's privacy and minimize the communication load. Specifically, PCHEC first gives a storage allocation scheme to minimize the communication load in EC where the heterogeneous edge devices have different storage limits. Secondly, PCHEC utilizes linear coding to mix the target data with other information for the protection of the user's privacy. To evaluate the efficiency of PCHEC, we make theoretically analysis and conduct extensive simulations. The experiments show PCHEC effectively reduces the communication load by up to 70% compared with other schemes.}

	abstract = {With the development of 5G technology and intelligent terminals, the future direction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) evolution is Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC). In the pervasive edge computing environment, intelligent terminals can perform calculations and data processing. By migrating part of the original cloud computing model's calculations to intelligent terminals, the intelligent terminal can complete model training without uploading local data to a remote server. Pervasive edge computing solves the problem of data islands and is also successfully applied in scenarios such as vehicle interconnection and video surveillance. However, pervasive edge computing is facing great security problems. Suppose the remote server is honest but curious. In that case, it can still design algorithms for the intelligent terminal to execute and infer sensitive content such as their identity data and private pictures through the information returned by the intelligent terminal. In this paper, we research the problem of honest but curious remote servers infringing intelligent terminal privacy and propose a differential privacy collaborative deep learning algorithm in the pervasive edge computing environment. We use a Gaussian mechanism that meets the differential privacy guarantee to add noise on the first layer of the neural network to protect the data of the intelligent terminal and use analytical moments accountant technology to track the cumulative privacy loss. Experiments show that with the Gaussian mechanism, the training data of intelligent terminals can be protected reduction inaccuracy.}

	abstract = {In federated learning, machine learning and deep learning models are trained globally on distributed devices. The state-of-the-art privacy-preserving technique in the context of federated learning is user-level differential privacy. However, such a mechanism is vulnerable to some specific model poisoning attacks such as Sybil attacks. A malicious adversary could create multiple fake clients or collude compromised devices in Sybil attacks to mount direct model updates manipulation. Recent works on novel defense against model poisoning attacks are difficult to detect Sybil attacks when differential privacy is utilized, as it masks clients' model updates with perturbation. In this work, we implement the first Sybil attacks on differential privacy based federated learning architectures and show their impacts on model convergence. We randomly compromise some clients by manipulating different noise levels reflected by the local privacy budget ε of differential privacy with Laplace mechanism on the local model updates of these Sybil clients. As a result, the global model convergence rates decrease or even leads to divergence. We apply our attacks to two recent aggregation defense mechanisms, called Krum and Trimmed Mean. Our evaluation results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our attacks effectively slow down the convergence of the global models. We then propose a method to keep monitoring the average loss of all participants in each round for convergence anomaly detection and defend our Sybil attacks based on the training loss reported from randomly selected sets of clients as the judging panels. Our empirical study demonstrates that our defense effectively mitigates the impact of our Sybil attacks.}

With the development of cloud computing, database systems are able to upload large amounts of biometric data to cloud server for storage and identification to save local memory and improve computational efficiency. However, this involves potential privacy concerns because of the introduction of third-party platforms. In this paper, we achieve computational and communication efficiency in biometric identification, while preserving the privacy of data. Specifically, the database system firstly encrypts all biometric data and query data. Then, it sends the ciphertext to a cloud server to carry out matching tasks. Finally, the cloud server returns the index of final matches to the system so that it can check whether the biometric vector is legal or not. Detailed security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can resist powerful attacks. Beyond that, Experiments show that the scheme is more efficient in computation and communication than stat of art biometric identification schemes.}

	abstract = {Traditional implementations of differential privacy implicitly assume that users have homogeneous privacy requirement for all attributes of data. They provide a uniform level of privacy guarantee for all attributes by using a single privacy budget, \\varepsilon . However, this brings trouble to users in practice applications, where privacy requirements are often heterogeneous. In this case, users have to make a choice: either setting the privacy level high enough to satisfy even the privacy fundamentalists, which often results in poor model utility, or sacrificing the privacy of some attributes for practical model. Both are hard to be accepted by users. In this paper, we offer users what they probably want, an option that could provide a satisfactory privacy guarantee for important attributes with minimal utility loss. Our method, called heterogeneous differentially private ERM (HDP-ERM), allows the private learning algorithms to guarantee heterogeneous privacy for each attribute of training data. The noise injected in each parameter is adaptive according to its individual privacy budget, so that we can control the privacy-utility trade-off more finely. Experimental results show that our method is able to reach a satisfactory utility when only the important attributes need strong privacy guarantee, while the traditional DP-ERM would only get a useless model (one with low test accuracy) when providing the same level of privacy guarantee.}

	abstract = {With the development of location-based services (LBS), concerns on location privacy frequently arise. Location data often contains users' sensitive information, and direct release it may pose a threat to users' privacy. Differential privacy (DP), as a privacy preserving method with solid mathematical foundation, has been widely used in location data release. However, most if not all of the existing location DP mechanisms only consider static scenarios or perturb the location at single timestamp, which are vulnerable to the so-called location-dependent attacks (LDA) in continuous LBS queries. In this paper, an optimal location DP mechanism against LDA is proposed. Firstly, the necessary conditions for LDA defense are derived by combining the perturbation mechanism of location DP. Then the algorithm of safe perturbance region generation is established to dynamically calculate the perturbation range at each timestamp. Finally, we set up the optimization problem with the real-time quality loss as the optimization objective and the location DP and safe perturbance region as the optimization conditions, and realize the optimal DP mechanism for LDA by solving the optimization problem. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that our mechanism can effectively resist LDA, which also balance privacy protection and data utility well.}

	abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) brings a huge impact on current medical system in the detection and prevention of medical diseases, as well as the sharing and analysis of medical data. To efficiently collect medical data for disease prevention, the mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is employed. However, the exposure of sensitive information about users and crowdsensing tasks might cause serious privacy leakage in MCS. To solve this problem, in this paper, a Privacy-enhanced Mobile Crowdsensing strategy utilizing Blockchain technology, named PMCB, is proposed. Specifically, we propose to classify the users by spectral clustering based on the social network generated by the social attributes of users. In this way, both crowdsensing tasks and participating users are classified such that task receivers are restricted to receive specific crowdsensing tasks. Furthermore, the blockchain is used to store crowdsensing tasks and smart contract is used for access control. Experiment results show that PMCB can achieve efficient privacy protection in mobile crowdsensing with high system throughput and low transaction latency.}

	abstract = {Frequent subgraph mining has been one of the researches focuses in the field of data mining, which plays an important role in understanding social interaction mechanisms, urban planning, and studying the spread of diseases in social networks. Frequent subgraph mining provides a lot of valuable information. However, mining and publishing frequent subgraphs brings more and more risks of privacy leakage. In order to solve the problem of privacy leakage, the combination of frequent subgraph mining based on Apriori and differential privacy has become the mainstream method. Nevertheless, most of the existing research studies suffer from too large candidate subgraph sets, low accuracy, and low efficiency. Therefore, we propose a more secure and effective depth-first search algorithm for frequent subgraph mining under differential privacy, which is referred to as DP-gSpan. We design a heuristic truncation strategy and a new privacy budget allocation strategy to realize the reduction of the candidate set size and the rational allocation of the privacy budget. Through privacy analysis, we prove that DP-gSpan satisfies \\varepsilon -differential privacy. Experimental results over a large number of real-world datasets prove that the performance of the proposed mechanism is better.}

	abstract = {K-Nets is a deterministic clustering algorithm based on the network structure. It can automatically detect the sym-metric structure in the data and can be used to process clusters of different sizes, shapes or a specific number. However, K-Nets has the following shortcomings: (1) the clustering result is more sensitive to the manually input parameter K, so the accuracy will be affected; (2) the algorithm only considers the average distance of K-nearest neighbors, which may lead to some wrong distribution center points in the dataset with large density difference or the same score values during calculation; (3) it does not consider the privacy leakage during the clustering process. To solve the above problems, we propose a differential privacy protection method in adaptive K-Nets clustering, called ADP-K-Nets. Firstly, for reducing the influence of the parameters on the result, the natural eigenvalues are adaptively obtained through the characteristic of the natural neighbors and used as parameter values to find data points. Then we define a new method for calculating the score, which can solve the problem of incorrectly selecting cluster centers when there are large density differences or conflicts in the calculation process. Also, the Laplace noise is added in calculating the local density of every data point to protect data privacy. Experimental results show that our method ensures the performance of clustering compared with some existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Mobile Social Networks (MSN) have made it easy for us to communicate with our friends. Friend discovery is a common feature in the MSN application, which can recommend friends to requesters by comparing the similarity of attributes between users. However, in the process of attribute matching, users' personal information may be stolen by the server or other malicious users, leading to privacy leakage. Many solutions have been proposed for this problem, but the existing solutions have not considered the different ranges of user attribute values when calculating their similarity, leading to the final matching results not accurate. The existing solutions also do not consider users' location attributes and cannot find users according to the requester's query range. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained privacy-preserving profile matching scheme (FPPM) that supports precise queries. In our scheme, the requester can flexibly set the query range. We use order-preserving encryption to compare the cipher-text submitted by the user to precisely achieve similarity matching. To further protect users' privacy security, we design a secure dot product protocol (SDPP) that uses two servers to jointly compute the dot product of cipher-text vectors to avoid privacy leakage during the computation. Our proposed scheme supports the requester to define the querying range to obtain fine-grained query results. Based on it, we also consider multi-dimensional privacy protection such as user feature attributes and location attributes.}

	abstract = {Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) that enables a client to perform searches and updates on encrypted data has been intensively studied in cloud computing. Recently, forward privacy and backward privacy has engaged significant attention to protect DSSE from the leakage of updates. However, the research in this field almost focused on keyword-level updates. That is, the client needs to know the keywords of the documents in advance. In this paper, we proposed a document-level update scheme, DBP, which supports immediate deletion while guaranteeing forward privacy and backward privacy. Compared with existing forward and backward private DSSE schemes, our DBP scheme has the following merits: 1) Practicality. It achieves deletion based on document identifiers rather than document/keyword pairs; 2) Efficiency. It utilizes only lightweight primitives to realize backward privacy while supporting immediate deletion. Experimental evaluation on two real datasets demonstrates the practical efficiency of our scheme.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has been extensively applied in many fields, such as image segmentation, voice recognition, automatic language translation. However, many malicious attackers attempt to attack the model which was trained to accomplish a deep learning assignment via various schemes. Recently, differential privacy technology has been proposed to defend against such attacks via sacrificing the accuracy of model. Therefore, many optimization methods have been proposed to reduce the overall privacy cost, and aim to seek a tradeoff between privacy and utility. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the cluster technology to get a tighter clipping bound for differential privacy deep learning model. In addition, we quantify the clipping bound with an objective function of standard deviation and prove our scheme in an analytically way. A large number of experiments setting on real-datasets demonstrate that our adaptive clipping bound method is better than the previous method which sets the clipping bound constantly.}

	abstract = {Frequent itemset mining is a basic data mining task and has many applications in other data mining tasks. However, it is likely that the user's personal privacy information may be leaked in the mining process. In recent years, applying the local differential privacy protection model to mine all frequent itemsets is a relatively reliable and secure protection method. In local differential privacy, users first perturb the original data then send it to the aggregator, which prevents the aggregator leaking user's private information throughout the process. There are two major problems with data mining using local differential privacy, one is that the accuracy of the results is relatively low after mining, and the other is that the user transmits too much data to the server, which results in higher communication costs. In this paper, we use Hadamard response algorithm to improve the accuracy of the results while reduce the communication cost. Finally, we use FP-tree for frequent itemset mining to compare the Hadamard response with previous algorithms.}

To address the check-in privacy and recommendation result privacy leakage issues in existing location recommendation schemes, we first propose a location recommendation algorithm based on the similarity of user historical check-ins, and then we devise three location recommendation protocols on ciphertext to protect the privacy of user check-in data and recommendation results based on the homomorphic property of Paillier cryptosystem without assuming any trustworthy entity. These protocols calculate the ciphertexts of recommendation results at the location recommendation server(LSP) without learning any explicit check-in privacy of the user, and it also guarantees that the decryption server(DS) can only implement the decryption operations as requested by the user without being aware of any decrypted recommendation results, so that the privacy of user check-in data and recommendation results are both preserved solidly in our protocols. Although the above recommendation process is carried out without any user's explicit data, it is still effective enough to guarantee the accuracy of recommendation results. Finally, we prove the security, efficiency and accuracy of our scheme by extensive performance analysis.}

	abstract = {Cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) are advanced applications providing various services to enable a more secure, efficient, and accessible transportation system. When requesting services in C-ITS, privacy-preserving is crucial to avoid attempts in tracking vehicles who send continuous messages containing their authentication information. In this paper, we propose a revocable privacy-preserving authentication scheme through attribute-based credentials with complete subtree method. Differing from the existing anonymous credential works in C-ITS, our scheme supports the aggregation of attributes which facilitates the construction of a constant-size credential for multi-service. Not only maintaining the privacy-preserving of identity, the aggregate credential is also able to improve the efficiency of credential presentation. For illegal vehicles, our scheme revokes and disallows them to generate valid signatures via using complete subtree method in the non-revoked epoch. Moreover, we present analyses on aspects of security and performance, respectively. The former focuses on the security goals including privacy-preserving of identity, unlinkability, unforgeability, revocability and anti-replay attacks; while the latter shows that our scheme makes more practical sense for C-ITS.}

	abstract = {In the process of using smart contracts, users need to provide privacy data such as personal account information to the contract for transactions. However, as the number of users continues to increase, privacy data leakage has become more and more serious. Also, the current model checking methods do not involve verifying the privacy data in smart contracts. For these reasons, we introduce a privacy-preserving framework based on stochastic model checking called VeriPrivData. It formally expresses privacy data by data sensitivity. The smart contract is defined as the Commitments tuple with data sensitivity. Then the Commitments tuple is used to model as DTMC (Discrete Time Markov Chains). We extend PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic) to ds-PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic with data sensitivity) for describing the privacy requirements. Finally, we verify whether DTMC satisfies the ds-PCTL formula. In this paper, the VeriPrivData framework uses the stochastic model checking tool PRISM, and experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that this method can effectively avoid illegal disclosure of privacy data and enhance the protection of privacy data in the contract.}

	abstract = {Natural language processing can often require handling privacy-sensitive text. To avoid revealing confidential information, data owners and practitioners can use differential privacy, which provides a mathematically guaranteeable definition of privacy preservation. In this work, we explore the possibility of applying differential privacy to feature hashing. Feature hashing is a common technique for handling out-of-dictionary vocabulary, and for creating a lookup table to find feature weights in constant time. Traditionally, differential privacy involves adding noise to hide the true value of data points. We show that due to the finite nature of the output space when using feature hashing, a noiseless approach is also theoretically sound. This approach opens up the possibility of applying strong differential privacy protections to NLP models trained with feature hashing. Preliminary experiments show that even common words can be protected with (0.04,10 −5 )-differential privacy, with only a minor reduction in model utility.}

	abstract = {Outsourcing data services to the public cloud will help data owners save administrative costs, while it may bring privacy concerns. To guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive data against the untrusted cloud and unauthorized users, one way is to have the cloud perform the query processing with encrypted query requests over outsourced encrypted data. However, it is of great challenge to support various types of query processing, especially those of answering why-not questions, under data encryption settings without sensitive information leakage. In this paper, we define and solve the problem of answering why-not questions on top- k queries with privacy protection. To address the problem, we propose two Secure Why-Not top k Query (SWN k Q) processing approaches. In the basic approach, we adopt the Paillier cryptosystem to guarantee the semantic security of data and queries and propose two new secure protocols to support computations on ciphertext in SWN k Q processing. Then, we propose a secure weighing space generation method for obtaining the best approximate refined query. To solve the efficiency problem of the basic approach, we further propose an optimized approach, in which dominance-based secure data pruning and early stopping conditions are presented to improve the query efficiency by pruning searching space in the retrieval of refined queries. Thorough analysis shows the security and computational complexity of our approaches, and extensive experimental results on real datasets further demonstrate the query performance of our approaches.}

	abstract = {Line detection is an important research topic in image processing and computer vision. Hough transform is a widely used technique to detect lines. In the scenario of cloud computing, performing the Hough transform and line detection needs to consider privacy protection issues. In this paper, we propose implementing Hough transform in the encrypted domain and its application to line detection on encrypted images. Using the proposed encrypted domain Hough transform, we detect the extreme points in the encrypted parameter space. After transforming the extreme point into the encrypted spatial domain, we obtain the detected lines on the encrypted image. We conducted experiments and demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of our secure Hough transform and line detection on encrypted images.}

	abstract = {Biometric matching involves storing and processing sensitive user information. Maintaining the privacy of this data is thus a major challenge, and homomorphic encryption offers a possible solution. We propose a privacy-preserving biometrics-based authentication protocol based on fully homomorphic en-cryption, where the biometric sample for a user is gathered by a local device but matched against a biometric template by a remote server operating solely on encrypted data. The design ensures that 1) the user's sensitive biometric data remains private, and 2) the user and client device are securely authenticated to the server. A proof-of-concept implementation building on the TFHE library is also presented, which includes the underlying basic operations needed to execute the biometric matching. Performance results from the implementation show how complex it is to make FHE practical in this context, but it appears that, with implementation optimisations and improvements, the protocol could be used for real-world applications.}

	abstract = {Digital identities play a vital role in an increasingly digital world. These identities often rely on central authorities to issue and manage them. Central authorities have the drawback of being a central trusted party, representing a bottleneck and single point of failure with exclusive control of identity-related data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) tackles those problems by utilizing distributed ledger technology and making users the sovereign owners of their identity data. Nevertheless, SSI, as recent technology, still lacks qualified identity data. This is especially a problem since sensitive services like eGovernment or banking services require identity data issued by a qualified identity provider; thus, SSI - based identities cannot be used for these services. In this paper, we propose a concept for deriving identity data from an existing identity system into an SSI in a fully privacy-preserving way by additionally supporting offline verification. This way, we enable a chain of trust from the existing identity system to the SSI system by introducing a novel trust model. Our concept utilizes novel cryptographic primitives to support efficient and privacy-preserving identity showing as well as revo-cation. To underline the feasibility of our concept, we implement a proof system and benchmark the related use cases.}

	abstract = {Side-channel analysis (SCA) based on deep learning (DL) techniques have the benefit that they can disclose the secret key of protected block ciphers without preprocessing. But the size of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is so large that the training process is too time-consuming and the required number of traces for recovering secret key is too much. In this paper, we apply heatmap and SNR to reduce the number of parameters of our CNN architecture to 5,269,568 (i.e., one to tenth to the CNNbest). We also combine our CNN architecture with the multi-label classification and the transfer learning techniques to reduce the number of required traces. Consequently, two new CNN architectures are presented and validated on the public ASCAD dataset. The execution time of the training process approximates 15 minutes on average. The first CNN architecture can recover a key byte with only 30 synchronized traces. Combined with the transfer learning technique, the second CNN architecture requires 141 and 171 traces respectively in two different desynchronization cases. To our knowledge, for both synchronization and desynchronization cases, our analysis methods need the smallest amount of traces to extract a key byte.}

Due to remarkable profits, crackers favor DDoS as cybersecurity weapons to attack a victim. Even worse, edge servers are more vulnerable. Current solutions lack adequate consideration to the expense of attackers and inter-defender collaborations. Hence, we revisit the DDoS attack and defense, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of both parties. We further propose a joint defense framework to defeat attackers by incurring a significant increment of required bots and enlarging attack expenses. The quantitative evaluation and experimental assessment showcase that such expense can surge up to thousands of times. The skyrocket of expenses leads to heavy loss to the cracker, which prevents further attacks.}

Despite extensive attacking efforts which rely on white-box or gray-box access, how to perform attacks with black-box access continues to be elusive. Aspiring to fill this gap, we move one step further and present ML-Stealer that can steal the functionality of any type of ML models with mere black-box access. With two algorithm designs, namely, synthetic data generation and replica model construction, ML-Stealer can construct a deep neural network (DNN)-based replica model which has the similar prediction functionality to the victim ML model. ML-Stealer does not require any knowledge about the victim model, nor does it enforce the access to statistical information or samples of the victim's training data. Experiment results demonstrate that ML-Stealer can achieve the consistent prediction results with the victim model of an averaged testing accuracy of 85.6%, and up to 93.6% at best.}

	abstract = {Malware has become one of the biggest threats in the cyber world due to its ever-evolving nature. Machine learning-based methods rely on expertise in selecting handcrafted features which is time-consuming. Recent control flow graphs (CFGs) based method makes the best of graph neural network (GNN) on malware classification. But it ignores the semantic information inside CFGs and also relies on manually-designed features. To overcome these drawbacks, in this work, we introduce a malware classification model called MCBG that applies BERT and Graph Isomorphism Network with JumpingKnowledge (GIN-JK) to capture both semantic and structural features of CFGs. We conduct 5-fold cross-validation on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset to evaluate our model and it achieves an accuracy of 99.53%. The experimental results demonstrate that building semantic models on basic blocks is essential. Besides, MCBG outperforms the model which only considers CFG's structural information. Also, without using any manually-selected feature, it outperforms those of the state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted malware features.}

	abstract = {Malware is increasingly diversified and sophisti-cated. It is essential to rapidly and accurately detect malware activities when malware infection spreads. However, accurately distinguishing potential malware activities from countless indis-criminate scanning attacks is a huge challenge. In this study, we introduce Dark-NMF, a darknet analysis engine using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Dark-NMF focuses on synchronizing the spatiotemporal features seen when malware infection spreads and detects abnormally synchronous spatial features (source hosts and destination ports) automatically in near real-time. Dark-NMF measures the synchronization of spatial features by decomposing spatiotemporal patterns from darknet traffic using NMF. We tuned the hyperparameters of Dark- Nmfand evaluated the detection performance of malware activities against the performance of existing methods such as GLASSO and ChangeFinder using a human-labeled ground truth. We found that Dark-NMF detects all malware activities that should be detected in the ground truth without a miss. We also showed that Dark- Nmfhas many advantages over existing methods and provided a highly practical operation guideline. Consequently, Dark-NMF is expected to contribute as threat intelligence information for rapid response to malware activity.}

It is demonstrated that classical FA countermeasures, such as Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) and mask protection, are unable to thwart PFA. In this paper, we propose a fast-detection and fault-correction algorithm to prevent PFA. We construct a fixed input and output pair to detect faults rapidly. Then we build two extra redundant tables to store the relationship between the adjacent elements in the S-box, by which the algorithm can correct the faulty elements in the S-box. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively prevent PFA in both Single-Byte-Fault and Multiple-Bytes-Faults scenarios. Compared with the classical FA countermeasures, our algorithm has a much better effect against PFA. Further, the time cost of our algorithm is 40% lower than the classical FA countermeasures.}

	abstract = {Greybox fuzzing has been widely used in vulnerabilities detection. Most greybox fuzzing tools are coverage-based, which usually use basic block transition to gain code coverage and focus on improving it to trigger more bugs. However, only increasing code coverage is insufficient to find some heap-based vulnerabilities such as use-after-free (UAF) and double-free (DF). This is because, to trigger these vulnerabilities, one needs not only to cover more code, but also to execute special heap operations to satisfy a particular temporal constraint (i.e., allocating heap memory, free memory, and accessing the heap memory). In this paper, we propose an approach, namely MDFuzz, to detect heap-based vulnerabilities adopting multi-level directed greybox fuzzing. The key idea is identifying different targets to guide the fuzzing process to cover specific heap operations without wasting resources exploring unrelated program components. We first perform a static analysis to automatically recognize three critical targets related to heap operations and then calculate each basic block's distance to the targets. Moreover, we propose a probability-based multi-level seed queue and a novel seed selection strategy to augment the guidance of directed fuzzing. To evaluate MDFuzz, we have performed an evaluation on 7 real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MDFuzz significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers, including AFL, AFLFast and VUzzer, in terms of the time consumed to discover heap-based vulnerabilities. Moreover, MD-Fuzz found 4 previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world programs.}

Aiming at detecting the privacy leakage of DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS), in this paper, we proposed a model called DePL based on n-shot learning. This model can analyze which websites the user visits by classifying DoH traffic, and then we evaluate the impact of DoH protocol on user privacy leakage risk. In our experiments, we only used 15 training samples to obtain an accuracy of 86.54% in a closed environment. In an open environment, when the threshold is set to 0.7, the model still has an accuracy of 78.86%. Compared with the existing algorithms, DePL solves the problem of insufficient samples in real applications. A small number of training samples can obtain high-accuracy recognition, which proves the possibility of the detection of privacy leakage in DoH traffic.}

	abstract = {The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigm postulates global unique identities that are controlled by the user. To achieve a widespread applicability, the emphasized interoperability principle supports the proclaimed ambition. Furthermore, identity portability enables the transfer of the identity to another SSI solution. These axioms gain additional momentum due to the development of numerous implementations. In this paper, we examine interoperability and portability concepts for SSI. Initially, we define these principles regarding the blockchain-based SSI model. Subsequently, we outline assessment criteria considering functional scope, governance/ trust, scalability and further characteristics. For interoperability, we evaluate the concepts of protocol and standard, broker, hub and pairing. Besides that, we assess the transformer and auxiliary solutions for portability. We can conclude that all interoperability schemes provide the maximum functional level theoretically. In contrast, portability patterns are fragmented in this regard. Nonetheless, protocol and standards can only be applied in the design phase, whereas broker, hub, pairing, transformer and auxiliary solutions enable interoperability, respectively portability post-deployment of the SSI system.}

	abstract = {Open-source code repositories play an important role in software development, but they also introduce a slew of security issues. Firstly, everyone can use open-source projects and libraries from the third-party ecosystem, which increases the risk of vulnerabilities attacking. Secondly, it may cause a domino effect and make these products inherit these vulnerabilities when referring to vulnerable repositories. Traditional technical methods were unable to detect these public flaws in a timely manner, leaving these developers in an insecure situation. Although vulnerability management institutes like CVE and NVD provide inadequate coverage, leading to a lack of timely, reliable, and detailed information about open-source projects' vulnerabilities. To better detect and repair vulnerability, we designed a vulnerability intelligence mining system named DeepVuler based on threads analysis and changed code in open-source communities using machine learning. We choose and define a series of effective features extracted from open-source communities to early infer vulnerability intelligence. Our result shows that two proposed models of DeepVuler achieve a detection rate of 0.979 in threads and 0.890 in changed codes. Besides, the detection from DeepVuler is often days or weeks ahead of official vulnerability disclosure.}

	abstract = {Python has gradually become one of the most important programming languages through artificial intelligence's development. PIP, a package management tool for Python, offers one-click installation, allowing developers to utilize other people's code to speed up development. However, any registered member can easily upload packages to the repository that stores third-party packages. This functionality is used by attackers to poison the package index, i.e., to publish enormous malicious pip packages for installing backdoor, gathering information, etc. To know the situation of third-party packages in the Python community ecosystem, we establish the criteria for judging packages' suspicious or malicious behavior by analyzing the code logic in disclosed malicious packages. With the gained findings, we propose and implement Pip Poisoning Detector (PPD), an approach based on anomaly detection. PPD evaluated 228,723 packages, and after human inspection, we found 63 malicious and 238 suspicious ones among the output 5,699 results. The experimental results prove that our approach is effective and can significantly reduce review workload by 97.51%.}

	abstract = {Text-based CAPTCHAs are still the most widely used CAPTCHA mode. Many researchers have proposed attack methods to break them. In previous attacks, segmentation-based methods require at least three steps: preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition, which means that different modes of CAPTCHA require various preprocessing and segmentation algorithms. In recent years, a series of deep learning (DL) models have been designed for cracking text-based CAPTCHAs. However, these methods require annotating numerous images, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised DL-based solver for breaking text-based CAPTCHAs, which can use a small number of labeled CAPTCHAs to achieve a high-performance attack model. The CNN module and the attention-based Seq2Seq module are two key components for effective feature extraction and character recognition. The experimental results show that our solver successfully attacked 9 types of most popular text-based CAPTCHAs, and the attack success rate is better than the four latest attack models. In addition, our model does not perform any data preprocessing and has a fast attack speed, making it more suitable for real-time attacks. The code and dataset are available on the github.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely deployed in various applications. However, many researches indicated that DNN is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The attacker can create a hidden backdoor in target DNN model, and trigger the malicious behaviors by submitting specific backdoor instance. However, almost all the existing backdoor works focused on the digital domain, while few studies investigate the backdoor attacks in real physical world. Restricted to a variety of physical constraints, the performance of backdoor attacks in the real physical world will be severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a robust physical backdoor attack method, PTB (physical transformations for backdoors), to implement the backdoor attacks against deep learning models in the real physical world. Specifically, in the training phase, we perform a series of physical transformations on these injected backdoor instances at each round of model training, so as to simulate various transformations that a backdoor may experience in real world, thus improves its physical robustness. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art face recognition model show that, compared with the backdoor methods that without PTB, the proposed attack method can significantly improve the performance of backdoor attacks in real physical world. Under various complex physical conditions, by injecting only a very small ratio (0.5 %) of backdoor instances, the attack success rate of physical backdoor attacks with the PTB method on VGGFace is 82%, while the attack success rate of backdoor attacks without the proposed PTB method is lower than 11%. Meanwhile, the normal performance of the target DNN model has not been affected.}

	abstract = {Malware is becoming the main threat during the development of the Internet. Driven by the increasing cost due to the complexity and diversity of malware, machine learning is more and more popular for related tasks. Among these ML methods, convolutional neural network has gradually become the mainstream for its excellent performance. At the same time, the scale of labeled data needed for training a ConvNet is so large that labeling malware samples has become a huge burden which hinders the practical application. Meanwhile, better performance means deeper network which requires more resources and more labeled samples for training. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework called MALUP for malware classification of guaranteed performance improvement which uses ConvNet with deep unsupervised pre-training. The framework is implemented with deepCluster as the pre-training method to deal with unlabeled malware images and the pre-trained ConvNet is then fine-tuned with labeled samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALUP by measuring the performance on a benchmark provided by Microsoft in different conditions. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MALUP compared to the ConvNet of the same architecture, especially for a shallower network. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of the number of clusters, the volume of unlabeled data, a simple balance restriction optimization during pre-training, and the percentage of labeled samples as well. Those variables form the optimization space of MALUP and help the proposed framework outperform the transfer learning model pre-trained with ImageNet in deepCluster.}

	abstract = {Recently, DDoS attack has developed rapidly and become one of the most important threats to the Internet. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods can-not train a satisfactory model based on the data of a single client. Moreover, in the real scenes, there are a large number of devices used for traffic collection, these devices often do not want to share data between each other depending on the research and analysis value of the attack traffic, which limits the accuracy of the model. Therefore, to solve these problems, we design a DDoS attack detection model based on federated learning named FLDDoS, so that the local model can learn the data of each client without sharing the data. In addition, considering that the distribution of attack detection datasets is extremely imbalanced and the proportion of attack samples is very small, we propose a hierarchical aggregation algorithm based on K-Means and a data resampling method based on SMOTEENN. The result shows that our model improves the accuracy by 4% compared with the traditional method, and reduces the number of communication rounds by 40%.}

	abstract = {Logs, prevalent among nearly all computer systems, contain rich information that helps with troubleshooting or root cause analysis. Therefore, logs are excellent information sources for anomaly detection. Since logs are diverse and heterogeneous, to deal with all of them requires maintenance personnel to check detection results one by one, which is troublesome. This paper applies an ensemble method that combines the output of different results of log anomaly detection and generates a unified output to reduce the burden of maintenance personnel. Since logs are recorded according to user behavior, they often have non-fixed intervals. We apply a trust computational model to transform the unevenly distributed data into a regularly spaced time series. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to employ the trust in the data processing. Futhermore, there are some parameters introduced by the trust computational model. We take advantage of the parametric ensemble technique to address the issue of parameter choice and finally improve the accuracy of anomaly detection. In this way, our method allows one to track a user from multi-view by logs with ease. The experiment shows that our method could achieve a good performance in detecting anomalies of user behavior from multiple kinds of logs.}

	abstract = {Android platform is facing serious malware threats due to its popularity, as evidenced by the drastic increase on the number of mobile malware families and variants in recent years. Detecting malware variants and zero-day malware is a critical challenge that must be addressed to protect mobile devices against malware attacks. In this study, we present AndroCreme, a novel network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that can identify unseen malware by analyzing the network behavior of Android malware. To address the temporal bias issue in NIDS, we propose a method for rapid iterative update of the model based on data selection and data size limitation. The selection of effective data is carried out by induction and conformal technology, and the data scale is controlled by the method of time window and data cycle selection. To further achieve fast training speed and high efficiency, we leverage a gradient boosting framework that uses a tree-based learning algorithm, namely, LightGBM, as the meta predictor. We evaluate the performance of AndroCreme over 400K real-world network flows, which are collected from over 30K Android benignware and 21K malware applications. The experimental results show that, compared with the retraining method using all data, AndroCreme requires only a small amount of datareduce more than 3x to obtain better detection performance, which effectively solves the temporal bias.}

	abstract = {Machine learning has been increasingly adopted to detect Android malwares. Most existing studies depend on features in code space such as information flows and API calls. Malware variants would engage these models in a never-ending war. Inspired by the observation that some variants share similar or even identical user interfaces (UIs), this paper explores employing visible UI screenshot as the indicator to build a novel Android malware detection method. To achieve this vision, we built the first Android Application Screenshot Dataset (AnASD) consisting of more than twenty thousand UI screenshots produced by both benign applications and malwares. A thorough analysis was conducted to characterize the dataset, especially the UI difference between benign applications and malwares. Then a set of state of the art deep learning classifiers on AnASD were trained and evaluated. The results of both sim-ilarity measurement and classification performance proved the feasibility to detect Android malwares based on user interfaces. To facilitate the research community, the dataset is free available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14445768.}

	abstract = {Sandbox is an excellent tool for dynamic malware analysis. However, the sandbox detection techniques are increasingly adopted to develop malwares, which has been a significant threat to sandbox analysis. These malwares can detect the running environment and show different behaviors in corresponding environments. So far, there have been several studies about countermeasures, but most of them concentrate on Windows OS. Environmental features in Linux sandbox have not been summarized yet. Besides, existing popular sandboxes can hardly combat against sandbox detecting techniques. In this paper, we focus on Linux sandbox. We firstly propose Linux environmental features from six aspects and implement an effective tool to collect features from running environment to tell the discrepancy among physical machine, virtual machine and sandbox. More importantly, we present EnvFaker, an effective method to reinforce Linux sandbox against environmental-sensitive malware. This method uses tracer to track child process and injected process, filters to intercept sandbox detecting behaviors, and emulator to disguise wear-and-tear and network environment. The experimental results further demonstrate that our method is effective against detecting techniques for Linux sandbox.}

	abstract = {The Low-Rate Denial of Service (LDoS) attack is a new type of Denial of Service attack. Because of its adequate concealment, it is not easy to detect by conventional detection methods. The detection method using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is feasible, but it has the defect of insufficient generalization ability; consequently, this paper proposes the LDoS attack detection method based on the Two-step Self-adjusting Support Vector Machine (TS-SVM). For the network traffic data, the Discrete Wavelet Transform is used as the feature extraction tool to decompose and reconstruct the network traffic, and the time-domain features such as the mean value of the traffic subband are selected for detection. Two kinds of SVM approaches of self-adjusting are put forward in this paper: to adjust the increasing degree of data dimension, and the other is to adjust the error tolerance. Next, the Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm is used to realize the two adjustment approaches, ultimately achieving the goal of ascension generalization ability. The detection model constructed has a higher detection effect. To verify the method's feasibility, experiments are carried out in a Software Defined Network (SDN) created by the Mininet simulator and Ryu controller. By comparing the proposed method with the traditional SVM method, it is shown that the performance of this method is better than that of the method based on the traditional SVM. By comparing with the traditional LDoS detection methods, it is manifested that the detection accuracy of this method is 92.36%-96.65%, which is higher than the traditional detection methods.}

	abstract = {SSL library plays an important role in ensuring secure connections against remote attacks, and thus the correct usages of SSL library should be guaranteed to avoid security and reliability flaws. However, improper error handling of API function failures frequently happens in SSL library usages, which could introduce security vulnerabilities. To detect such bugs in SSL usages, existing tools need correct error handling specifications. Manually write specifications is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, a few works towards automatic inferring specifications are presented. However, the principles used in such works are insufficient for SSL library. Thus, in this paper, we first conduct an empirical study of error handling bugs in SSL applications to understand the true nature of such bugs, and the properties of these bugs are summarized, including the frequently used code structure for handling errors, the commonly occurred error-indicating features of the handling actions, and the general bug categories. Based on these properties, we design and implement a tool that can automatically infer error handling specifications and detect error handling bugs by exploiting the specifications in SSL applications. We evaluated our tool on 9 real-world open-source SSL applications. The tool infers 424 specifications in total, out of which 383 are confirmed correct, with a precision of 90%. Moreover, 27 real-world bugs have been detected, and all of them are confirmed by developers.}

	abstract = {APT, known as Advanced Persistent Threat, is a difficult challenge for cyber defence. These threats make many traditional defences ineffective as the vulnerabilities exploited by these threats are insiders who have access to and are within the network. This paper proposes DeepTaskAPT, a heterogeneous task-tree based deep learning method to construct a baseline model based on sequences of tasks using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that can be applied across different users to identify anomalous behaviour. Rather than applying the model to sequential log entries directly, as most current approaches do, DeepTaskAPT applies a process tree based task generation method to generate sequential log entries for the deep learning model. To assess the performance of DeepTaskAPT, we use a recently released synthetic dataset, DARPA Operationally Transparent Computing (OpTC) dataset and a real-world dataset, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) dataset. Both of them are composed of host-based data collected from sensors. Our results show that DeepTaskAPT outperforms similar approaches e.g. DeepLog and the DeepTaskAPT baseline model demonstrate its capability to detect malicious traces in various attack scenarios while having high accuracy and low false-positive rates. To the best of knowledge this is the very first attempt of using recently introduced OpTC dataset for cyber threat detection.}

	abstract = {Development platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, have become very popular among software developers. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for developers to inadvertently leak secrets (e.g. API keys, credentials) and confidential source code on public Git repositories, facilitating numerous security breaches that impact reputation and result in losing revenue. Current Git leak detection strategies and tools often fall short due to a high false-positive rate, an ever-growing number of platforms and repositories to inspect, and a limited reach. This paper investigates the shortcomings of traditional Git leak detection methodologies and introduces an alternative approach to overcome those shortcomings. The approach consists of identifying all Git repositories associated with an organisation by collecting the URLs and the respective maintainer names from its endpoint fleet, empowering blue-teams to prioritise content inspection efforts against a well-defined set of targets and to boost incident response capabilities. The paper describes a prototype we implemented that serves as a proof of concept for the approach.}

However, the forensic examination of IoT ecosystems introduces a number of investigative problems for the digital forensics community. One of these problems is the limited availability of practical processes and techniques to guide the preservation and analysis of residual data from these ecosystems. Focusing on a detailed case study of the iHealth Smart Scale ecosystem, we present an empirical demonstration of practical techniques to recover residual data from different evidence sources within a smart scale ecosystem. We also document the artifacts that can be recovered from a smart scale ecosystem, which could inform a digital (forensic) investigation.

	abstract = {Insider threats are the cyber attacks from the trusted entities within an organization. An insider attack is hard to detect as it may not leave a footprint and potentially cause huge damage to organizations. Anomaly detection is the most common approach for insider threat detection. Lack of real-world data and the skewed class distribution in the datasets makes insider threat analysis an understudied research area. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to enrich under-represented minority class samples to provide meaningful and diverse data for anomaly detection from the original malicious scenarios. Comprehensive experiments performed on benchmark dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of using CGAN augmented data, and the capability of multi-class anomaly detection for insider activity analysis. Moreover, the method is compared with other existing methods against different parameters and performance metrics.}

	abstract = {With the continuous improvement of attack methods, there are more and more distributed, complex, targeted attacks in which the attackers use combined attack methods to achieve the purpose. Advanced cyber attacks include multiple stages to achieve the ultimate goal. Traditional intrusion detection systems such as endpoint security management tools, firewalls, and other monitoring tools generate a large number of alerts during the attack. These alerts include attack clues, as well as many false positives unrelated to attacks. Security analysts need to analyze a large number of alerts and find useful clues from them and reconstruct attack scenarios. However, most traditional security monitoring tools cannot correlate alerts from different sources, so many multi-step attacks are still completely unnoticed, requiring manual analysis by security analysts like finding a needle in a haystack. We propose MAAC, a multi-step attack alert correlation system, which reduces repeated alerts and combines multi-step attack paths based on alert semantics and attack stages. The evaluation results of the real-world datasets show that MAAC can effectively reduce the alerts by 90% and find attack paths from a large number of alerts.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of communication net-work, the types and quantities of network traffic data have in-creased substantially. What followed was the frequent occurrence of versatile cyber attacks. As an important part of network security, the network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) can monitor and protect the network equippments and terminals in real time. The traditional detection methods based on deep learning (DL) are always in supervised manners in NIDS, which can automatically build end-to-end detection model without man-ual feature extraction and selection by domain experts. However, supervised learning methods require large-scale labeled data, yet capturing large labeled datasets is a very cubersome, tedious and time-consuming manual task. Instead, unsupervised learning is an effective way to overcome this problem. Nonetheless, the ex-isting unsupervised methods are prone to low detection efficiency and are difficult to train. In this paper we propose a novel NIDS method called PGAN based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to detect the abnormal traffic from the perspective of Anomaly Detection, which leverage the competitive speciality of adversarial training to learn the normal traffic. Based on the public dataset CICIDS2017, three experimental results show that PGAN can significantly outperform other unsupervised methods like stacked autoencoder (SAE) and isolation forest (IF).}

	abstract = {With the rapid information explosion on online social network sites (SNSs), it becomes difficult for users to seek new friends or broaden their social networks in an efficient way. Link prediction, which can effectively conquer this problem, has thus attracted wide attention. Previous methods on link prediction fail to comprehensively capture the factors leading to new link formation: 1) few models have considered the varied impacts of users' short-term and long-term interests on link prediction. Besides, they fail to jointly model the influence from social influence and “weak links”; 2) considering that different factors should be derived from information sources of different modalities, there is a lack of effective multi-modal framework for link prediction. In this view, we propose a novel multi-modal framework for link prediction (referred as LP-UIT) which fuses a comprehensive set of features (i.e., user information and topological features) extracted from multi-modal information (i.e., textual information, graph information, and numerical information). Specifically, we adopt graph convolutional network to process the network information to capture topological features, employ natural language processing techniques (i.e., TF-IDF and word2Vec) to model users' short-term and long-term interests, and identify social influence and “weak links” from numerical features. We further use an attention mechanism to model the relationship between textual and topological features. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is designed to combine the representations from three modalities for link prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of LP-UIT over the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Credit card fraudulent activities cause huge financial losses around the world every year. In recent years, data-driven methods are increasingly becoming fraud detection methods for financial institutions. Some related studies based on machine learning and data mining have been proposed. However, most of them do not consider the actual financial losses associated with the fraud detection process. Or some related cost sensitive methods focus on minimizing cost loss but the accuracy of detection is low. This paper presents a cost-sensitive heterogeneous integration model, CSHIM, for credit card fraud detection. CSHIM considers the different misclassification costs of each transaction and integrates the superior performance of different individual classifiers through the cost-sensitive weighted Dempster-Shafer fusion theory to achieve better fraud detection results. The goal is to achieve good performance not only in reducing monetary losses but also improving detection accuracy. We have done experiments on public data sets, the experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can save up to 74.69% of the cost, which not only can achieve good results in cost savings, but also has better performance of other standard metrics compared with other methods.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of population, the life pressure, and the various intensive pressures every day deepen the competition among people more intensive. Tens of millions of people have been suffering from depression every year and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. The development of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and QQ provides more convenient communication and provides a new emotional release window. People communicate with their friends and share their opinions to express their feelings. It provides an opportunity to detect depression in social networks. Although using social networks to detect depression has picked an established position on a global scale, few researchers consider the data security and privacy-preserving schemes. Therefore, we propose the federated learning technique as an efficient and scalable method. With the larger number of social networks data from diverse edge devices, federated learning can process a large number of edge devices in parallel. For the study, we aim to analyze depression on Weibo collected from an online social network. We propose a novel algorithm Text-CNN Asynchronous Federated optimization (CAFed) based on federated learning to improve the communication cost and convergence rate. We have shown our proposed method can effectively protect users' privacy under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of prediction. We prove that our proposed method's convergence rate is faster than the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) for non-convex problems. Federated learning techniques identify high-quality solutions to mental health issues among Weibo users.}

	abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack is a side channel attack against encrypted tunnels which infers network activities of encrypted tunnels users. WF attack has been successfully applied to the Tor network, which poses a huge threat to the privacy of Tor visitors. A lot of countermeasures are therefore proposed to defend against such attacks. However, the newest attack successfully undermined the existing defense leveraging deep learning technique. In this paper, we propose an defense named Attack to Attack (A2A) that leverages adversarial example to attack the attacker's classifier. A2A treats website fingerprinting model as a black box. In order to find effective adversarial examples for the attacker's model, A2A manipulates traffic iteratively according to the output of a substitute model which is an elaborate model intentionally learning a similar classification boundary with the attacker's model. We evaluate the effectiveness of A2A on a public tor traffic dataset and the newest WF attack. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides effective defense with a bandwidth overhead of 2.2%, which significantly outperforms the manually designed defense (typically has a bandwidth overhead of 31%).}

	abstract = {The automatic detection of vulnerabilities in Web applications using taint analysis is a hot topic. However, existing taint analysis methods for sanitizers identification are too simple to find available taint transmission chains effectively. These methods generally use pre-constructed dictionaries or simple keywords to identify, which usually suffer from large false positives and false negatives. No doubt, it will have a greater impact on the final result of the taint analysis. To solve that, we summarise and classify the commonly used sanitizers in Web applications and propose an identification method based on semantic analysis. Our method can accurately and completely identify the sanitizers in the target Web applications through static analysis. Specifically, we analyse the natural semantics and program semantics of existing sanitizers, use semantic analysis to find more in Web applications. Besides, we implemented the method prototype in PHP and achieved a vulnerability detection tool called VulChecker. Then, we experimented with some popular open-source CMS frameworks. The results show that Vulchecker can accurately identify more sanitizers. In terms of vulnerability detection, VulChecker also has a lower false positive rate and a higher detection rate than existing methods. Finally, we used VulChecker to analyse the latest PHP applications. We identified several new suspicious taint data propagation chains. Before the paper was completed, we have identified four unreported vulnerabilities. In general, these results show that our approach is highly effective in improving vulnerability detection based on taint analysis.}

	abstract = {DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), as a rising star to improve DNS security and privacy, has developed rapidly in recent years. It mixes with HTTP features, shares ports with other web services and provides API with URI templates. The unique characteristics of DoH, as well as its fast growth, bring both promising prospects and new risks, e.g. botnet communication, name abuse and data exfiltration. It is essential for network operators to learn about adoption and usage of DoH resolvers. Active scanning may be a possible way. However, it is considered to incur significantly additional overhead, which can be inefficient and aggressive. In this paper, we present DOHUNTER, a system for automati-cally discovering DoH resolvers. DOHUNTER: (i) picks DoH flow from miscellaneous HTTPS traffic, (ii)confirms DoH resolvers based on the detected DoH flow, (iii)mines other related DoH resolvers from the known ones. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DOHUNTER in detecting DoH flow and finding DoH resolvers. Utilizing DOHUNTER, we witness an alarming increase in DoH adoption. Additionally, we also reveal oblivious growing trends of DoH, which may provide advice for both users and network operators.}

	abstract = {In recent years, various deep learning techniques have been exploited in side channel attacks, with the anticipation of obtaining more satisfactory attack results. Most of them con-centrate on improving network architectures or putting forward novel metrics, assuming that there are adequate profiling traces available to train an appropriate neural network. However, in practical scenarios, profiling traces are probably insufficient, which makes the network learn deficiently and compromises attack performance. In this paper, we investigate a kind of data augmentation technique, called mixup, and first propose to exploit it in deep-learning based side channel attacks, for the purpose of expanding the profiling set and facilitating the chances of mounting a successful attack. We utilize mixup to generate new traces and perform Correlation Power Analysis for generated traces and original traces. The analysis reveals that the leakage location and leakage intensity between them are consistent. In view of this observation, we consider it feasible to add generated traces to the original profiling set. Our verifying experiments show that mixup is truly capable of enhancing attack performance especially for insufficient profiling traces. Specifically, when the size of the training set is decreased to 30% of the whole set, mixup can almost reduce required attacking traces to half. We test three mixup parameter values and conclude that generally all of them can bring about improvements. Besides, we compare three leakage models and surprisingly discover that least significant bit model, which is less frequently used in previous works, actually surpasses prevalent identity model and hamming weight model in terms of attack results.}

	abstract = {Android application markets face severe threats of malware attacks. Existing learning-based malware detection approaches rely on easily obfuscated features or unscalable sophisticated graph analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose DroidRadar, an accurate Android malware detection system based on lightweight graph embedding. The key insight of our method is constructing an entire Android application collection as a global graph schema and using sensitive APIs as bridge nodes to propagate inter-application information. We conduct statistical correlation analysis from different perspectives to model the application's usage pattern of sensitive APIs, then apply graph convolution network (GCN) to perform node embedding and malware detection. We evaluate DroidRadar on large scale datasets spanning nine years. Results show that DroidRadar has an average detection accuracy of 98.57% and a false-positive rate of 1.4 % on different time periods, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, and it has strong robustness when detecting obfuscated malware variants.}

	abstract = {Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) enforces a control-flow graph (CFG) to limit attackers' ability to manipulate runtime control flow. CFI variations, enforcing different CFGs, achieve different degrees of attack surface reduction. To compare the security strength of different CFI policies, measuring the remaining attack surface is critical but challenging. Therefore, we propose MazeRunner, a framework that quantitatively estimates the attack surface of a CFI-hardened program. Methodology-wise, it takes a program's CFG, an attack model, and a security-violation policy as input to discover risky program points by an attack-aware data dependency tracking algorithm. Risky program points and the CFG are used to compute a metric for the remaining attack surface. We evaluate MazeRunner with 3 CFG types, 3 attack models, and 4 security-violation policies against 13 realistic benchmarks, and demonstrate that the new metric achieves higher precision than traditional metrics while maintaining completeness.}

	abstract = {The world has witnessed the proliferation of mobile technologies as well as smartphone-related cybercrimes in recent years. However, due to high mobility of smartphones and tablets and transient nature of those attacks, previous forensic approaches become inadequate to retrieve forensic data and respond to cybersecurity incidents in time, especially when the investigation involves a large number of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose ReLF 1 1 Source code available at https://github.com/nexus-lab?q=relf, a remote live forensics system for Android smartphones and tablets. ReLF enables forensic investigators to effectively triage operating Android devices and acquire a wide range of forensic artifacts at scale. Compared to existing Android forensic tools that are publicly available, ReLF provides a much more comprehensive set of collectible artifacts and better OS compatibility. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the ReLF client only introduces minor energy overhead to Android devices and that the ReLF server can well handle a large number of Android devices with increasing workload. We also showcase how ReLF can be used in real-world forensic investigation through case studies.}

	abstract = {As an important information fusion method in video surveillance forensics, infrared and visible image fusion has received extensive attention and research. In order to reduce the sampling number of the original video surveillance image information in the fusion process, improve the processing efficiency and the background quality of the fused image, a frequency domain fusion algorithm of infrared and visible image based on compressed sensing for video surveillance forensics is proposed. Firstly, the compressed sensing is used for sampling, and then the subspace pursuit (SP) algorithm is applied to reconstruct the sparse coefficient. Secondly, the sparse coefficient is transformed in frequency domain, and the fusion is completed in frequency domain, and finally obtains the fused image. A large number of experiments show when the number of compressed sensing samples is 70%, the fusion quality is better than the other four comparison algorithms that take advantage of full sampling. Compared with similar algorithms, this algorithm has obvious advantages in the presentation of image background information and gradient structure information.}

	abstract = {Web applications are popular victims of injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Vulnerability detection tools allow preventing these attacks but are often bound to a single language and hard to port to new languages. We propose a new approach to support the addition of new languages without much effort. In order to achieve this, our solution does not analyze the source code AST directly, instead, it traverses the source code AST and builds a generic AST (GAST) from it. Then, the tool analyzes the GAST to find vulnerabilities. This way we decouple the analysis and the source code parsing. To add support for a new language we just need to generate a parser and write a converter for that AST, which is usually less than 110 lines of code. We implemented a tool called GT with this approach. The tool currently supports four languages: Java, PHP, Python and JavaScript. It was tested against several web applications written in the same languages.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet and mobile communication technologies, the social media has been spreading into all aspects of people's life, work and study. People can not only communicate with each other and share news through social media platforms, but also check news and information and learn about popular topics. However, due to the social platform's characteristics, such as rapid information dissemination and interaction mechanism among users, it has also become the main attacking surface for adversaries. Spammers mainly use social media platforms to spread phishing, fraud, publish pornography, malicious content and links to make profits, which seriously disrupts the normal operation of social media platforms and causes adverse effects on society. In this paper, we combine the semi-supervised model with maximum contrastive pessimistic likelihood (MCPL) estimation and the ensemble learning CatBoost algorithm, proposing a semi-supervised ensemble learning classification algorithm model (SSML-CatBoost) for spammer detection in social media, and comparative experimental results show that our model outperforms other models for different amounts of labeled data and different numbers of iterations.}

We then explore the feature combinations of abnormal behaviors and extract extra features from original data in preprocessing steps.

A reputation system collects history ratings from users about an object/entity and aggregates them as a reputation score, for the reference of future potential users. The reputation score can accurately reflect the real quality of this object if all the ratings are fairly provided, otherwise it may mislead other users if the ratings are unfairly provided. In order to mitigate the impacts of unfair ratings, many unfair rating detection models have been studied in the recent years, through identifying and filtering out the unfair ratings. In this work, we aim to investigate the existing unfair rating detection models considering realistic application settings in an interactive approach where the process of the unfair ratings detection is conducted by involving the interactions between the application system designer and these models. Based on this idea, we design a customized interactive system (CIS) which can satisfy the customized demands of application system designers through five customized functions, i.e., customized scenes, customized attack, customized model, customized metrics, and customized result presentations. After a series of interactions, application system designers can obtain the detection model that best fulfills their demands and the corresponding optimal parameters. To present the applicability of the proposed CIS system, we analyze several typical reputation models in our experiments and the experimental results indicate that our work can effectively bridge the existing unfair rating detection models with realistic applications.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Deep Learning-as-a-Service can be de-ployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide smart services and sensor data processing. However, recent research has re-vealed that some Deep Neural Networks (DNN) can be easily misled by adding relatively small but adversarial perturbations to the input (e.g., pixel mutation in input images). One challenge in defending DNN against these attacks is to efficiently identify and filtering out the adversarial pixels. The state-of-the-art defense strategies with good robustness often require additional model training for specific attacks. To reduce the computational cost without loss of generality, we present a defense strategy called a progressive defense against adversarial attacks (PDAAA) for efficiently and effectively filtering out the adversarial pixel mutations, which could mislead the neural network towards erro-neous outputs, without a-priori knowledge about the attack type. We evaluated our progressive defense strategy against various attack methods on two well-known datasets. Experimental result shows it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods(Adversarial-PGD, Adversarial-Network, and Adversarial-Dual-Network) with dramatically reduced computation cost.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has displayed tremendous growth in recent years, resulting in innovations like Industry 4.0 and smart environments that provide improvements to efficiency, management of assets and facilitate intelligent decision making. However, these benefits are offset by considerable cybersecurity concerns that arise due to inherent vulnerabilities, which hinder IoT-based systems' Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Security vulnerabilities can be detected through the application of penetration testing, and specifically, a subset of the information-gathering stage, known as vulnerability identification. Yet, existing penetration testing solutions can not discover zero-day vulnerabilities from IoT environments, due to the diversity of generated data, hardware constraints, and environmental complexity. Thus, it is imperative to develop effective penetration testing solutions for the detection of vulnerabilities in smart IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based penetration testing framework, namely Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network-Enabled Vulnerability Identification (LSTM-EVI). We utilize this framework through a novel cybersecurity-oriented testbed, which is a smart airport-based testbed comprised of both physical and virtual elements. The framework was evaluated using this testbed and on real-time data sources. Our results revealed that the proposed framework achieves about 99% detection accuracy for scanning attacks, outperforming other four peer techniques.}

	abstract = {With recent advances in autonomous driving, voice control systems have become increasingly adopted as human-vehicle interaction methods. This technology enables drivers to use voice commands to control the vehicle and will be soon available in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Prior work has shown that Siri, Alexa and Cortana, are highly vulnerable to inaudible command attacks. This could be extended to ADAS in real-world applications and such an inaudible command threat is difficult to detect due to microphone nonlinearities. In this paper, we aim to develop a more practical solution by using camera views to defend against inaudible command attacks where ADAS are capable of detecting their environment via multi-sensors. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning classification system to defend against inaudible command attacks. Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed defense methods and the best classification accuracy reaches 89.2%.

	abstract = {At present, in the face of the huge and complex data in cloud computing, the parallel computing ability of quantum computing is particularly important. Quantum principal component analysis algorithm is used as a method of quantum state tomography. We perform feature extraction on the eigenvalue matrix of the density matrix after feature decomposition to achieve dimensionality reduction, proposed quantum principal component extraction algorithm (QPCE). Compared with the classic algorithm, this algorithm achieves an exponential speedup under certain conditions. The specific realization of the quantum circuit is given. And considering the limited computing power of the client, we propose a quantum homomorphic ciphertext dimension reduction scheme (QHEDR), the client can encrypt the quantum data and upload it to the cloud for computing. And through the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme to ensure security. After the calculation is completed, the client updates the key locally and decrypts the ciphertext result. We have implemented a quantum ciphertext dimensionality reduction scheme implemented in the quantum cloud, which does not require interaction and ensures safety. In addition, we have carried out experimental verification on the QPCE algorithm on IBM's real computing platform. Experimental results show that the algorithm can perform ciphertext dimension reduction safely and effectively.}

	abstract = {With the continuous development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency has drawn massive attention from various sectors. A full node on Bitcoin network has to store over 320GB of data as of March 9, 2021. According to the growth rate of Bitcoin transactions, it is estimated that the size of Bitcoin data on a full node will exceed 400GB within two years. The storage problem makes it difficult for common users to easily store all of Bitcoin data, which weakens the decentralization capability of Bitcoin network. In this work, we propose an efficient storage scheme (ESS) based on the distribution characteristics of the unspent transaction outputs in Bitcoin system. It can prune the storage of the transactions for those low query frequency blocks. When a new block is generated, a node using ESS scheme can quickly verify most of the transaction inputs. Only a small amount of transaction outputs of older blocks need to be retrieved from the full node for payment verification. Experimental results demonstrated that our scheme can reduce the size of a normal node in current Bitcoin system by about 85% at a low communication cost.}

To tackle this challenge, this paper focuses on developing a novel personalized recommendation approach based on complementary context-enhanced concept lattice. To be specific, the proposed approach constructs the concept lattices for both formal context and complementary context of user-item interactive data, and then adopts a Formal Concept Analysis based association rule recommendation algorithm for obtaining two recommendation result sets separately, and ultimately analyzes the acquisition of the final resulting recommendation for each of these two recommendation result sets under different situations. Taking movie recommendation as an illustrative example, more accurate user-preferred movie recommendation can be achieved. Compared with the traditional personalized recommendation algorithms, it is confirmed that our recommendation approach is more reasonable and effective in the real recommendation systems.}

	abstract = {Malware is widely regarded as one of the most severe security threats to modern technologies. Detecting malware in the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures is a critical and complicated task. The complexity of this task increases with the recent growth of malware variants targeting different IoT CPU architectures since the new malware variants often use anti-forensic techniques to avoid detection and investigation. There-fore, we cannot utilize the traditional machine learning (ML) techniques that require domain knowledge and sophisticated feature engineering in detecting the unseen mal ware variants. Re-cent deep learning approaches have performed well on mal ware analysis and detection while using minimum feature engineering requirements. In this paper, we propose BERTDeep- Ware, a real-time cross-architecture malware detection solution tailored for IoT systems. BERTDeep- Ware analyzes the executable file's operation codes (OpCodes) sequence representations using Bidi-rectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Embedding, the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) approach. The extracted sentence embedding from BERT is fed into a customized hybrid multi-head CNN-BiLSTM-LocAtt model. This deep learning (DL) model combines the convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and the local attention mechanisms (locAtt) to capture contextual features and long-term dependencies between OpCode sequences. We train and evaluate BERTDeep- Ware using the datasets created for three different CPU architectures. The performance evaluation results confirm that the proposed multi-head CNN-BiLSTM-LocAtt model produces more accurate classification results with higher detection rates and lower false positives than a number of baseline ML and DL models.}

	abstract = {In recent years, with the increase of industrial volume, problems such as difficult management and low efficiency have become obstacles to the development of industry. Many studies have shown that industry can complete the automation of industry by combining with Internet of Things, that is, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which will contribute to the secondary development of industry. However, in IIoT, there are also malicious attacks against industrial devices or sensors, such as DDoS, Sybil, etc., which will cause great security risks to the system. As a popular security trust framework, blockchain technology will face the dilemma of low throughput and limited energy if it is directly applied in the IoT devices. Based on this, in view of the existing IIoT security problems and the difficulties of traditional blockchain based on chain application, this paper proposes a blockchain security solution based on Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) structure for IIoT, and combines differential privacy technology to further ensure the privacy and integrity of data. In order to ensure the stability and anti-interference ability of the network, this paper also proposes a load balancing algorithm, which effectively balances the relationship between node power consumption and network lifetime. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the chain-blockchain scheme in network performance and power consumption. The average network delay is reduced by 24%, and the average network lifetime is increased by 48%.}

	abstract = {The modern network consists of thousands of network devices from different suppliers that perform distinct code-pendent functions, such as routing, switching, modifying header fields, and access control across physical and virtual networks. Because of the network complexity, the network is prone to a wide range of errors, such as false-positive configuration, software errors, or unexpected interactions across protocols. These errors can lead to loops, sub-optimal routing, path leaks, black holes, and access control violations that make services unavailable, vulnerable to exploitation, or prone to attacks (e.g., DDoS attacks). To mitigate these problems, network operators deploy many different stateful network functions, like firewalls, NATs, load balancers, and intrusion-prevention boxes. They have become an important part of networks today, so it is critical to verify that these network functions are the same as expected deployments. All static network verification tools are meant to rigorously check network software or configuration for bugs before deployment. They usually use handwritten models or limited derivation models that are error-prone and ignore the fact that even the same type of network functions (from different vendors) still have different implementation details. In this paper, we propose a tool that can automatically synthesize more realistic and high-fidelity models that include stateful network functions with non-field attributes. We design an inferring algorithm, implement the transformation between data packages and symbolic packages, and obtain a finite state machine that can accurately express the actions of black-box network functions for a given configuration.}

	abstract = {Phishing web page is one of the most serious threats to the users of the Internet. Traditional phishing web page detection methods rely on manually designed features. Recently, deep learning-based methods using HTML as input have achieved significant detection performance improvement. They usually treat HTML codes as sequences of characters and utilize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classification. However, CNN and RNN typically can only extract local features in the HTML code sequences while failing to model the long-range semantics that is crucial for phishing detection. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based phishing web page detection method that can effectively utilize the inherent structural information of HTML to capture the long-range semantics. We first naturally represent an HTML as a graph according to its Document Object Model (DOM) and utilize RNN to extract the local features of node attributes. Then we adopt GNN to model the long-range relations between nodes based on these local features and the graph structure. Our proposed model combines the advantage of RNN and GNN to better understand the intention of HTML codes. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the accuracy of our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.}

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that the properties of network traffic may reveal some patterns (such as, payload size, packet interval, etc.) that can expose users' identities and their private information. The existing defense approaches, such as traffic morphing, protocol tunneling, still suffer from revealing the special traffic pattern. To address this problem, we propose a feature-flux traffic camouflage method (FFTC). FFTC forecasts the pattern of normal traffic via twin Gaussian process(TGP), and dynamically change the on-going traffic feature based on the learned traffic pattern to conceal the camouflaged traffic in the normal traffic. TGP-based traffic forecasting makes FFTC more sensitive to the feature dynamics of normal traffic. Then, the camouflaged traffic can always synchronize with the normal traffic pattern in real time. Furthermore, FFTC can learn multiple traffic patterns from different kinds of normal traffic, and dynamically change the camouflaged traffic pattern to achieve the feature-flux ability. From the experimental results, FFTC improves the indistinguishability of the camouflaged traffic and the normal traffic, and the feature-flux of the camouflaged traffic mitigates the traffic analysis attack effectively.}

The existing steganography algorithms mainly focused on eliminating inter-block distortion and only embedded data in small-sized blocks, which did not take intra-block distortion into consideration and wasted large embedding capacity. In this paper, a HEVC steganography algorithm based on DCT/DST coefficients is proposed. It uses the intra-frame error propagation-free method to embed data in all blocks for eliminating inter-block distortion and especially, introduces CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) to reduce intra-block distortion.

	abstract = {Although Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are widely used in health care organisations, they still face security and privacy problems. Blockchain is considered a promising technology that could help overcome many of these problems. However, efforts to incorporate blockchain into EHR systems so far have shown heavy overhead, unsuitable software architectural structures and inefficient consensus protocols. We present ME Chain, a multi-layer blockchain structure, which aims to solve the adoption, storage and consensus problems when implementing blockchain in EHR systems. The multi-layer structure is better suited for the operational hierarchy in health organisations and is supported by the following novel features: (i) a consensus implementation optimised for the multi-layer operations, which solves the byzantine failure in both layers, hence guarantees consistency, it also reduces request confirmation latency and overhead and provides every layer with the ability to correct the faults, (ii) a data synchronisation method for some nodes that does not receive the correct information or simply get offline to catch up with the system, data verification and retrieve mechanisms to protect data integrity. Experiments are conducted to evaluate ME Chain in terms of security, performance and storage cost. The results show that ME Chain can establish a secure EHR with high performance and acceptable storage cost.}

In this paper, we propose a machine-learning based method to assign pertinent CWE identifiers to new CVE entries. The proposed method formulates the task as a multi-label classification problem and exploits positive and unlabeled learning to address the lack of multi-labelled samples in learning. In evaluations, the proposed method demonstrated preferable performance compared to traditional multi-label classifiers. In particular, case studies demonstrated that multiple CWE iden-tifiers assigned to CVE entries carry essential information that can benefit security practices.}

	abstract = {With continuous technological advancements, our homes become smarter by interconnecting more and more devices. Smart homes provide many advantages. However, they also introduce new privacy and security risks. Recent studies show that only a few people are aware of abstract risks, and most people are not aware of specific negative consequences. We developed a privacy and security awareness intervention for people who want to inform themselves about risks in the smart home context. Our intervention is based on research literature on risk perception and feedback from both lay users and security and privacy experts. We evaluated our intervention regarding its influence on participants' perceived threat, privacy attitude, motivation to avoid threats, willingness to pay, and time commitment to configure protective measures. The results of this evaluation show a significant increase for all these aspects. We also compared our intervention to information that users could obtain during an Internet search on the topic. In this comparison, our intervention evokes a significantly higher perceived threat and privacy attitude. It showed no significant difference for the other three scales. We discuss our findings in light of related work.}

However, unrated items may not be observed or may not be the user's genuine dislike. The paper solves the problem of classifying unrated items as single feedback in most implicit feedback recommendation scenarios. We proposed an adaptive multi-pairwise ranking with implicit feedback for a recommendation based on Multiple Pairwise Ranking with Implicit Feedback (MPR), namely MPR+. Our method divides unrated items into unknown preference items and negative feedback items according to the popularity ranking of the number of items rating by all users. Based on the MRP algorithm, by reducing the number of models, optimizing model selection, introducing dynamic parameters to reconstruct the target function. Experiments on four datasets show that the MPR+ model achieves satisfactory performance by dynamically adjusting parameters and outperforms the state-of-the-art implicit feedback approaches by using different evaluation metrics.}

	abstract = {In intelligent transportation system, UAV surveillance plays an important role, and it has wide applications in traffic detection and order management, etc. However, the interference of extensive buildings and inaccessible regions in the urban environment directly lead to the failure of the surveillance task. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes a method of multi-UAV UAV Cooperative Obstacle Avoidance and Surveillance (COAS). The ellipse tangent method is used to avoid obstacles for the interference of urban obstacles. Furthermore, taking into account the cooperation of multi-UAV formation, the cooperative model based on moving cost and formation stability is established. Due to the timeliness requirement of multi-UAV cooperative surveillance task, we use a sparrow search algorithm with fast convergence speed and strong optimization capability to solve the cooperative model. Finally, the simulation experimental results in an urban environment with obstacle information demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in tackling the issues of cooperative obstacle avoidance and target surveillance.}

	abstract = {We revisit the problem of Electronic Control Unit (ECU) identification from signal characteristics in the physical layer of in-vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN). Ringing is oscillation of a signal in signal processing and prior work has already noticed the ringing force in identifying ECUs via differ-ential CAN signaling. However, they either count on advanced do-main transformations or turn out to be fragile once CAN topology alters (e.g., the length of the stub lines, the number of connected ECUs, etc). The paper further dissects the connection between the ringing intensity and signal characteristics, based on which we can procure robust ECU identification scheme (and IDS, intrusion detection system) independent of CAN topology without any mathematical transformations. We first look into the factors enlarging signal ringing, and then abstract the characterization of ringing intensity where rising edges (from recessive to dominant states) and falling edges (from dominant to recessive states) make distinct contributions to ECU identification. The rising edges (along with dominant states) suffice to fingerprint the ECUs, whereas the falling edges pitch in shaky performance (correlated strongly to CAN topology). The unique contribution of the former can thereby be isolated to construct robust mechanisms for ECU identification and IDS. Robustness and accuracy of the resulting approach are validated on not only prototype implementations (with diverse portfolio in 3/6/9/13 ECUs and 1/2/3-meter stub lines) but real vehicles. Concrete comparisons among prior work and ours are also conducted and substantiate our argumentation and mechanisms.}

	abstract = {As the latest computing paradigm, edge computing has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in recent years. It significantly affects the design and development of many smart systems and challenges conventional security solutions. Therefore, a new security framework targeted for edge computing-based smart systems is urgently required. In this paper, we investigate various security issues in the edge computing-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) delivery system which is a typical system in smart logistics. Specifically, we focus on security issues related to abnormal intrusion detection, various security attacks, and authentication/access control. To address these security issues, we propose A2DSEC which is a novel security framework characterized by the capabilities such as detection, defense, and authentication. With A2DSEC, we can guarantee the security of user identity authentication, and provide effective early warnings so that corresponding security measures can be taken in a timely fashion. To verify the effectiveness of A2DSEC, we test and implement the core part of the framework on a real-world edge computing-based UAV delivery system. The experiment results show that the A2DSEC can effectively ensure the security of the UAV delivery system via the timely detection of a variety of attacks as well as unknown potential attacks.}

	abstract = {The paper goes into Bitcoin PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus, especially the variances of inter-block time and of mining reward which may turn out to be the origin of Bitcoin's fundamental weakness (e.g., unexpected centralization and double-spend attack). We procure a contribution-and-gain solution - LVRT, a collaborative PoW consensus with low variances of mining reward and of inter-block time, to intensify mining transparency and incentivize collaborative effort. More precisely, LVRT looses the solutions of cryptographic puzzles by introducing tweakable factor to difficulty target and exploits all qualified computing powers (rather than throws them all away except the first one that wins the puzzle, as handled in Bitcoin) to generate the block (all qualified miners would thereby be rewarded). Low variance of inter-block time also stems from our strategy in packing the block that k (a pre-defined system parameter to characterize collaborative effort) smallest out of all qualified hash values are determined and the corresponding average is bounded by difficulty target as well. We define particular block structure to fit our requirements. LVRT is supported by theoretical analysis on the relationship between collaborative effort and the variances of inter-block time and mining reward. Experiments further demonstrate LVRT's resistance against selfish-mining and double-spend attacks. For a double-spend attacker with 40% mining power, it will succeed in Bitcoin with a probability ≥ 35%, in contrast, his probability is less than 1% in LVRT (for k\\geq 50 ).}

	abstract = {The influence maximization (IM) problem, which aims to find k\nmost influential individuals from a social network to maximize the influence spread, has been extensively studied. Existing works all rely on the assumption that influenced individuals will definitely try to propagate the information to their neighbors through social trust. However, in real-world this assumption can be over-simplistic since trust-levels among different individuals usually exhibit high diversity. As a result, an influenced individual may choose not to further propagate the information to his neighbors. Motivated by the observation, in this paper we propose a new accepted influence maximization (AIM) problem where the influenced individuals are further divided into two subgroups, i.e., accepted and active, where only active individuals will continue to propagate the information. We prove this problem is NP-hard and the objective function is submodular, based on which a greedy algorithm is proposed with ( 1-1/e-\\epsilon\n) approximation guarantee. Considering the low computational efficiency of the greedy algorithm, we further propose a scalable path-based algorithm ALDAG. We conduct experiments on real datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, network traffic is growing explosively. It brings great challenges to the traditional traffic identification technology using full traffic analysis, which requires more resources to achieve the collection and analysis of full traffic. And, handling the raw traffic may lead to the compromise of user privacy. NetFlow has good compatibility with the existing routing or switching devices, can aggregate network traffic information, support traffic sampling, reduce the invasion of user privacy, and can effectively deal with the challenges. However, as NetFlow is usually output after traffic sampling to ensure the performance of network devices and only contains session-level statistical information, existing NetFlow research mostly focuses on the binary classification problems (e.g., specific anomaly traffic detection), and less exploration has been conducted on traffic multi-classification problems. And NetFlow is even less involved in the currently popular field of encrypted traffic classification. In this paper, we focus on how to perform encrypted traffic multi-classification research based on sampled NetFlow records and propose a multi-classification method based on the multi-source extension of sampled NetFlow records. To improve the distinguishability and applicability of the sampled NetFlow records, we extend and enrich the records with full consideration of the head or payload information in traffic data, including TTL values, Cipher Suites, etc. For different application scenarios, the methods based on head information extension and payload information extension are proposed, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments, the results show that the proposed method is more applicable and effective than the method based on a single N etFlow record in dealing with multi-classification problems in different encryption application scenarios.}

	abstract = {Logs are widely used in network security and management because they record runtime details in IT systems. It is difficult to gain insights from raw unstructured logs, so many researches first parse raw logs into structured templates. However, as the volume of logs grows rapidly, efficiency becomes a major concern in log parsing. In this paper, we propose a quick log parsing algorithm QuickLogS based on template similarity. QuickLogS utilizes regular expressions to replace the variables with wildcard and filters the reduplicate data to parse huge volume of unstructured logs into finite structured templates. To improve parsing efficiency, SimHash algorithm and Hamming distance are used to merge the similar templates of the same length. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply the SimHash algorithm to log parsing. Besides, different with other work, we also merge the similar templates of different lengths based on the cosine similarity algorithm, which contributes to improve the parsing accuracy. QuickLogS is evaluated on six real public log datasets, and compared with four state-of-the-art log parsing algorithms. The experimental results show that QuicklogS outperforms the other parsers in terms of efficiency and accuracy.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-powered smart systems deployed in different industrial applications promise operational efficiencies and improved yields, while mitigating significant cybersecurity risks pertaining to the main application. Associated tradeoffs between availability and security arise at implementation, however, triggered by the additional resources (e.g., memory, computation) required by each blockchain-enabled host. This paper applies an energy-reducing algorithmic engineering technique for Merkle Tree root calculations, a principal element of blockchain computations, as a means to preserve the promised security benefits but with less compromise to system availability. Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure computational energy, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of the Merkle Tree for different input sizes (in bytes). Our results show up to 98% reduction in energy consumption is possible within the blockchain's Merkle Tree construction module, such reductions typically increasing with larger input sizes. The proposed energy-reducing technique is similarly applicable to other key elements of blockchain computations, potentially affording even “greener” blockchain-powered systems than implied by only the Merkle Tree results obtained thus far.}

	abstract = {Mapping a binary function taken from a compiled binary to the same function in the original source code has many security applications, such as discovering reused free open source code in malware binaries. To facilitate malware analysis, we present BINDEEP, a framework that learns the semantic relationships among binary functions based on assembly code. It also learns semantic information about the source functions in order to carry out function matching. We demonstrate how BINDEEP can be applied to fingerprint the origin of functions in malware binaries, and then benchmark its performance against that of five competing systems (i.e., RESOURCE, the Binary Analysis Tool (BAT), BinPro, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and FOSSIL). The findings show that BINDEEP is more robust and achieves significant improvement over these existing systems when confronted with changes introduced by code transformation methods or the use of different compilers and optimization levels. Furthermore, BINDEEP is able to discover source packages in malware binaries, such as Zeus and Citadel, that match those listed in existing security reports.}

	abstract = {Existing electronic map apps, such as Baidu map, AutoNavi map, Google map, only provide the services “find k nearest POIs around me” and “give me the bus plan from s to d”. But they cannot answer “give me k POIs that I can reach earliest within one transfer by bus”. Such type of query is to find k nearest neighbors (kNN) on public transportation network (PTN), that is, returns k POIs whose arrival time are earliest starting from query location at some time and the number of required transfers is less than the user-specified constrain. Existing kNN algorithm on road network cannot be directly applied on PTN due to the more complex line combinations. Two algorithms TT-INE and TT-IER are proposed based on Incremental Network Expansion and Incremental Euclidean Restriction respectively. To address the loss of efficiency caused by the proliferation of alternative routes, a pruning strategy based on the route dominance relationship is designed. Moreover, to filter those stations who are not associated with POIs, a node compression method is also proposed, And a grid index is utilized to prune the POIs far away from the query based on the upper bound of arrival time. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the real data of Beijing's PTN. Experimental results show that the TT-INE algorithm with pruning strategy is two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional incremental expansion method. When POIs are sparse, i.e. the percentage of POIs is 1 %, TT-IER is an order of magnitude faster than TT-INE.}

	abstract = {Community networks are prone to free-riders, i.e., participants who take advantage of cooperation from others' routers but do not contribute reciprocally. In this paper, we present HARPIA, a system for credit-based incentive mechanisms for data forwarding in community networks aimed to prevent selfish behavior. HARPIA does not require a trusted third-party or tamper-resistant security modules as in other incentive mechanisms. Instead, it uses a distributed accounting scheme (DPIFA) to estimate the balance of data forwarding contribution and consumption of each network router and settle correspondent cryptocurrency debts on an Ethereum smart contract. On-chain settlement transactions are performed every HARPIA cycle (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and must be validated by at least m-of-n network routers using a multi-signature scheme (MuSig). We also realized a performance evaluation, security threat assessment, and cryptocurrency costs estimation. Results show that our proposal is suitable for community networks with up to 64 infrastructure routers under specific m-of-n MuSig thresholds.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, communication inefficiency remains the key bottleneck that impedes its large-scale implementation. Recently, hierarchical FL (HFL) has been proposed in which data owners, i.e., workers, can first transmit their updated model parameters to edge servers for intermediate aggregation. This reduces the instances of global communication and straggling workers. To enable efficient HFL, it is important to address the issues of edge association in the context of non-cooperative players, i.e., workers, edge servers, and model owner. However, the existing studies merely focus on static approaches and do not consider the dynamic interactions and bounded rationalities of the players. In this paper, we propose the edge association strategies of the workers to be modelled using an evolutionary game. Then, we provide numerical results to validate that our proposed framework captures the HFL system dynamics under varying sources of network heterogeneity.}

	abstract = {Cache side-channel attacks exploit cache state changes to steal confidential information. The emergence of transient execution attacks, a new form of microarchitecture side-channel attack that can access any address, makes cache side-channel attacks more threatening. Most of these attacks infer information by measuring the execution time of load operations. Therefore, from the microarchitecture perspective, we propose a novel countermeasure against cache side-channel attacks by eliminating the access time difference caused by cache hits or misses. We use the constant-time loading mechanism to limit each load instruction's execution to a fixed time and specify this mechanism's wake-up condition to avoid excessive performance loss. We modify the CPU pipeline to simulate this design and run SPEC2006 applications. The results show that the performance loss of our mechanism is negligible.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology can provide immutability, provenance and traceability in supply chains. To utilize Blockchain's full potential, it is important to link supply chain events to the relevant entities for traceability and accountability purposes. Authorized participation is realised through consortium of various organisations. Transactions are verified by peer nodes pertaining to the consortium. Hence, privacy preservation of trade sensitive information such as trade flows and locations of production, storage and retail sites cannot be ascertained. In this work, we propose a privacy-preservation framework, TradeChain, which decouples the trade events of participants using decentralised identities. TradeChain adopts the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles and makes the following novel contributions: a) it incorporates two separate ledgers: a public permissioned blockchain for maintaining identities and the permissioned blockchain for recording trade flows, b) it uses Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on traders' private credentials to prove multiple identities on trade ledger and c) allows data owners to define dynamic access rules for verifying traceability information from the trade ledger using access tokens and Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE). A proof of concept implementation of TradeChain is presented on Hyperledger Indy and Fabric and an extensive evaluation of execution time, latency and throughput reveals minimal overheads.}

	abstract = {The gas mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain attempts to set charges for every smart contract operation in order to prevent infinite control of computational resources by the executing transactions. To satisfy this requirement, users need to specify in their transactions how much gas fees (in terms of gas limit and gas price) they would like to pay for. In essence, these gas fees are paid to the miners in return for their computational services. Naturally, miners tend to maximize their profits by considering the transactions with higher gas fees, and as a result, the transactions with lower gas fees remain in the waiting pool for a long time. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to predict whether a transaction with offered gas fees is likely to be included in the blockchain within the expected time or not. Such prior prediction of transactions' waiting time definitely assists users to reset their gas fees accordingly. The proposed model is evaluated on nearly one million real transactions from Ethereum mainnet, and the experimental results demonstrate a better performance than the existing one in the literature, with an achievement of 90.18% accuracy and 0.897 F1-score when the model is trained with Random Forest on the dataset balanced with SMOTETomek.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) simplies the coniguration and management of security services by migrating the network security functions from dedicated hardware devices to software middle-boxes that run on commodity servers. Under the paradigm of NFV, the service function chain (SFC) consisting of a series of ordered virtual network security functions is becoming a mainstream form to carry network security services. Allocating the underlying physical network resources to the demands of SFCs under given constraints over time is known as the SFC deployment problem. It is a crucial issue for infrastructure providers. However, SFC deployment is facing new challenges in trading off between pursuing the objective of a high revenue-to-cost ratio and making decisions in an online manner. In this paper, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning to guide online deployment decisions for SFC requests and propose a Policy network Assisted Monte Carlo Tree search approach named PACT to address the above challenge, aiming to maximize the average revenue-to-cost ratio. PACT combines the strengths of the policy network, which evaluates the placement potential of physical servers, and the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is able to tackle problems with large state spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our PACT achieves the best performance and is superior to other algorithms by up to 30% and 23.8% on average revenue-to-cost ratio and acceptance rate, respectively.}

	abstract = {Blockchains are append-only data structures, meaning their size increases steadily. As of March 2021, new nodes connecting to the Bitcoin blockchain already need to synchronize and validate more than 330 GB of data. Already now, this is an issue for resource-constrained thin clients who lack the required download, storage, or computing capacities to achieve this. In future, this issue will become even more relevant when blockchain technology is applied to new domains like the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose a new blockchain architecture that addresses this issue. Our proposal relies on incremental snapshot blocks that allow new and occasionally used clients to synchronize with the current state of the blockchain efficiently. The snapshot blocks form a second linked blockchain and are secured by the blockchain consensus algorithm. In this paper, we describe the proposed architecture in detail and evaluate its storage-saving potential using the Bitcoin blockchain. The evaluations performed show that our design can reduce the volume of data that needs to be downloaded and stored by up to 98%, thus facilitating secure blockchain-based applications also on resource-constrained thin clients like smartphones, netbooks, or IoT devices.}

	abstract = {The blockchain system allows various trans-actions and information storage to be executed in a decentralized manner, while smart contracts require multiple nodes to be executed in the local sandbox environment according to preset settings to ensure the consistency of each node, which makes smart contracts unable to proactively obtain data from the outside world. Decentralized oracle can realize the acquisition of off-chain data with a low speed under the premise of ensuring the decentralization of the blockchain. Some oracles use on-chain data storage and maintenance to speed up data acquisition, but this will face higher costs of data storage and maintenance, so current oracles cannot simultaneously ensure privacy and security while taking into account execution cost and processing speed. In this article, we propose Select-Storage, a new oracle design pattern to achieve low operating cost and high processing speed without compromising security. Through experimental analysis, and comparison with other design patterns in processing time and on-chain and off-chain call costs, we have proved the superiority of the Select-Storage design pattern.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has found extensive applications in recent years, especially in financial and currency exchange applications, due to improved trustworthiness and security. Although blockchain technology improves security by design, it is not immune to security threats and vulnerabilities. Ethereum, as a decentralized, open-source blockchain, has shown high growth and widespread adoption in recent years, however, there is a wide range of vulnerability, security risks, and also attacks around it. To tackle such issues, machine learning could be a viable solution for threat hunting in the Ethereum blockchain. Machine learning algorithms, by analyzing the behav-ioral patterns, can achieve an insight for threat hunting. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based model for Ethereum threat hunting. The model applies a deep neural network for attack detection and uses a combination of machine learning algorithms (unsupervised with supervised algorithms) for attack classification. The performance evolution of the proposed model in terms of accuracy presents 97.72 % in Ethereum attack detection and 99.4% in attack classification.}

	abstract = {Single-Sign-On (SSO) systems usage has been on the rise exponentially. One of the major benefits of having an SSO system is to have a central authentication service, which other applications can use. SSO services are prone to one-point failure problem. If an SSO service becomes unavailable due to failure, every application using the SSO service become simultaneously inaccessible to users. This work explores applicability of blockchain to mitigate the availability (one-point failure) issue of SSO systems. It was concluded, while blockchain might add overhead to the system, it presents a way to handle the one-point failure problem of SSO.}

	abstract = {To achieve user identities protection in transaction, the stealth address is introduced. However, double-key stealth address protocol (DKSAP) requires the receiver to continuously calculate and determine whether it is the real receiver of the transaction until it detected a transaction that matches. In this process, the receiver needs to perform many time-consuming elliptic curve scalar multiplication operations, which limits the application of DKSAP in low-performance devices, such as mobile terminals, IoT devices, etc. This paper proposes an efficient double-key stealth address protocol based on bilinear mapping, EDKSAP. Senders calculate the transaction temporary output address and receivers perform the verification calculation using bilinear mapping, which achieves the purpose of improving computing performance. Finally, we verify the feasibility and applicability of the protocol through experiments. In addition, the experimental results show that the computational performance of EDKSAP is significantly improved compared to DKSAP.}

In other words, while preserving the public immutability of the blockchain, to allow some administrators or trusted centers with higher authority to modify the content on the blockchain without violating the integrity of the entire blockchain. In this paper, we proposed a redactable blockchain scheme based on unforgeable signatures. Compared with the existing blockchain editing solutions, this paper's solution can be efficiently and conveniently integrated into the current blockchain technology. This scheme's security is based on the collision-resistant hash function used by the original immutable blockchain and the unforgeability of the signature scheme. Besides, our solution can quickly confirm whether a chain has correctly implemented modifications issued by the central authority through the merge verification of signatures.}

	abstract = {In recent years, as an important means of digital image copyright protection, image invisible watermarking technology has attracted more and more attention. Based on the watermarking system built by deep learning model, this paper proposes an optimization algorithm which can extract watermark and improve robustness. The watermark is embedded and extracted by the encoder and decoder of the model respectively. In order to make the model robust to various image attacks, two noise layers are added to the model. In order to further improve the robustness and concealment of watermark, adversarial training is used. In order to improve the accuracy of model joint training, a two-step training strategy is adopted. The first step is to train the best pre training model of encoder and decoder. The second step is to train different decoders according to different image attack means, so as to improve the robustness of the whole watermarking system. Experimental results show that, compared with other watermarking algorithms based on deep learning model, the proposed method is superior to other algorithms in the concealment and robustness.}

Remote patient monitoring provides an opportunity for COVID-19 patients to have vital signs and other indicators recorded regularly and inexpensively to provide rapid and early warning of conditions that require medical attention using secured edge and cloud computing.

The main challenges of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tracking are complex background and mutual occlusion. In this work, we propose a simple online UAV tracking with Transformer. It uses the encoder-decoder mechanism to introduce a set of object query in the pipeline, which can achieve the detection of new targets accurately. This method uses an online joint-detection-and-tracking pipeline based on the encoder-decoder mechanism. The complex and multi-step components in the previous method are simplified. Further, it is a new structure based on Transformer. Object query detects the object in the current frame. The object feature query in the previous frame associates these current objects with the previous object. We proposed a method that can be well applied to small targets such as UAVs, achieved 64.1% MOTA competition on the MOT15 challenge dataset.}

The use of deep neural networks in anomaly detection is to build a model through the training set, enabling the model to predict the user's next action or command based on the given first n actions or commands. The network trains the command set commonly used by users. After a period, the network can match the real commands according to the existing user characteristic files in the network, and any mismatched events or commands are regarded as anomalies. The detection of anomaly user behaviors is an imbalanced classification problem. To address imbalanced classification problem, we propose an imbalanced self-paced sampling method to improve the efficiency of anomaly user behavior detection. The results show that the DNNs model can usually find anomaly user behaviors that are not easily detectable by other models in anomaly detection.}

	abstract = {The applications of location-based services(LBS) are increasingly important in people's daily life. However, these services may lead to privacy leakage, which causes more and more users to worry about privacy issues. Although the differential privacy technology has solved some location privacy problems, most of the current models are still unable to resist complex background-knowledge attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy for trajectory based on prefix tree. Firstly, we use the Hilbert curve to split the trajectory position points which the optimal divisions are selected by the index mechanism, and obtain the center point of each area. Secondly, we build a noisy prefix tree to store location points, it should be noted that the nodes of the tree store the polymerization location points. Finally, an arithmetic distribution method is applied to the privacy budget, meanwhile the amount of noise is limited by a threshold. The proposed algorithm is compared with related algorithm on the original dataset. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper improves data availability while ensuring data privacy.}

The system consists of wearable active tags, main and sub anchors, servers, and clients. Firstly, alternative double-sided two-way ranging (ADS-TWR) combined with digital filter and linear fitting is used to pre-process the noise and bias of the ranging results, obtaining the anchor-tag distance with an error less than 10cm. In order to resolve the problem of position outliers caused by random factors in the mine, the position of the moving target is estimated by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) initially. Then the mean filter (MF) will perform a secondary optimization of the results. Experimental results show that the positioning accuracy of the system reaches 0.06m in the line-of-sight environment. The positioning accuracy is improved effectively and the system shows a strong anti-noise performance.}

Aiming at the problems of low prediction accuracy and unsatisfactory classification results in existing random forest classification algorithms with privacy protection, a high-accuracy differential privacy protection random forest classification algorithm (DPFMaxTree) is proposed. First, based on the existing Max attribute measurement, a new attribute measurement method F _Max is designed to improve the classification accuracy of a single decision tree; Secondly, combined with a new privacy budget allocation mechanism, the datasets with continuous attributes are discretized by the exponential mechanism using CART algorithm, then Laplace mechanism is used to add noise, and the algorithm uses the F_Max attribute measurement to construct the DPFMaxTree classification algorithm. Experimental result on real datasets shows that the new algorithm can perform classification predictions well under a reasonable privacy budget.}

The k-d tree is used in this paper to address the computational challenges. The shortest distance between the normal lines of two points in the neighborhood of a certain point is calculated to determine whether the intersection of normal lines needs to be calculated. The RANSAC algorithm is used to fit the line to the normal lines intersections to obtain the axis. The axis extraction method is tested on cone, cylinder, spindle, and incomplete shapes of them. the error of extracted axis is small, indicating the feasibility of this method.}

	abstract = {Human trajectory prediction is essential for avoiding collisions in crowded environments in the navigation of autonomous driving system. In the past few years, human trajectory prediction based on deep learning methods has been extensively studied and significant progress has been made. However, both the social interactions among pedestrians and the intention of the pedestrians are unpredictable. They cause great difficulty in forecasting the future paths. Previous methods use recurrent architectures which will produce lots of inefficient parameters in training process and lead to the low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict human trajectory by using stacked temporal convolutional network. First, we use a kernel function to embed the social interactions among pedestrians with the adjacency matrix. Next, we represent a spatial temporal representation of all pedestrian in the scene. Then, we conduct a spatial temporal embedding for observed trajectories. Finally, the stacked temporal convolutional network receives the features extracted by spatial temporal network and predicts the future human trajectories. The proposed approach is a data-driven approach which combines the advantages of spatial temporal graph convolutional network and stacked temporal convolutional network. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our stacked temporal method has high data efficiency and outperforms the existing methods.}

	abstract = {Access control models have been developed to control authorized access to sensitive resources. This control of access is important as there is now a need for collaborative resource sharing between multiple organizations over open environments like the internet. Although there are multiple access control models that are being widely used, these models are providing access control within a closed environment i.e. within the organization using it. These models have restricted capabilities in providing access control in open environments. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has emerged as a powerful access control model to bring fine-grained authorization to organizations which possess sensitive data and resources and want to collaborate over open environments. In an ABAC system, access to resources that an organization possess can be controlled by applying policies on attributes of the users. These policies are conditions that need to be satisfied by the requester in order to gain access to the resource. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ABAC and by carrying forward the architecture of ABAC, we propose a Decentralized Policy Information Point (PIP) model. Our model proposes the decentralization of PIP, which is an entity of the ABAC model that allows the storage and query of user-attributes and enforces fine-grained access control for controlling the access of sensitive resources over multiple-domains. Our model makes use of the concept of a cryptographic primitive called Attribute Based Signature (ABS) to keep the identities of the users involved, private. Our model can be used for collaborative resource sharing over the internet. The evaluation of our model is also discussed to reflect the application of the proposed decentralized PIP model.}

Using the mobile application, it is possible to make bank transfers, communicate with patients for applications used in medicine and many others. Popularity, unfortunately, also brings many risks. With the development of the Internet and information technology, the range of opportunities for cyber-criminals has developed. With the increasing popularity of systems and mobile devices, we can also observe an increase in attacks and the number of malicious software targeted for these technologies. The development of the mobile application fulfills more and more important role in the everyday lives of the visibly growing number of smartphone and tablet users, especially from the point of view of security aspects.

	abstract = {Recently, it is generally acknowledged that the receptive field size of visual cortical neurons are regulated by the stimulus in the neuroscience community. Thus, once the global receptive field is obtained, the network performance can be greatly improved. Unfortunately, the larger receptive field method has been rarely considered in constructing CNNs. Recent studies on network design have demonstrated that the key to improving model performance is channel attention. However, they usually neglect the location information. Hence, it is difficult to capture the long-term dependency of location information. In particular, the location information is important for generating spatially selective attention blocks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attention neural network termed “GEA” by embedding global context information into channel attention. Firstly, instead of channel attention, which is transformed from feature tensor to single feature vector via 2D pooling, our method decomposes the channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along two spatial directions. In particular, the long-term dependency can be captured by using one spatial direction as well as preserving accurate location information in the opposite direction. Then, we concatenate the results of the two directions, while carry out batch normalization and use relu activation function. In addition, the cross channel soft attention is used to adaptively select different spatial scales of the information. Finally, our method is simple and can be flexibly inserted into classic networks, such as ResNet and EfficientNet, with limited computational overhead. A large number of experiments show that our method is not only conducive to the classification of COCO and ImageNet, but also demonstrates promising performance for 3D features, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI).}

	abstract = {This paper presents an initial effort for the trusted geolocation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices based on the booming low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. As the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reception cannot always be guaranteed at LEO satellites, the recently developed direct position determination (DPD) approach is adopted. For such passive localization systems, the efficient DPD execution is challenging due to the vast coverage area of LEO satellites. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we propose a method to narrow the search area using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements and error variances. In this way, the size of the searching area is determined by both geometrical constraints and qualities of received signals, and signals with a higher SNR are more effective in positioning as their search areas are usually smaller. The superior accuracy performance of the proposed method is also verified through the comparison with conventional two-step methods. Mento Carlo simulations show that the proposed approach provides a robust and trusted localization service, and the positioning error is less than 10 kilometers when the SNR is lower than −15dB.}

In this paper, we propose an analysis and evaluation scheme for the data after the communication performance of vehicle devices in large-scale tests, add the evaluation indexes of interval delay jitter and throughput, and propose some improvement schemes for the existing test data saving format.}

In this paper, the beam hopping (BH) algorithms of LS-LEOSCN are overviewed. Firstly, we described the system model on LS-LEOSCN and formulated the BH problem, considering the beam coverage, user distribution, traffic flow and channel capacity model. Secondly, the meta-heuristic based, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based and hybrid BH algorithms are summarized. Finally, the simulation is conducted to compare different BH algorithms in LS-LEOSCN. Simulation results show that the hybrid algorithms such as PSO-GA perform better than traditional GA or SA based BH algorithms.}

Due to the rapid changes in the wireless channel due to the high mobility of vehicles, the traditional resource allocation technology is no longer suitable for the current vehicle network. This paper proposes a joint resource allocation method for the internet of vehicles communication based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm. In this paper, a joint optimization scheme of discrete and continuous resources suitable for the internet of vehicles communication is designed to effectively meet the strict requirements of vehicle-mounted communication. Simulation results show that the proposed allocation method can maximize the system capacity and satisfy the delay constraints of vehicle-to-vehicle communication.}

The NR and LTE may share the common 700MHz band spectrum, which may improve the existing 4G users' experience and the overall system (NR & LTE) efficiency. Dynamic power sharing methodology can be considered for the spectrum sharing process to improve user perception. After 700MHz NR construction and commercialization, it can be considered to couple with the 2.6GHz and 4.9GHz of NR TDD to complement the wide-area coverage, deep indoor coverage, and hotspot capacity of the overall network.}

On the basis of big data of antenna and feed fault, this paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) based fault classifier of antenna and feed, in order to quickly classify the faults of antenna and feed system (AFS). In addition, the improved Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN) learning algorithm is employed to establish a fault diagnosis device of antenna and feed to quickly diagnose various categories of faults. For the fault model of antenna and feed, we continue to learn and train to optimize the fault classifier model, as well as the fault diagnosis model. For the fault diagnosis information, the antenna and feed fault classifier is used to update the classified faults, which empower the antenna and feed fault classification more accurate.}

	abstract = {The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) is composed of satellite systems, high altitude platform base stations, low altitude platform stations and so on. The NTN network plays an important role in the ubiquitous and intelligent connection to all things on earth for 6G system. Meanwhile, the use of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) as IMT Base Stations (HIBS) is a significant part in the NTN network. HIBS has the advantages of wide coverage, flexible deployment, low delay and low construction cost, and attracts the attention of many international organizations and countries. In order to promote the specification of HIBS, ITU-R WRC-19 had resolved to identify WRC-23 Agenda Item 1.4: study the use of HIBS in the mobile service in certain frequency bands below 2.7 GHz already identified for IMT. This paper is based on WRC-23 AI 1.4, and focus on the frequency band 900MHz which has better wide coverage characteristics. Considering the spectrum refinement on the terrestrial network, from 2G/3G to 4G in suburban and rural areas, this paper focus on the sharing and compatibility study between HIBS and 4G LTE system.}

	abstract = {Aiming at the current high energy consumption problem of the Internet of Things data center, and the static state of the traditional data center network architecture is not convenient to the design and deployment of energy consumption optimization strategies, this paper specifically proposes a new energy consumption optimization strategy under the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture, the control plane is separated from the data plane. The control plane is divided into two layers, bottom layer and top layer. The bottom layer controllers are uniformly scheduled by the upper layer controller. In order to reduce the computational pressure of the upper-level controller and make full use of the computing power of the bottom level controller, the relationship between the bottom layer controllers in this article is non-cooperative. On this basis, two energy efficiency strategies are designed in this paper. The first one is Strategy For Nash Equilibrium Point (SFNEP). The second one is Strategy For Energy Optimal(SFEO). The target of SFNEP is to search for the Nash Equilibrium Point. The target of SFEO is to gain energy efficiency via running SFNEP. Through extensive simulations, we show that SFEO has a better energy consumption optimization effect than other benchmark strategies. Under ideal condition, energy saving ratio is able to reach 24%.}

Then we propose the Optimized Decision Tree using Multiple-Target Particle Swarm Optimization (DT-MTPSO) algorithm. Experiment shows that the proposed algorithm can solve the Multiple-Target problems effectively and has better performance in F1-score than traditional Decision Tree.

	abstract = {Since the State Council of China issued the “Outline of Action to Promote the Development of Big Data” in 2015, which proposed a top-level design for big data development from a long-term perspective, the related industry had ushered in a rapid way. At present, under the background of accelerating digital transformation and post COVID-19, the social and economic benefits of data assets, especially the value of financial data turn out to be more prominent. In this paper, we analyze four exploration aspects of commercial banks around big data application: constructing enterprise-level big data platforms, strengthening the capability of risk control, innovating financial products and services, optimizing business processes. Meanwhile, giving the typical cases for all of these practices, we illustrate how the bank's decision-making transformed from “experience-dependent” to “data-based” that enable banks to improve business performance, assess credit risks and allocate resources scientifically. Generally, we hold the view that big data technology has become an important means for commercial banks to meet the emerging financial demands, respond to the competition of the fintechs and the high-level opening-up trend. At last, this paper suggests banks enhance the core competitiveness through big data deep application with facing challenges such as insufficient implementation of big data strategy, lack of data governance system, imperfect organizational structure as well as scarcity of data mining talents.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) becomes more and more popular. IaaS customers may not clearly know the actual performance of each cloud platform. Moreover, there are no unified standards in performance evaluation of IaaS VMs (virtual machine). The underlying virtualization technology of IaaS cloud is transparent to customers. In this paper, we will design an automated performance benchmarking platform which can automatically install, configure and execute each benchmarking tool with a configuration center. This platform can easily visualize multidimensional benchmarking parameters data of each IaaS cloud platform. We also rented four IaaS VMs from AliCloud-Beijing, AliCloud-Qingdao, UCloud and Huawei to validate our benchmarking system. Performance comparisons of multiple parameters between multiple platforms were shown in this paper. However, in practice, customers' applications running on VMs are often complex. Performance of complex applications may not depend on single benchmarking parameter (e.g. CPU, memory, disk I/O etc.). We ran a TPC-C test for example to get overall performance in MySQL application scenario. The effects of different benchmarking parameters differ in this specific scenario.}

A prediction analysis scheme is proposed. The prediction scheme is based on Lasso regression machine learning algorithm which can reduce the co-linearity between different weather conditions.

	abstract = {Most MANET's topologies have the feature of non-uniform distribution, so the routing protocol based on random distribution topology is no longer applicable. A node betweenness reinforcement learning routing strategy based on network topology control (BRLR) is proposed. In this strategy, parameters such as residual energy and link quality are used to measure the quality of neighbor nodes, and the topology is established. The strategy introduces the node betweenness as a reward factor, and uses reinforcement learning method to establish data forwarding rules. Simulation results show that BRLR has good performance in end-to-end delay, route establishment success rate and so on.}

Existing approaches create service flows under the assumption that network context changes are slower than the time required to plan the composite service which is no longer set up in the mobile and pervasive computing environment. In this paper, we propose an online automatic service composition approach to dynamically construct service flows and interleave the planning and executing processes. Particularly, it introduces a novel distributed heuristic searching algorithm to determine solutions with limited knowledge bases and execute them in real time. Simulation results show that our proposed online approach reduces the composition time and performs faster composition time and higher composition success rates than state-of-the-art approaches in mobile computing environments.}

	abstract = {While deploying on edge devices, deep learning mod-els often encounter various strict resource constraints. Automated machine learning becomes popular in finding various neural architectures that fit diverse Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios to handle these problems with less human efforts. Recently, there is an emerging trend to integrate federated learning and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to prevent private data leakage while enabling automated machine learning. The algorithm development is quite challenging because of the coupling of difficulties from both tenets, although promising as it may seem. Especially, it is a hard nut to efficiently search the optimal neural architecture directly from massive non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data among IoT devices in a federated manner. In this paper, by leveraging the advances in ProxylessNAS, we propose a Federated Direct Neural Architecture Search (FDNAS) framework that allows hardware-friendly NAS from non-IID data across devices to tackle the challenge. Extensive experiments on non-IID datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs achieved by proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed framework for machine learning (ML) model training. Training agents upload local model parameters rather than original training data, and the central server performs parameter aggregation. FL can protect user data privacy and break the information island when training the ML model. Federated Average (FedAvg) is an aggregation method commonly used in the FL training task. The central server calculates the mean value of the local model parameters to obtain the new global parameters. FedAvg assumes that all the training agents are honest, which means the central server lacks terminal agents' knowability. When there are attackers in the training agents, the global model's performance may be deeply affected, and the training task cannot be completed normally. To solve this problem, we propose a Federated Learning method with aggregation based on the Importance of training agent (FedIM), in which the central server performs pre-evaluation on the agent parameters before aggregation, calculates the weights of parameters according to the historical behavior records of training terminals and performs federated aggregation to improve the anti-poisoning ability of learning task. Experiments show that our method can effectively improve the global model's anti-poisoning ability and accelerate the training speed compared with the FedAvg method when malicious agents are involved.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of sensors, many research efforts in recent years have focused on the wireless sensor networks. Since a wireless sensor network consists of a large number of sensors, its trusted communication become a hot research topic. Sensor ontology matching technology is able to solve the sensor information heterogeneity problem, which ensures the communication quality among different wireless sensor networks. In the matching process, different classes of similarity measures have different contributions in matching sensor ontologies. How to determine the optimal weights to aggregate multiple similarity measures to obtain high quality ontology alignment becomes a challenge in sensor ontology matching domain. To face this challenge, this work proposes a neural network-based sensor ontology matching technique. In particular, a single layer perceptron is used to aggregate multiple similarity measures and the neural model is trained with different training examples to obtain higher ontology matching accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to determine higher quality alignment results compared to other matchers under different domain knowledge such as bibliographic and real sensor ontologies.}

Firstly, the unstructured data is collected from the content of the disciplinary inspection and supervision report. Through the bottom-up method the notification concept layer is constructed. By using deep learning models to extract entities. Then the entities and semantic relations are stored in the graph database Neo4j and displayed in the form of a knowledge graph. This method realizes the whole process from unstructured data to knowledge graph, and provides technical reference for the construction of domain-based knowledge graph. Simultaneously, the knowledge map of discipline inspection field established through the example can find the hidden association between those who break the law and discipline, prevent criminal facts in advance, and provide support and help for discipline inspection personnel to implement the spirit of the eight-point regulation of the Central Committee and continue to fight against the “four winds” and other actions.}

The network captured features at different time steps will contribute to the final RUL prediction to varying degrees. Therefore, a deep learning network based on the attention mechanism is proposed. Firstly, the raw sensor data is passed to the Bi-LSTM network to capture the long-term dependence of features. Secondly, the features extracted by Bi-LSTM are passed to the attention mechanism for feature weighting, thereby giving greater weight to important features. Finally, the weighted features are input into the fully connected network to predict the RUL of the turbofan engine. Using the data set C-MAPSS to explore the feasibility of this method. The results show that this method is more accurate than other RUL prediction methods.}

	abstract = {Digital PCR is a brand-new nucleic acid molecule quantitative technology. Droplet digital PCR is a technology that performs amplification reaction on droplets containing DNA molecules and absolute quantification of target DNA molecules. How to use effective methods to amplify DNA double-stranded state is the focus of this paper. First, design the amplification mechanism to provide a reaction environment with good heat preservation and sealing for the PCR reaction. Next, design the temperature control module, and use the integral separation PID algorithm to achieve precise temperature control. In addition, it is necessary to prepare a reaction system for amplification, including the reasonable selection of target DNA, primers and probes, which are the basic conditions for verifying the amplification effect. Finally, use a PCR detection to detect the number of amplified droplets, and analyze the data to verify the effectiveness of the amplification quality. The experimental results show that the temperature rise and fall rate of the amplification system are greater than 4°C/s, the temperature overshoot is less than 0.3°C, and the static error is less than 0.2°C after the temperature is stabilized. After the droplet amplification, the positive band and negative band are distinct, which fully meets the amplification requirements in digital PCR.}

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG), as an important method for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, can record the heart activity over a period of time. However, most of the current studies on ECG classification focus on the single scale information and ignore the complementary information between different scales. Therefore, this paper proposed an end-to-end multi-scale fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) for heartbeat classification. In this method, multiple convolution kernels of different reception domains are used to extract unique features of different scales, and the extracted multiple scale features are fused, which could effectively capture disease patterns and suppress noise interference. At the same time, attention module is used to select features to improve model performance. Improve efficiency with residual module. Finally, we obtained 34, 983 heartbeats from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset to validate the model performance. The overall Fl-score is 99. 69%, and the Fl-score of each single class is more than 99. 35%, which is better than the existing algorithms. It can be described as a reference for future research.}

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a common diagnostic basis for heart disease. Reliable waveform detection method for ECG has important applications in clinical diagnosis. This work proposes a new method for P- and T- wave detection based on auxiliary waveform. The algorithm includes three parts: preprocessing, construction of auxiliary waveforms and P- and T-wave position detection. First, the ECG signal is preprocessed to remove baseline drift and high-frequency noise. Then, the auxiliary waveforms is constructed in the P- and T-wave searching windows which are defined based on the QRS wave position. Next, on the basis of the prominence of the auxiliary waveform, each lead of the 12-lead ECG signal is weighted and the final auxiliary waveform is constructed. Finally the P/T-wave positions are detected according to the auxiliary waveform memory. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a 12-lead manually annotated database. Standard deviations of 26.55 and 30.92 ms were obtained for the onset and offset of T-wave respectively, the standard deviation of the onset and offset of P-wave is 13.25 and 15.7 ms. The algorithm we proposed can provide reference for following research.}

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are two more common rapid atrial arrhythmias, they are independent of each other and can transform each other. Because the clinical characteristics of the two diseases are similar, it is easy to cause misdiagnosis. Therefore, effective diagnosis of distinguishing atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter can reduce the damage suffered by patients during treatment. In this paper, we propose a kind of based on residual network and multi-scale feature fusion structure of neural network to automatically classify atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and other ECG signals. The ECG signals used are derived from clinical data labeled by expert diagnosis. In addition, we used several popular classification methods proposed in the past for comparative experiments to verify the classification performance of our models. The experimental results show that the total F1, recall and precision of the proposed algorithm are 0.923, 0.916 and 0.93. The algorithm we propose has the potential to provide reference for subsequent research.}

	abstract = {The detection of consecutive cardiac cycles plays an important role in the daily monitoring of cardiovascular diseases. The Seismocardiogram (SCG) signal measures the cardiac-induced vibrations and is suitable for continuously tracking since it can be measured in a non-invasive fashion. In this paper, a beat-to-beat heart rate detection method based on low-frequency SCG signal using BiLSTM network is proposed. The regression model to predict Electrocardiogram (ECG) from SCG was trained on CEBS dataset and a 5-fold cross-validation method was adopted. The RMSE of the predicted ECG signal and ECG signal was 0.0367. The sensitivity and precision achieved 0.97 and 0.98 separately and the Spearman Correlation was 0.98. This work shows promise for the proposed SCG based methodology to be used as an alternative to ECG for continuous beat-to-beat heart rate monitoring.}

Under this background, personalized recommendation has been comprehensively researched in order to provide a more time-saving and accurate way for information retrieval. In this paper, a novel hybrid recommendation scheme based on collaborative filtering and association rules is put forward to compensate the weaknesses of individual algorithms. This scheme is implemented through several steps. Firstly, it solves the problem of data sparsity with the help to association rules, and then employs the revised collaborative filtering to calculate the similarity among the items. Finally, it predicts user ratings for the unknown items based on item similarity and generates recommendation lists according to the prediction ratings. Experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of this hybrid scheme has been dramatically improved compared to other traditional algorithms.}

The multi-antenna technology is an effective means to increase system capacity compared with networks extension. The more the antenna arrays are, the narrower the beams become to achieve better isolation and interference control. Based on narrow beams formed by beam-forming, the same spectrum resources are reused in the same geographic area to obtain resource multiplexing gains. Negatively, as the multi-antenna solution, coverage overlapping increases and inter-cell load imbalance occurs accordingly, which is a key problem to be addressed in the network optimization practice.}

	abstract = {5G mobile edge computing (MEC) can be used in intelligent manufacturing. In complex industrial application scenarios, this paper tries to address the problem of energy consumption optimization of customer task unloading and resource rescheduling. Specifically, we employ 5G wireless private network and MEC computing resources between 5G private network and MEC. Then, we use game theory algorithm to optimize the user task unloading and resource rescheduling allocation, which is mainly measured by the minimum total time required to complete the task and energy consumption. The problem is a combinatorial nonlinear programming algorithm, involving joint optimization of task offloading decision, user side's uplink transmission energy consumption, MEC server's resource allocation. The solution includes the resource allocation of fixed task unloading decision, and the resource allocation optimization of task unloading. Results verify the proposed solution can improve the efficiency of task scheduling.}

	abstract = {5G is the focus of global communication technology research, the important engine to improve the level of the national economy and informatization. With the commercial deployment of 5G network, more and more research institutions and related personnel begin to research on the net generation mobile communication system –6G. In wireless communication systems, compared with FDD, TDD technology does not require paired spectrum resources, which is more suitable for current and future wireless communication heterogeneous networks with asymmetric uplink and downlink diversified data streams. However, in a system using TDD technology, cells with different traffic conditions will use different uplink and downlink configurations, which will introduce cross-slot interference between cells and affect the improvement of system throughput. For example, indoor scenarios, especially industrial Internet scenarios for large-scale applications in the future, have a relatively high proportion of uplink services, and the same TDD timeslot ratio, which is adopted in outdoor scenarios, cannot meet the service requirements in industrial scenarios. Therefore, it is necessay to study the interference situation when using different TDD configurations in indoor and outdoor scenarios to provide a reference for TDD unsynchronized interference management in mobile communication systems.}

	abstract = {5G network consumes huge investment cost, including 5G network construction, 5G network operation and maintenance etc. Therefore, China Unicom and China Telecom take the initiative to jointly build the 5G network (wireless network sharing, independent construction mode of core network). Its aim is to reduce 5G overall investment cost, and rapidly realize the continuous and wide-area 5G service capability, as well as improve the network efficiency and asset operation efficiency. This paper focuses on the automatic data configuration model of 5G co-construction and shared base stations. By interacting with the core network and wireless network, this model can identify and match different 5G network modes such as SA and NSA (including dual-anchor scenarios and single-anchor scenarios). On this basis, the data required for automatic activation of the shared base stations is obtained from the wireless side and automatically configured on the core network side. This technology meets the practical needs of both sides for fast and efficient construction of 5G network. It can realize the automatic opening and fast on-line of co-construction and shared BS on the side of the core network.}

	abstract = {At present, data security has become a key area of attention from all aspects. The proliferation of data leakage incidents, the acceleration of the introduction of data security laws and regulations, and the rising cost of enterprise compliance punishment jointly urge all enterprises to step up to improve their own data security system. In the construction of data security, data desensitization is always a core technical ability. In view of the current situation and future development trend of data desensitization technology and products, this paper introduces the development of data desensitization technology in detail from desensitization algorithm, anonymization, static data desensitization and dynamic data desensitization. At the same time, from the core function, product form, supply side status and other aspects of the data desensitization technology are described. On this basis, the standardization direction of data desensitization products in terms of core functions, concept definition, performance and stability is proposed. Finally, the development trend of data desensitization technology and products in four aspects of regularization, anonymization, intellectualization and contextualization are put forward.}

	abstract = {Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring systems were effective ways to diagnose intermittent cardio diseases. However, the Electrode Motion Artifact (EMA) and the Muscle Artifact (MA) destroy the incipient shape of ECG signals, decrease the accuracy of diagnostic results. Here, we proposed a novel method for detecting destroyed segments of ECG signals. The method was based on a deep learning network, and its performance was evaluated on a synthetic dataset of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Its practicability was tested with three R-peak detection algorithms. By removing the destroyed segments in ECG signals, the sensitive and positive prediction of these R-peak detection algorithms were promoted significantly.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most recent advancements in wireless communication technology. It was introduced in cellular communication technology by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to lay a foundation for the evolving 5G architecture. It has now emerged as a promising technology for proximate devices. It enables proximate devices to communicate directly without the involvement of a third party network infrastructure. Researchers are analysing various methods to facilitate the smooth integration of D2D communication technology into the existing network system architecture. This paper lists all the different possible modes of operation in D2D communication based on the varying use-case scenarios and highlights the security and privacy requirements for D2D communication. Some of the recent authentication proposals for D2D communication technology are further reviewed, and their security and privacy capabilities are analysed. Apart from authentication, we also reviewed some recent proposals of access control in D2D and highlighted the security issues addressed. We then identified the open issues that prevail in implementing D2D technology in a real-world scenario for future researchers, emphasising the existing authentication and access control techniques in D2D communication.}

	abstract = {Neural networks have been widely used in privacy protection and intrusion detection. As the core algorithm of neural network optimization parameters, the gradient descent algorithm is an important reason for the wide application of neural networks. For the problem that Adam may have a low learning rate in the later stage and the possibility of surpassing the global optimum, this paper proposes a new algorithm IdiffGrad based on the ratio of the first-order moment square to the second-order moment on the basis of diffGrad. The algorithm adjusts the learning rate of different dimensions based on the local variation of the gradient of this dimension and the ratio of the square of the first moment to the second moment, so as to better meet the requirement of this dimension for learning rate. Comparing IdiffGrad with Adam and diffGrad through simulation. The simulation results show that the IdiffGrad algorithm is better in comprehensive performance. It has broad prospects in various intrusion detection schemes using neural networks.}
