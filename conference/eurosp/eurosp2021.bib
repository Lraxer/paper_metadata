	abstract = {Reverse engineering is a complex task. As with many other expert tasks, reverse engineers rely on colleagues and the broader reverse engineering community to provide guidance and develop knowledge necessary to achieve their goals. For example, it is common for reverse engineers to reach out for help to understand and effectively use new tools. Thus far, however, there has been limited investigation of the way knowledge is developed in this community and new tools are adopted. This paper takes a first step toward understanding reverse engineering community dynamics around tool adoption, using the release of the National Security Agency's Ghidra reverse engineering framework as a point of focus. In this paper, we review discussions about Ghidra to identify what features reverse engineers are most interested in, how reverse engineers develop knowledge about Ghidra together online, and whether these dynamics differ between forums. In total, we analyze 1590 reverse engineering discussions between 688 reverse engineers over 3 forums (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, and StackExchange). Our results suggest reverse engineers are most interested in features that allow them to customize Ghidra. We also observe limited evidence of collective sensemaking on the forums, with few reverse engineers participating in multiple discussions threads and most acting as either knowledge producers or consumers. Finally, we found that the forums operated similarly, but Twitter was most often used to announce information (e.g., tutorial links, tool overviews, vulnerabilities in Ghidra) and reverse engineers used StackExchange mostly to get support for specific problems. Reddit acted as a middle option. Based on these results, we make recommendations to improve reverse engineering tool development, improve community participation during adoption, and suggest directions for future work.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we highlight a fundamental vulnerability associated with the widely adopted “Just Tap” push-based authentication in the face of a concurrency attack, and propose the method REPLICATE, a redesign to counter this vulnerability. In the concurrency attack, the attacker launches the login session at the same time the user initiates a session, and the user may be fooled, with high likelihood, into accepting the push notification which corresponds to the attacker's session, thinking it is their own. The attack stems from the fact that the login notification is not explicitly mapped to the login session running on the browser in the Just Tap approach. REPLICATE attempts to address this fundamental flaw by having the user approve the login attempt by replicating the information presented on the browser session over to the login notification, such as by moving a key in a particular direction, choosing a particular shape, etc. We report on the design and a systematic usability study of REPLICATE. Even without being aware of the vulnerability, in general, participants placed multiple variants of REPLICATE in competition to the Just Tap and fairly above PIN-based authentication.}

	abstract = {In smart homes, access-control policies increasingly depend on contexts, such as who is taking an action, whether there is an emergency, or whether an adult is nearby. The vast literature on context sensing could potentially be leveraged to support contextual access control, yet this literature mostly ignores attacks, adversaries, and privacy. In this paper, we reevaluate the literature on home context sensing through a security and privacy mindset. We first describe a novel threat model in smart homes focusing on the capabilities of non-technical adversaries. Replay, imitation, and shoulder-surfing attacks are much more likely in this model. We summarize contexts relevant to access control in homes, mapping them to existing sensors. We then systematize the sensing literature to construct a decision framework for home context sensing that considers security, privacy, and usability. Applying our framework, we find that current sensors do not fully mitigate likely threats in homes. Some sensors are susceptible to simple threats like physical denial-of-service attacks, making it easy to bypass policies relying on the absence of a characteristic. Many sensors collect more data than needed and are not effective for all groups of users or under all situations.}

	abstract = {Modern messaging applications often rely on out-of-band communication to achieve entity authentication, with human users verifying and attesting to long-term public keys. This is done primarily to reduce reliance on trusted third parties by replacing that role with the user. Despite a great deal of research focusing on analyzing the confidentiality aspect of secure messaging, the entity authenticity aspect of it, which relies on the user mediation, has been largely assumed away. Consequently, while many existing protocols provide some confidentiality guarantees after a compromise, such as post-compromise security (PCS), authenticity guarantees are generally lost, especially against an active attacker. This leads to potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a model to formally capture user-mediated entity authentication, as used by realworld protocols, that can be composed with any ratcheted key exchange. Our threat model captures active post-compromise entity authentication security. We demonstrate that the Signal application's user-mediated authentication protocol cannot be proven secure in this model and suggest a straightforward fix for Signal that allows the detection of an active adversary. Our results have direct implications for other existing and future ratcheted secure messaging applications.}

  abstract = {The use of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) in two factor authentication (2FA) is fast emerging, as wearables promise better usability compared to smartphones. Still, the current deployments of wearable 2FA have significant usability and security issues. Specifically, one-time PIN-based wearable 2FA (PIN-2FA) requires noticeable user effort to open the app and copy random PINs from the wearable to the login terminal's (desktop/laptop) browser. An alternative approach, based on one-tap approvals via push notifications (Tap-2FA), relies upon user decision making to thwart attacks and is prone to skip-through. Both approaches are also vulnerable to traditional phishing attacks. To address this security-usability tension, we introduce a fundamentally different design of wearable 2FA, called SG-2FA, involving wrist-movement “seamless gestures” captured near transparently by the second factor wearable device while the user types a very short special sequence on the browser during the login process. The typing of the special sequence creates a wrist gesture that when identified correctly uniquely associates the login attempt with the device's owner. The special sequence can be fixed (e.g., “ {@} $ {@} $ {@}{\\$}{@}{\\$} ”), does not need to be a secret, and does not need to be memorized (could be simply displayed on the browser). This design improves usability over PIN-2FA since only this short sequence has to be typed as part of the login process (no interaction with or diversion of attention to the wearable and copying of random PINs is needed). It also greatly improves security compared to Tap-2FA since the attacker can not succeed in login unless the user's wrist is undergoing the exact same gesture at the exact same time. Moreover, the approach is phishing-resistant and privacy-preserving (unlike behavioral biometrics). Our results show that SG-2FA incurs only minimal errors in both benign and adversarial settings based on appropriate parameterizations.}

	abstract = {We provide a systematic analysis of two related multiparty protocols, namely (Non-Interactive Fully) Distributed Verifiable Random Functions (DVRFs) and Decentralised Random Beacons (DRBs), including their syntax and definition of robustness and privacy properties. These two protocols are run by multiple network nodes where each node contributes with a partial evaluation and the collection of these partial values is used to evaluate a pseudorandom function. We refine current pseudorandomness definitions for distributed functions and show that the privacy provided by strong pseudorandomness, where an adversary is allowed to make partial function evaluation queries on the challenge value, is strictly better than that provided by standard pseudorandomness, where such adversarial queries are disallowed. We provide two new DVRF instantiations, named DDH-DVRF and GLOW-DVRF, that meet strong pseudorandomness under widely accepted cryptographic assumptions. We show the usefulness of our DRB formalism in two different ways. Firstly, we give a rigorous treatment of a folklore generic construction that builds a Decentralized Random Beacon from any DVRF instance and prove that it satisfies robustness and pseudorandomness provided that the original DVRF protocol is secure. Secondly, we capture several existing DRB protocols from academia and industry within our framework, which serves as an evidence of its wider applicability. Finally, we report on experimental evaluations of our newly introduced DVRFs with implementations under different cryptographic libraries, and we also report preliminary benchmark results on two of the DRBs obtained from the generic DVRF-to-DRB transformation. Our benchmarks can be independently verified as we provide an open source C++ reference implementation of the new DVRFs. Finally, we conclude that our new DRB instantiations are the most efficient instantiations currently available while enjoying strong and formally proven security properties.}

	abstract = {Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that are executed across a blockchain. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be modified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting target for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing millions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on symbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation. Recently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts. However, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving low code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to achieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination of symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on smart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart contracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex conditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts. Moreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius by comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for smart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and a dataset of 21K real-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs than state-of-the-art tools (up to 23%) and that it outperforms existing tools in terms of code coverage (up to 69%). We also demonstrate that data dependency analysis can boost bug detection up to 18%.}

	abstract = {Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryp-tocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through cryptojacking malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging crypto-jacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features. However, the literature lacks a systemic study with a deep understanding of the emerging cryptojacking malware and a comprehensive review of studies in the literature. To fill this gap in the literature, in this SoK paper, we present a systematic overview of cryptojacking malware based on the information obtained from the combination of academic research papers, two large cryptojacking datasets of samples, and 45 major attack instances. Finally, we also present lessons learned and new research directions to help the research community in this emerging area.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies offer an appealing alternative to Fiat currencies, due to their decentralized and borderless nature. However the decentralized settings make the authentication process more challenging: Standard cryptographic methods often rely on the ability of users to reliably store a (large) secret information. What happens if one user's key is lost or stolen? Blockchain systems lack of fallback mechanisms that allow one to recover from such an event, whereas the traditional banking system has developed and deploys quite effective solutions. In this work, we develop new cryptographic techniques to integrate security policies (developed in the traditional banking domain) in the blockchain settings. We propose a system where a smart contract is given the custody of the user's funds and has the ability to invoke a two-factor authentication (2FA) procedure in case of an exceptional event (e.g., a particularly large transaction or a key recovery request). To enable this, the owner of the account secret-shares the answers of some security questions among a committee of users. When the 2FA mechanism is triggered, the committee members can provide the smart contract with enough information to check whether an attempt was successful, and nothing more. We then design a protocol that securely and efficiently implements such a functionality: The protocol is round-optimal, is robust to the corruption of a subset of committee members, supports low-entropy secrets, and is concretely efficient. As a stepping stone towards the design of this protocol, we introduce a new threshold homomorphic encryption scheme for linear predicates from bilinear maps, which might be of independent interest. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implement the above protocol as a smart contract in Ethereum and show that it can be used today as an additional safeguard for suspicious transactions, at minimal added cost. We also implement a second scheme where the smart contract additionally requests a signature from a physical hardware token, whose verification key is registered upfront by the owner of the funds. We show how to integrate the widely used universal two-factor authentication (U2F) tokens in blockchain environments, thus enabling the deployment of our system with available hardware.}

	abstract = {A recent source of concern for the security of neural networks is the emergence of clean-label dataset poisoning attacks, wherein correctly labeled poison samples are injected into the training dataset. While these poison samples look legitimate to the human observer, they contain malicious characteristics that trigger a targeted misclassification during inference. We propose a scalable and transferable clean-label poisoning attack against transfer learning, which creates poison images with their center close to the target image in the feature space. Our attack, Bullseye Polytope, improves the attack success rate of the current state-of-the-art by 26.75% in end-to-end transfer learning, while increasing attack speed by a factor of 12. We further extend Bullseye Polytope to a more practical attack model by including multiple images of the same object (e.g., from different angles) when crafting the poison samples. We demonstrate that this extension improves attack transferability by over 16% to unseen images (of the same object) without using extra poison samples.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new paradigm of building natural language processing (NLP) systems: general-purpose, pre-trained language models (LMs) are composed with simple downstream models and fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks. This paradigm shift significantly simplifies the system development cycles. However, as many LMs are provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security implications, which are largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work studies the security threats posed by malicious LMs to NLP systems. Specifically, we present Trojan LM , a new class of trojaning attacks in which maliciously crafted LMs trigger host NLP systems to malfunction in a highly predictable manner. By empirically studying three state-of-the-art LMs (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) in a range of security-critical NLP tasks (toxic comment detection, question answering, text completion) as well as user studies on crowdsourcing platforms, we demonstrate that Trojan LM  possesses the following properties: (i) flexibility - the adversary is able to flexibly define logical combinations (e.g., ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘xor’) of arbitrary words as triggers, (ii) efficacy - the host systems misbehave as desired by the adversary with high probability when “trigger” -embedded inputs are present, (iii) specificity - the trojan LMs function indistinguishably from their benign counterparts on clean inputs, and (iv) fluency - the trigger-embedded inputs appear as fluent natural language and highly relevant to their surrounding contexts. We provide analytical justification for the practicality of Trojan LM , and further discuss potential countermeasures and their challenges, which lead to several promising research directions.}

	abstract = {The increased demand for machine learning applications made companies offer Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS). In MLaaS (a market estimated 8000M USD by 2025), users pay for well-performing ML models without dealing with the complicated training procedure. Among MLaaS, text-based applications are the most popular ones (e.g., language translators). Given this popularity, MLaaS must provide resiliency to adversarial manipulations. For example, a wrong translation might lead to a misunderstanding between two parties. In the text domain, state-of-the-art attacks mainly focus on strategies that leverage ML models' weaknesses. Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to the other pipeline' stages, such as the indexing stage (i.e., when a sentence is converted from a textual to a numerical representation) that, if manipulated, can significantly affect the final performance of the application. In this paper, we propose a novel text evasion technique called “Zero-Width attack” (ZeW) that leverages the injection of human non-readable characters, affecting indexing stage mechanisms. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective attack deceives MLaaS of “giants” such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Our case study, based on the manipulation of hateful tweets, shows that out of 12 analyzed services, only one is resistant to our injection strategy. We finally introduce and test a simple input validation defense that can prevent our proposed attack.}

	abstract = {The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers' focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure's translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective.}

	abstract = {With an increase in low-cost machine learning APIs, advanced machine learning models may be trained on private datasets and monetized by providing them as a service. However, privacy researchers have demonstrated that these models may leak information about records in the training dataset via membership inference attacks. In this paper, we take a closer look at another inference attack reported in literature, called attribute inference, whereby an attacker tries to infer missing attributes of a partially known record used in the training dataset by accessing the machine learning model as an API. We show that even if a classification model succumbs to membership inference attacks, it is unlikely to be susceptible to attribute inference attacks. We demonstrate that this is because membership inference attacks fail to distinguish a member from a nearby non-member. We call the ability of an attacker to distinguish the two (similar) vectors as strong membership inference. We show that membership inference attacks cannot infer membership in this strong setting, and hence inferring attributes is infeasible. However, under a relaxed notion of attribute inference, called approximate attribute inference, we show that it is possible to infer attributes close to the true attributes. We verify our results on three publicly available datasets, five membership, and three attribute inference attacks reported in literature.}

	abstract = {The recently proposed DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol is becoming increasingly popular in addressing the privacy concerns of exchanging plain-text DNS messages over potentially malicious transit networks (e.g., mass surveillance at ISPs). By employing HTTPS to encrypt DNS communications, DoH traffic inherently becomes indistinguishable from regular encrypted Web traffic, rendering active disruption (e.g., downgrading to the plain-text DNS) by transit networks extremely hard. In this work, we investigate whether DoH traffic is indeed indistinguishable from encrypted Web traffic. To this end, we collect several DoH traffic traces corresponding to 25 resolvers (including major ones, e.g., Google and Cloudftare) by visiting thousands of domains in Alexa's list of top-ranked websites at different geographical locations and environments. Based on the collected traffic, we train a machine learning model to classify HTTPS traffic as either Web or DoH. With our DoH identification model in place, we show that an authoritarian ISP can identify ∼97.4% (∼90%) of the DoH packets correctly in a closed-world (open-world) setting while only misclassifying 1 in 10,000 Web packets. To counter this DoH identification model, we propose an effective mitigation technique, making the identification model impractical for ISPs to filter and consequently downgrade DoH to plain-text DNS communications.}

	abstract = {The ultimate goal in modern secure e-voting is to enable everyone to verify whether the final election result correctly reflects the votes chosen by the (human) voters, without exposing how each individual voted. These fundamental security properties are called end-to-end verifiability and voter privacy. Unfortunately, it turns out to be very challenging to pursue these properties simultaneously, especially when the latter must be future-proofed against the rise of quantum computers. In this work, we show, for the first time, a practical approach to do this. We present Epoque, the first end-to-end verifiable, voter-private, post-quantum-secure homomorphic e-voting protocol. It achieves its properties through the combination of practical lattice-based cryptographic primitives only, in a novel way. We formally prove all our security claims under common trust and hardness assumptions. At the core of Epoque lies an efficient identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme with blazingly fast master-key decryption. It is the component that makes the efficient tallying of thousands or millions of ballots a practical possibility. In order to demonstrate its practicality, we fully implemented it and provide detailed benchmarks; we believe this latter contribution is of independent interest beyond the specific e-voting application.}

	abstract = {Algorithmic fairness and privacy are essential pillars of trustworthy machine learning. Fair machine learning aims at minimizing discrimination against protected groups by, for example, imposing a constraint on models to equalize their behavior across different groups. This can subsequently change the influence of training data points on the fair model, in a disproportionate way. We study how this can change the information leakage of the model about its training data. We analyze the privacy risks of group fairness (e.g., equalized odds) through the lens of membership inference attacks: inferring whether a data point is used for training a model. We show that fairness comes at the cost of privacy, and this cost is not distributed equally: the information leakage of fair models increases significantly on the unprivileged subgroups, which are the ones for whom we need fair learning. We show that the more biased the training data is, the higher the privacy cost of achieving fairness for the unprivileged subgroups will be. We provide comprehensive empirical analysis for general machine learning algorithms.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning allows distributed entities to train a common model collaboratively without sharing their own data. Although it prevents data collection and aggregation by exchanging only parameter updates, it remains vulnerable to various inference and reconstruction attacks where a malicious entity can learn private information about the participants' training data from the captured gradients. Differential Privacy is used to obtain theoretically sound privacy guarantees against such inference attacks by noising the exchanged update vectors. However, the added noise is proportional to the model size which can be very large with modern neural networks. This can result in poor model quality. In this paper, compressive sensing is used to reduce the model size and hence increase model quality without sacrificing privacy. We show experimentally, using 2 datasets, that our privacy-preserving proposal can reduce the communication costs by up to 95 % with only a negligible performance penalty compared to traditional non-private federated learning schemes.}

The technical capabilities of attacks against encrypted Internet traffic have come a long way. Although the current state-of-the-art predicts high precision and accuracy for website fingerprinting and end-to-end confirmation, the concepts of these attacks often solely focus on their technical capabilities and ignore the operational requirements that are mandatory to get access to transmissions. In this work, we introduce three novel stepping-stone attacks that enable an adversary to (i) gain additional information about monitored connections, (ii) manipulate the Tor connection build-up, and (iii) conduct a targeted Denial-of-Service attack within the Tor infrastructure. All attacks exploit core defensive features of Tor and, consequently, are hard to patch. At the same time, our attacks are in line with standard attacker models for traffic analysis attacks. We demonstrate the feasibility of all three attacks in simulations and empirical case studies and emphasize their pivotal role in preparing a realistic setting for end-to-end confirmation attacks.}

	abstract = {For the mitigation of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices we rely on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their users. Given that devices are in the hands of their subscribers, what can ISPs realistically do? This study examines the effects of ISP countermeasures on infections caused by variants of the notorious Mirai family of IoT malware, still among the dominant families. We collect and analyze more than 4 years of longitudinal darknet data tracking Mirai-like infections in conjunction with threat intelligence data on various other IoT and non-IoT botnets across the globe from January 2016 to May 2020. We measure the effect of two ISP countermeasures on Mirai variant infection numbers: (i) reducing the attack surface (i.e., closing ports that are used by the malware for propagation) and (ii) ISPs increasing their general network hygiene and malware removal efforts (as observed by proxy of the remediation of infections of other families of IoT and non-IoT malware and reductions in the number of DDoS amplifiers in their networks). We map our infection data to 342 broadband providers that have the bulk of the broadband market share in their respective 83 countries. We find that the number of infections correlates strongly with the number of ISP subscribers ($R^{2}=0.55$). Yet, infection numbers can still vary by three orders of magnitude even for ISPs with comparable subscriber numbers. We observe that many ISPs, together with their subscribers, have reduced their attack surface for IoT compromise by blocking traffic to commonly-exploited infection vectors such as Telnet and FTP. We statistically estimate the impact of these reductions on infection levels and, counter-intuitively, find no significant impact. In contrast, we do find a significant impact for improving general network hygiene and best malware mitigation practices. ISPs that were more successful in reducing DDoS amplifiers and non-Mirai malware infections in their networks also end up with significantly lower Mirai infection rates. In other words, rather than investing in IoT-specific countermeasures like reducing the attack surface, our findings suggest that ISPs might be better off investing in general security efforts to improve network hygiene and clean up abuse.}

	abstract = {Ransomware attacks continue to grow in both severity and prevalence as attackers target public infrastructure, governments, and companies. This problem has spawned a wide range of anti-ransomware techniques which are evaluated by their capability of detecting known samples, but these samples are difficult to obtain and unreliable. Due to polymorphism and the ease of implementing new methods of attack, anti-ransomware is more likely needed to protect against an unknown binary than a known sample. In this paper, we create an extensible framework (Farfel) for testing anti-ransomware products that does not rely on evaluation with known samples. Our framework consists of 21 unique fundamental behavior variations which can be selected to form 1,536 unique attacks. Using this, we evaluate seven commercial and academic anti-ransomware products to identify gaps in coverage of fundamental behaviors. Our evaluation uncovers significant gaps in every product, with three commercial products detecting zero cases. We believe that testing on a wide variety of behaviors will ultimately result in more effective detectors in the future.}

	abstract = {Digitization has been rapidly integrated with manufacturing industries and critical infrastructure to increase efficiency, productivity, and reduce wastefulness, a transition being labeled as Industry 4.0. However, this expansion, coupled with the poor cybersecurity posture of these Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, has made them prolific targets for exploitation. Moreover, modern Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) used in the Operational Technology (OT) sector are adopting open-source operating systems such as Linux instead of proprietary software, making such devices susceptible to Linux-based malware. Traditional malware detection approaches cannot be applied directly or extended to such environments due to the unique restrictions of these PLC devices, such as limited computational power and real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose ORRIS, a novel lightweight and out-of-the-device framework that detects malware at both kernel and user-level by processing the information collected using the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface. We evaluate ORRIS against in-the-wild Linux malware achieving maximum detection accuracy of ≈99.7% with very few false-positive occurrences, a result comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial products. Moreover, we also develop and demonstrate a real-time implementation of ORRIS for commercial PLCs.}

	abstract = {Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) play a critical role in the industrial control systems. Vulnerabilities in PLC programs might lead to attacks causing devastating consequences to the critical infrastructure, as shown in Stuxnet and similar attacks. In recent years, we have seen an exponential increase in vulnerabilities reported for PLC control logic. Looking back on past research, we found extensive studies explored control logic modification attacks, as well as formal verification-based security solutions. We performed systematization on these studies, and found attacks that can compromise a full chain of control and evade detection. However, the majority of the formal verification research investigated ad-hoc techniques targeting PLC programs. We discovered challenges in every aspect of formal verification, rising from (1) the ever-expanding attack surface from evolved system design, (2) the real-time constraint during the program execution, and (3) the barrier in security evaluation given proprietary and vendor-specific dependencies on different techniques. Based on the knowledge systematization, we provide a set of recommendations for future research directions, and we highlight the need of defending security issues besides safety issues.}

	abstract = {We uncover a previously unknown, ongoing as-troturfing attack on the popularity mechanisms of social media platforms: ephemeral astroturfing attacks. In this attack, a chosen keyword or topic is artificially promoted by coordinated and inauthentic activity to appear popular, and, crucially, this activity is removed as part of the attack. We observe such attacks on Twitter trends and find that these attacks are not only successful but also pervasive. We detected over 19,000 unique fake trends promoted by over 108,000 accounts, including not only fake but also compromised accounts, many of which remained active and continued participating in the attacks. Trends astroturfed by these attacks account for at least 20% of the top 10 global trends. Ephemeral astroturfing threatens the integrity of popularity mechanisms on social media platforms and by extension the integrity of the platforms.}

	abstract = {Amplification DDoS attacks inherently rely on IP spoofing to steer attack traffic to the victim. At the same time, IP spoofing undermines prosecution, as the originating attack infrastructure remains hidden. Researchers have therefore proposed various mechanisms to trace back amplification attacks (or IP-spoofed attacks in general). However, existing traceback techniques require either the cooperation of external parties or a priori knowledge about the attacker. We propose BGPEEK-A-Boo, a BGP-based approach to trace back amplification attacks to their origin network. BGPEEK-A-Boo monitors amplification attacks with honeypots and uses BGP Poisoning to temporarily shut down ingress traffic from selected Autonomous Systems. By systematically probing the entire AS space, we detect systems forwarding and originating spoofed traffic. We then show how a graph-based model of BGP route propagation can reduce the search space, resulting in a 5 x median speed-up and over 20x for ¼ of all cases. BGPEEK-A-Boo achieves a unique traceback result 60% of the time in a simulation-based evaluation supported by real-world experiments.}

	abstract = {Asset discovery is fundamental to any organization's cybersecurity efforts. Indeed, one must accurately know which assets belong to an IT infrastructure before the infrastructure can be secured. While practitioners typically rely on a relatively small set of well-known techniques, the academic literature on the subject is voluminous. In particular, the Internet measurement research community has devised a number of asset discovery techniques to support many measurement studies over the past five years. In this paper, we systematize asset discovery techniques by constructing a framework that comprehensively captures how network identifiers and services are found. We extract asset discovery techniques from recent academic literature in security and networking and place them into the systematized framework. We then demonstrate how to apply the framework to several case studies of asset discovery workflows, which could aid research reproducibility. These case studies further suggest opportunities for researchers and practitioners to uncover and identify more assets than might be possible with traditional techniques.}

	abstract = {The Android platform gives mobile device users the opportunity to extend the capabilities of their systems by installing developer-authored apps. Companies leverage this capability to reach their customers and conduct business operations such as financial transactions. End-users can obtain custom Android applications (apps) from the Google Play, some of which are security-sensitive due to the nature of the data that they handle, such as apps from the FINANCE category. Although there are recommendations and standardized guidelines for secure app development with various self-defense techniques, the adoption of such methods is not mandatory and is left to the discretion of developers. Unfortunately, malicious actors can tamper with the app runtime environment and then exploit the attack vectors which arise from the tampering, such as executing foreign code with elevated privileges on the mobile platform. In this paper, we present AppJITSU, a dynamic app analysis framework that evaluates the resiliency of security-critical apps. We exercise the most popular 455 financial apps in attack-specific hostile environments to demonstrate the current state of resiliency against known tampering methods. Our results indicate that 25.05% of the tested apps have no resiliency against any common hostile methods or tools, whereas only 10.77% employed all defensive methods.}

	abstract = {JavaScript-based timing attacks have been greatly explored over the last few years. They rely on subtle timing differences to infer information that should not be available inside of the JavaScript sandbox. In reaction to these attacks, the W3C and browser vendors have implemented several countermeasures, with an important focus on JavaScript timers. However, as these attacks multiplied in the last years, so did the countermeasures, in a cat-and-mouse game fashion. In this paper, we present the evolution and current situation of timing attacks in browsers, as well as statistical tools to characterize available timers. Our goal is to present a clear view of the attack surface and understand: what are the main prerequisites and classes of browser-based timing attacks and what are the main countermeasures. We focus on determining to what extent the changes on timing-based countermeasures impact browser security. In particular, we show that the shift in protecting against transient execution attacks has re-enabled other attacks such as microarchitec-tural side-channel attacks with a higher bandwidth than what was possible just two years ago.}

	abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly deployed in datacenters due to their inherent flexibility over ASICs or GPUs that makes them an ideal processing unit for emerging and dynamic area of deep learning and other techniques and algorithms that are rapidly evolving. To maximize their utilization in the cloud, researchers have proposed the spatial multi-tenant deployment model, where the FPGA fabric is simultaneously shared among mutually distrusting tenants. This is enabled by leveraging the partial reconfiguration capability of FPGAs. In this paper, we systematize the research work on multi-tenant FPGAs in cloud computing settings and highlight their adversary models, security guarantees, as well as their fundamental security and privacy related shortcomings. We further categorize existing research works that demonstrate a new class of remotely-exploitable physical attacks on multi-tenant FPGAs by malicious tenants sharing physical resources with the victims. Through investigating end-to-end multi-tenant FPGA deployment comprehensively, we reveal that these attacks represent only one dimension of the problem, while various open security and privacy challenges remain unaddressed. We conclude with our insights on future research challenges and open opportunities.}

	abstract = {We present the first side-channel attack on full-fledged smartphones that recovers the elliptic curve secret scalar from the electromagnetic signal that corresponds to a single scalar-by-point multiplication in current versions of Libgcrypt, OpenSSL, HACL* and curve25519-donna. To avoid leaking information via side channels, these implementations follow the recommendations of RFC 7748 and use a constant-time conditional swap operation. Our attack targets signal differences created by systematic changes in operand values during this conditional swap operation. We deploy the attack, using low-cost equipment (<$800), against two Android-based mobile phones and against a Linux-based IoT development board. We repeat the attack 100 times, each time with a different scalar, on each device. In all of the implementations considered in this work, our attack successfully recovers the full secret key within seconds. To mitigate the attack we suggest randomizing the exclusive-or mask in the conditional swap operation. We show that this countermeasure is effective in preventing this and similar attacks.}

	abstract = {We present  DY ⋆ \\text{DY}^{\\star} , a new formal verification framework for the symbolic security analysis of cryptographic protocol code written in the  F ⋆ \\mathrm{F}^{\\star}  programming language. Unlike automated symbolic provers, our framework accounts for advanced protocol features like unbounded loops and mutable recursive data structures, as well as low-level implementation details like protocol state machines and message formats, which are often at the root of real-world attacks. Our work extends a long line of research on using dependent type systems for this task, but takes a fundamentally new approach by explicitly modeling the global trace-based semantics within the framework, hence bridging the gap between trace-based and type-based protocol analyses. This approach enables us to uniformly, precisely, and soundly model, for the first time using dependent types, long-lived mutable protocol state, equational theories, fine-grained dynamic corruption, and trace-based security properties like forward secrecy and post-compromise security.  DY ⋆ \\text{DY}^{\\star}  is built as a library of  F ⋆ \\mathrm{F}^{\\star}  modules that includes a model of low-level protocol execution, a Dolev-Yao symbolic attacker, and generic security abstractions and lemmas, all verified using  F ⋆ \\mathrm{F}^{\\star} . The library exposes a high-level API that facilitates succinct security proofs for protocol code. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed symbolic security analysis of the Signal protocol that is based on an interoperable implementation of the protocol from prior work, and is the first mechanized proof of Signal to account for forward and post-compromise security over an unbounded number of protocol rounds.}

	abstract = {Nontransitive Noninterference (NTNI) and Nontransitive Types (NTT) are a new security condition and enforcement for policies which, in contrast to Denning's classical lattice model, assume no transitivity of the underlying flow relation. Nontransitive security policies are a natural fit for coarse-grained information-flow control where labels are specified at module rather than variable level of granularity. While the nontransitive and transitive policies pursue different goals and have different intuitions, this paper demonstrates that nontransitive noninterference can in fact be reduced to classical transitive noninterference. We develop a lattice encoding that establishes a precise relation between NTNI and classical noninterference. Our results make it possible to clearly position the new NTNI characterization with respect to the large body of work on noninterference. Further, we devise a lightweight program transformation that leverages standard flow-sensitive information-flow analyses to enforce nontransitive policies. We demonstrate several immediate benefits of our approach, both theoretical and practical. First, we improve the permissiveness over (while retaining the soundness of) the nonstandard NTT enforcement. Second, our results naturally generalize to a language with intermediate inputs and outputs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical benefits by utilizing state-of-the-art flow-sensitive tool JOANA to enforce nontransitive policies for Java programs.}

	abstract = {Android's security model severely limits the capabilities of anti-malware software. Unlike commodity anti-malware solutions on desktop systems, their Android counterparts run as sandboxed applications without root privileges and are limited by Android's permission system. As such, PHAs on Android are usually willingly installed by victims, as they come disguised as useful applications with hidden malicious functionality, and are encountered on mobile app stores as suggestions based on the apps that a user previously installed. Users with similar interests and app installation history are likely to be exposed and to decide to install the same PHA. This observation gives us the opportunity to develop predictive approaches that can warn the user about which PHAs they will encounter and potentially be tempted to install in the near future. These approaches could then be used to complement commodity anti-malware solutions, which are focused on post-fact detection, closing the window of opportunity that existing solutions suffer from. In this paper we develop ANDRuspex, a system based on graph representation learning, allowing us to learn latent relationships between user devices and PHAs and leverage them for prediction. We test ANDRuspex on a real world dataset of PHA installations collected by a security company, and show that our approach achieves very high prediction results (up to 0.994 TPR at 0.0001 FPR), while at the same time outperforming alternative baseline methods. We also demonstrate that ANDRuspex is robust and its runtime performance is acceptable for a real world deployment.}

	abstract = {Phishing continues to be a major security concern for organizations around the globe. Past works proposed classifiers to detect phishing emails; however many of them are based on rules, whereas others are typically standalone models focusing on one specific component of emails (say, URL strings). In this work, we take a different approach and propose a multi-modular and comprehensive phishing email detection system, called D-Fence. The different modules of D-Fence — structure module, text module, and URL module — detect phishing attempts in different components of an email. This allows D-Fence to cover larger attack surfaces while also offering flexible (model) configurations with reduced computational overhead. We carry out experiments on a large-scale real-world email dataset comprising mails from multiple enterprises. Our evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Fence in detecting phishing emails that do not have malicious intentions manifesting in all email components; D-Fence achieves a high recall of 0.99 at a low false-positive rate of 1 in 10K. Furthermore, we perform systematic evaluations to find and evaluate cost-efficient model configurations for D-Fence; the results reveal that D-Fence maintains high detection capability while bringing significant savings in computational time.}

	abstract = {The knowledge on attacks contained in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports is very important to effectively identify and quickly respond to cyber threats. However, this knowledge is often embedded in large amounts of text, and therefore difficult to use effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach and tool called Extractor that allows precise automatic extraction of concise attack behaviors from CTI reports. Extractor makes no strong assumptions about the text and is capable of extracting attack behaviors as provenance graphs from unstructured text. We evaluate Extractor using real-world incident reports from various sources as well as reports of DARPA adversarial engagements that involve several attack campaigns on various OS platforms of Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Our evaluation results show that Extractor can extract concise provenance graphs from CTI reports and show that these graphs can successfully be used by cyber-analytics tools in threat-hunting.}

	abstract = {Several techniques have been proposed to detect vulnerable Spectre gadgets in widely deployed commercial software. Unfortunately, detection techniques proposed so far rely on hand-written rules which fall short in covering subtle variations of known Spectre gadgets as well as demand a huge amount of time to analyze each conditional branch in software. Moreover, detection tool evaluations are based only on a handful of these gadgets, as it requires arduous effort to craft new gadgets manually. In this work, we employ both fuzzing and deep learning techniques to automate the generation and detection of Spectre gadgets. We first create a diverse set of Spectre-V1 gadgets by introducing perturbations to the known gadgets. Using mutational fuzzing, we produce a data set with more than 1 million Spectre-V1 gadgets which is the largest Spectre gadget data set built to date. Next, we conduct the first empirical usability study of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the context of assembly code generation without any human interaction. We introduce SpectreGAN which leverages masking implementation of GANs for both learning the gadget structures and generating new gadgets. This provides the first scalable solution to extend the variety of Spectre gadgets. Finally, we propose FastSpec which builds a classifier with the generated Spectre gadgets based on a novel high dimensional Neural Embeddings technique (BERT). For the case studies, we demonstrate that FastSpec discovers potential gadgets with a high success rate in OpenSSL libraries and Phoronix benchmarks. Further, FastSpec offers much greater flexibility and time-related performance gain compared to the existing tools and therefore can be used for gadget detection in large-scale software.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of memory corruption bugs in the past decades resulted in numerous defenses, such as stack canaries, control flow integrity (CFI), and memory-safe languages. These defenses can prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities, and help increase the security posture of a program. In this paper, we show that memory corruption defenses can be bypassed using speculative execution attacks. We study the cases of stack protectors, CFI, and bounds checks in Go, demonstrating under which conditions they can be bypassed by a form of speculative control flow hijack, relying on speculative or architectural overwrites of control flow data. Information is leaked by redirecting the speculative control flow of the victim to a gadget accessing secret data and acting as a side channel send. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that this can be achieved by stitching together multiple gadgets, in a speculative return-oriented programming attack. We discuss and implement software mitigations, showing moderate performance impact.}

	abstract = {The vast majority of nowadays remote code execution attacks target virtual function tables (vtables). Attackers hijack vtable pointers to change the control flow of a vulnerable program to their will, resulting in full control over the underlying system. In this paper, we present NoVT, a compiler-based defense against vtable hijacking. Instead of protecting vtables for virtual dispatch, our solution replaces them with switch-case constructs that are inherently control-flow safe, thus preserving control flow integrity of C++ virtual dispatch. NoVT extends Clang to perform a class hierarchy analysis on C++ source code. Instead of a vtable, each class gets unique identifier numbers which are used to dispatch the correct method implementation. Thereby, NoVT inherently protects all usages of a vtable, not just virtual dispatch. We evaluate NoVT on common benchmark applications and real-world programs including Chromium. Despite its strong security guarantees, NoVT improves runtime performance of most programs (mean overhead −0.5%, −3.7% min, 2% max). In addition, protected binaries are slightly smaller than unprotected ones. NoVT works on different CPU architectures and protects complex C++ programs against strong attacks like COOP and ShrinkWrap.}

	abstract = {Recent controlled-channel attacks exploit timing differences in the rudimentary fetch-decode-execute logic of processors. These new attacks also pose a threat to software on embedded systems. Even when Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are used, interrupt latency attacks allow untrusted code to extract application secrets from a vulnerable enclave by scheduling interruption of the enclave. Constant-time programming is effective against these attacks but, as we explain in this paper, can come with some disadvantages regarding performance. To deal with this new threat, we propose a novel algorithm that hardens programs during compilation by aligning the execution time of corresponding instructions in secret-dependent branches. Our results show that, on a class of embedded systems with deterministic execution times, this approach eliminates interrupt latency side-channel leaks and mitigates limitations of constant-time programming. We have implemented our approach in the LLVM compiler infrastructure for the San-cus TEE, which extends the openMSP430 microcontroller, and we discuss applicability to other architectures. We make our implementation and benchmarks available for further research.}

	abstract = {Microarchitectural side channel attacks have been very prominent in security research over the last few years. Caches proved to be an outstanding side channel, as they provide high resolution and generic cross-core leakage. All major cryptographic libraries provide countermeasures to hinder key extraction via cross-core cache attacks by now. In this paper, we analyze implementations protected by prefetch-based countermeasures aimed at preventing well-known cache attacks, and highlight the circumstances causing them to remain vulnerable. Further, we craft a novel attack technique that precisely synchronizes the attacking and the victim processes, enabling the attacking process to evict the target data from the cache at the desired instants. One key improvement of our approach is that it provides unprivileged attackers with a method to remove specific data from the cache with a single memory access and in absence of shared memory by leveraging the transient capabilities of TSX and relying on the L3 replacement policy. We show the feasibility of our approach by extracting an RSA key from the latest wolfSSL library and an AES key from the T-Table and S-Box implementations included in OpenSSL with CacheSniper. Both libraries implement prefetch-based methods as a protection against cache attacks.}

Several approaches have been proposed to overcome this, based on multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, etc.; many of these protocols are slow and impractical for real-world use as they involve a large number of cryptographic operations. In this paper, we propose the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), which provide a platform for isolated execution of code and handling of data, for this purpose. We describe Flatee, an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning framework across TEEs, which considerably reduces training and communication time. Our framework can handle malicious parties (we do not natively solve adversarial data poisoning, though we describe a preliminary approach to handle this).}

Although in the presence of obfuscation techniques that can prevent static or symbolic binary analysis, a malware researcher may obtain detailed information about malware type and identification using our method by leveraging side channel by electromagnetism rather than software-layer malware analysis. By capturing 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT system infected with different malware samples, we can obtain this information without altering the actual hardware. As a result, it can be implemented without any overhead, regardless of the resources available. Furthermore, our method has the advantage of non-trivial for malware authors to avoid. We were able to distinguish malware families based on side-channel knowledge without being able to see what exact hardware was involved. We were able to predict three generic malware forms (and one benign class) with a 99.89% percent accuracy in our tests. Furthermore, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts.}

The immutability, however, also introduces threats and challenges with respect to privacy laws and illegal content. Introducing a certain degree of mutability, which enables the possibility to store and remove information, can therefore increase the opportunities for blockchains.

Since our concept is agnostic to any consensus algorithms, it can be implemented with permissioned and permissionless blockchains.}
